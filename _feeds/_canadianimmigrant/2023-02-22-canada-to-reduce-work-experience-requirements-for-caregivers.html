<p>For decades, caregivers from abroad have played a critical role in supporting families in Canada. Recognizing the urgent need for caregiving support, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) has announced that Canadian work experience required for a caregiver to qualify for permanent residence is being reduced from 24 months to 12 months. Caregivers and their families will now benefit from a faster path to permanent residence.</p> <p>In addition, some spaces under the existing caregiver pathways have been reserved for caregivers who already have work experience in Canada from a previous work permit so that they are able to apply for permanent residence.</p> <p>The shift in criteria will apply to applicants from both the Home Child Care Provider (HCCP) pilot and the Home Support Worker (HSW) pilot, including those whose applications have already been received by IRCC and prospective applicants for the remainder of the five&#x2011;year pilots. Since the launch of the pilots in 2019, nearly 1,600 caregivers and their family members have become permanent residents. In 2022 alone, nearly 1,100 caregivers and their family members became permanent residents through the two pilots.&#xA0;The change will be effective as of April 30, 2023, and will be retrospective for caregivers who have already applied.</p> <p>This update is expected to benefit around 90% of applications currently in processing, an advantage for both the caregivers who are just starting out and those who have been providing care in Canada.</p>
