<p><strong>Build and strengthen relationships for better health</strong></p> <p>We all go through difficult periods in life. Having supportive people to count on can make the difference in managing those difficult times. Research has shown that having good social relationships contributes to improved psychological and physical well-being. In particular, social support can serve as a protective factor with newcomers and immigrants and also groups such as the elderly who have declining health and cognitive abilities, individuals with mental illnesses and those marginalized due to a disability, race, gender or sexual orientation.</p> <p>Developing and maintaining an adequate social network of people who you can talk to, spend time with, ask for help and feel supported is not easy for everyone. Barriers such as, not finding the time, language issues, moving to a new place, lacking social skills, low self-esteem, unwelcoming communities, poverty are a few factors that could interfere in expanding supportive relationships.</p> <p><strong>Here are general tips on how to create and expand a social support network and stay connected: </strong></p> <ol> <li>Evaluate your social support and connections by making a list of people (family, friends, colleagues) that you think are positive and supportive to you.</li> <li>Highlight the individuals that you are in touch with on a regular basis and who check on your well-being. Reciprocate by staying connected with phone calls, texts or visits and communicate with them.</li> <li>Identify supportive individuals who live near you and can come to your assistance in case of an emergency. Having few reliable and supportive people in the neighborhood can help build a compassionate community and also promote safety and care by looking out for others.</li> <li>Create a list of formal support systems such as professionals whom you can trust and share concerns or worries about yourself or your family members. Family doctors, specialists, teachers, settlement counselors or therapists can be of help to discuss issues that may require professional opinions.</li> <li>Research and monitor online support networks and other social networking sites that help you stay in touch with others to connect and share your thoughts. They are convenient, can help overcome accessibility barriers and are usually free compared to other traditional sources of support such as therapy services. You may however have to monitor how much information you share about yourself on these sites due to privacy concerns and if you are relying too much on them rather than face-face interactions.</li> <li>Learn to identify areas where and why you do not have an adequate social support network and target strategies to enhance and build more support. With the right attitude and your efforts new and effective relationships can be cultivated and strengthened. Some helpful strategies are:</li> <li>Skills development: If you have difficulties such as anxieties of approaching people, communications skills issues, low self-esteem and low confidence, you can create a plan to develop and improve with skills building groups, or work individually with a coach.</li> <li>Seek opportunities: If you are moving to a new place, find opportunities to meet your neighbors, other parents in school or attend local sports or cultural events. Join a club, class, religious groups or community organizations that match your interests.</li> <li>Develop strong relationships with people you know: Getting closer and strengthening bonds with people also comes with efforts such as keeping in touch often, inviting them over, visiting them, listening to them and offering help.</li> <li>Get support: Asking for help and seeking support when you need is also important. Talk to a professional, priest or colleague when you are overwhelmed or have concerns which you cannot share with immediate family members.</li> <li>Contribute and share your skills: Volunteering to help and sharing your skills with others can be very rewarding and also provide opportunity to connect and work with others.</li> <li>Set goals: When life is busy with other commitments, schedule time for social connections and opportunities. Setting simple, specific and realistic goals that are achievable such as, &#x201C;I shall talk to one person every day or invite one friend monthly&#x201D; will be a good beginning and set you up for success.</li> </ol> <p>You can do your part in expanding your diverse set of social connections and focus on meaningful and close relationships for personal well-being. That said, it is also equally important for institutions and organizations to put equitable policies in place that help build inclusive, supportive communities and also identify those who are isolated, at-risk and need support such as supporting the vulnerable through home visits and providing social and recreational opportunities reflecting diverse cultural needs.</p>
