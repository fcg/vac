<p>Safety plays an important role in determining where you will decide to live. Just as you would do before traveling to a new destination, it is important to do your research into safety and security when considering <a href="https://www.canadim.com/immigrate/">immigration</a>.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>Is Canada a safe country?</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --> <!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>According to a recent report, Canada is one of the safest countries in the world. In 2021, Canada ranked as the <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/rankings/safe">4th safest country in the world</a> by U.S. News. Canada&#x2019;s high position on the index sits alongside Switzerland, Denmark, and Norway. Canada&#x2019;s ranking is 14 spots before the United Kingdom, and 34 spots ahead of the United States.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The U.S. News&#xA0;<a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/10-safest-countries-ranked-by-perception">2021 Best Countries Report</a> gave Canada a score of 96.7 out of 100 for safety. This ranking puts Canada significantly above the United States (10.8) and the United Kingdom (55.4).</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 id="h-crime-rate">Crime Rate</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --> <!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Canada&#x2019;s <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/2814/crime-in-canada/#topicHeader__wrapper">crime rate</a> is 5,856. This number is determined by taking the number of criminal incidents reported to the police per 100,000 population.&#xA0;For comparison,&#xA0;the United States reported about 400% more homicides in the same year.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>Worker Health and Safety</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --> <!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Canada upholds strict regulations that protect workers on the job. All businesses in the country have to ensure the health and safety of all employees while they are working. The federal government enforces these regulation through the&#xA0;<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/programs/health-safety.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Canada Labour Code,</a>&#xA0;which protects workers and employees rights.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>Housing</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --> <!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>When determining the safety of a country, many consider the affordability of housing. Fortunately, Canada has one of the world&#x2019;s best housing systems. Nearly 80% of residents have their housing needs met in the marketplace, with investments in affordable housing programs increasing. In the 2021 federal budget, the Canadian government allocated <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/department-finance/news/2021/04/budget-2021-investments-will-create-more-affordable-housing-for-canadians.html#:~:text=Budget%202021%20proposes%20to%20provide,affordable%20housing%20in%20short%20order.">$2.5 billion toward affordable housing</a>. Through these initiatives, the government aims at providing affordable, inclusive, and sustainable homes.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>Health and Emergency Services</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --> <!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Canada&#x2019;s healthcare system is highly regarded around the world. All Canadians, including those with permanent resident status, have access to a free family doctor and hospital services throughout the country. Canada&#x2019;s national health insurance plan ensures that all Canadians receive quality healthcare regardless of location or income.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>Perceptions of Personal Safety</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --> <!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In 2020,&#xA0;<a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/200609/dq200609a-eng.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">83%</a>&#xA0;of survey participants in Canada reported feeling safe when walking alone in their neighborhood after dark.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Canada&#x2019;s high global rankings in safety, <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/largest-mural-unveiled-in-ottawa-1.4890673" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">receptive policies towards immigration</a>, growing&#xA0;<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/news/2021/08/government-of-canada-invests-100-million-to-support-newcomers-integration.html">settlement services</a>&#xA0;and high targets should encourage newcomers to feel confident about their safety in Canada.</p>
