<p>Losing weight can be a difficult and challenging process, especially for working executives. But it doesn’t have to be. With the right approach, you can make healthy, creative, and sustainable lifestyle changes that will help you reach your weight-loss goals.</p>
<p>Here are 10 ways business executives can lose weight creatively:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h5>What you eat is what you get</h5>
</li>
</ol>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5847" src="https://thebusinessimmigrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image3-37.jpeg" alt="" width="1280" height="1509" srcset="https://thebusinessimmigrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image3-37.jpeg 1280w, https://thebusinessimmigrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image3-37-254x300.jpeg 254w, https://thebusinessimmigrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image3-37-869x1024.jpeg 869w, https://thebusinessimmigrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image3-37-768x905.jpeg 768w, https://thebusinessimmigrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image3-37-800x943.jpeg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p>This is the golden rule of losing weight. Experts estimate that weight loss generally consists of over 75% diet and  less than 25% exercise. So, if you spend 7 days a week in the gym, but are not disciplined in your diet, your weight loss goal will go nowhere.</p>
<p>Preparing your own meals can help you control portion sizes and make healthier food choices.</p>
<p>Those heavy duty carbohydrate-loaded lunches you buy or pack, should not be your portion if you want to lose weight creatively.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h5>Make time for exercise</h5>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Set aside time in your schedule for regular exercise, whether it&#8217;s in the morning, during lunch, or after work. Find an activity you enjoy, whether it&#8217;s running, walking, cycling, or yoga, and make it a regular part of your routine.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h5>Get enough sleep</h5>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Lack of sleep can lead to weight gain and decreased productivity. Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep per night to help promote weight loss and improve overall health.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h5>Shed weight  as you go</h5>
</li>
</ol>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5846" src="https://thebusinessimmigrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image5-26.jpeg" alt="" width="1280" height="1920" srcset="https://thebusinessimmigrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image5-26.jpeg 1280w, https://thebusinessimmigrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image5-26-200x300.jpeg 200w, https://thebusinessimmigrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image5-26-683x1024.jpeg 683w, https://thebusinessimmigrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image5-26-768x1152.jpeg 768w, https://thebusinessimmigrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image5-26-1024x1536.jpeg 1024w, https://thebusinessimmigrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image5-26-800x1200.jpeg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p>Incorporate <span style="color: #3366ff;"><a style="color: #3366ff;" href="https://thebusinessimmigrant.com/7-affordable-hobbies-that-can-help-you-live-longer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">physical activity</a></span> into your daily routine, so you shed weight as you go about your executive day.</p>
<p>Instead of sitting in meetings all day, try standing meetings or walking meetings. Take the stairs instead of the elevator, and park further away from the office to get in some extra steps.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h5>Avoid emotional eating</h5>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Emotional eating can lead to overeating and weight gain. Try to identify and address the underlying emotional issues that may be causing you to eat when you&#8217;re not hungry</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<h5>Practice mindfulness and mindful eating</h5>
</li>
</ol>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-5845 size-full" src="https://thebusinessimmigrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image6-13.jpeg" alt="How business executives can lose weight creatively " width="1280" height="1917" srcset="https://thebusinessimmigrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image6-13.jpeg 1280w, https://thebusinessimmigrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image6-13-200x300.jpeg 200w, https://thebusinessimmigrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image6-13-684x1024.jpeg 684w, https://thebusinessimmigrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image6-13-768x1150.jpeg 768w, https://thebusinessimmigrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image6-13-1026x1536.jpeg 1026w, https://thebusinessimmigrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image6-13-800x1198.jpeg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p>Mindfulness techniques, such as deep breathing and meditation, can help you become more aware of your body&#8217;s hunger and fullness signals, leading to healthier eating habits.</p>
<p>Be aware of what you&#8217;re eating and when, and try to avoid eating out of boredom or stress.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>
<h5>Minimize stress</h5>
</li>
</ol>
<p>High levels of stress can lead to overeating and weight gain. Take time to relax and practice stress-reducing techniques such as meditation or yoga.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>
<h5>Drink water</h5>
</li>
</ol>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5844" src="https://thebusinessimmigrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image5-27.jpeg" alt="" width="1280" height="1600" srcset="https://thebusinessimmigrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image5-27.jpeg 1280w, https://thebusinessimmigrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image5-27-240x300.jpeg 240w, https://thebusinessimmigrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image5-27-819x1024.jpeg 819w, https://thebusinessimmigrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image5-27-768x960.jpeg 768w, https://thebusinessimmigrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image5-27-1229x1536.jpeg 1229w, https://thebusinessimmigrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image5-27-800x1000.jpeg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p>Staying hydrated can help you feel full and eat less. Aim for at least 8 glasses of water per day.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>
<h5>Find a workout buddy</h5>
</li>
</ol>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-5843 size-full" src="https://thebusinessimmigrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image2-58.jpeg" alt="How business executives can lose weight creatively " width="1280" height="854" srcset="https://thebusinessimmigrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image2-58.jpeg 1280w, https://thebusinessimmigrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image2-58-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://thebusinessimmigrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image2-58-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://thebusinessimmigrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image2-58-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://thebusinessimmigrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image2-58-800x534.jpeg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p>Having someone to exercise with can help you stay motivated and on track with <span style="color: #3366ff;"><a style="color: #3366ff;" href="https://thebusinessimmigrant.com/9-best-home-exercises-for-immigrant-womens-healthy-living/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">your weight loss goals</a></span>.</p>

<p>Setting unrealistic weight loss goals can lead to disappointment and discouragement. Instead, set small, <span style="color: #3366ff;"><a style="color: #3366ff;" href="https://thebusinessimmigrant.com/how-to-achieve-your-most-ambitious-goals-by-thinking-big/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">achievable goals</a></span> that you can work towards.</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>
<h5>Be patient</h5>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Weight loss is a journey, not a destination. It takes time and consistency to see results.</p>
<p>Be patient with yourself and don&#8217;t give up if you don&#8217;t see results right away. It’s like running your business. Overnight success is not often a dream come true.</p>
<p>“Don’t push it, don’t force it. Let it happen naturally.” That classic oldie song still rings true today for business executives who want to lose weight creatively.</p>

<p>According to the report, Toronto and Montreal are the main hubs of auto thefts in Canada. Those behind the annual study say crime rings are stealing an increasing number of vehicles with the goal of exporting them internationally.</p>
<p>Montreal is the “principal” shipment port for <span style="color: #3366ff;"><a style="color: #3366ff;" href="https://thebusinessimmigrant.com/the-top-5-most-stolen-vehicles-in-canada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stolen vehicles</a></span>. “Not only does auto theft cost Canadians millions of dollars each year, the proceeds of this illegal activity also fund organized crime and terrorism, both domestically and internationally,” Bryan Gast, vice-president of investigative services at Équité Association, said in a news release.</p>
<p>Car thieves are finding a way to get around anti-theft technology. They do so through relay attacks, also known as keyless thefts, which use devices to amplify the signal emitted from a key fob inside a home, allowing them to start the vehicle’s engine.</p>
<p>Another tactic is cloning a vehicle&#8217;s key using an on-board diagnostic port.</p>
<p>Still looking to buy a new vehicle? The thieves are looking too.  Now you know!</p>

<p>Elon Musk has officially broken the world record for the largest loss of personal fortune in history.</p>
<p>Musk’s net worth dropped from a peak of $320 billion in 2021 to $138 billion as of January 2023, largely due to the <span style="color: #3366ff;"><a style="color: #3366ff;" href="https://thebusinessimmigrant.com/3-reasons-to-buy-or-not-buy-tesla-stock-split-shares/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poor performance of Tesla’s stock</a></span>.</p>
<p><span style="color: #3366ff;"><a style="color: #3366ff;" href="https://thebusinessimmigrant.com/is-elon-musk-manipulating-the-stock-market-in-latest-twitter-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Musk’s total losses</a></span> far surpass the previous record of $58.6 billion, set by Japanese tech investor Masayoshi Son in 2000.</p>
<p>“Long-term fundamentals are extremely strong. Short-term market madness is unpredictable,” Musk tweeted after the market closed for the year on 30 December 2022.</p>
<p>Musk&#8217;s misfortunes also saw him lose his status as the world’s richest person to Bernard Arnault (France), founder of luxury goods conglomerate LVMH (Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy), who has an estimated net worth of $190 billion.</p>
<p>The tumultuous takeover, coupled with Musk’s polarizing behaviour on the platform, sparked the biggest Tesla stock sell-off since the company went public in 2010.</p>
<p>Despite the plunge in prosperity, Tesla remains the most valuable car company in the world, with a market cap over $100 billion larger than their closest competitor, Toyota.</p>
<h5>Don’t cry for me!</h5>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5826" src="https://thebusinessimmigrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image1-5.png" alt="Elon Musk sets Guinness World Record for worst loss of fortune in human history" width="1920" height="1721" srcset="https://thebusinessimmigrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image1-5.png 1920w, https://thebusinessimmigrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image1-5-300x269.png 300w, https://thebusinessimmigrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image1-5-1024x918.png 1024w, https://thebusinessimmigrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image1-5-768x688.png 768w, https://thebusinessimmigrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image1-5-1536x1377.png 1536w, https://thebusinessimmigrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image1-5-800x717.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<p>So, if you’ve recently lost some business accounts or a few thousand dollars, don’t worry. Just think of how much Musk has lost.</p>
<p>Elon Musk is not losing any sleep either or afraid of going hungry any time soon &#8211; he’s still the world’s second-richest person.</p>

<p>The cuts amount to around 6% of the firm&#8217;s roughly 300,000-strong corporate workforce.</p>
<p>Amazon is the latest big technology company to unveil major layoffs as the cost of living crisis sees customers cut back on spending.</p>
<p>The announcement comes after the technology giant said last year that it would reduce its headcount.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are working to support those who are affected and are providing packages that include a separation payment, transitional health insurance benefits, and external job placement support,&#8221; Mr Jassy said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Amazon has weathered uncertain and difficult economies in the past, and we will continue to do so,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Amazon had earlier  a hiring freeze and halted some of its warehouse expansions, warning it had over-hired during the pandemic.</p>
<p>It has also taken steps to shut some parts of its business, cancelling projects such as a personal delivery robot.</p>
<p>Prior to the pandemic, tech companies would often remove only the bottom 1% to 3% of their workforce. But <span style="color: #3366ff;"><a style="color: #3366ff;" href="https://thebusinessimmigrant.com/wealthsimple-joins-netflix-and-crypto-firms-in-laying-off-staff-in-a-bloody-stock-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">job cuts are now across board</a></span>.  Amazon will face &#8220;more pain ahead&#8221; as customers tighten their belts.</p>

<p>If you are a landlord or own an investment property in Toronto, you need to declare the vacancy status of your property immediately. If not, you would soon be sent a hefty Vacant Home Tax bill.</p>
<p>The <span style="color: #3366ff;"><a style="color: #3366ff;" href="https://thebusinessimmigrant.com/this-is-the-best-time-to-buy-a-house-in-toronto-as-house-prices-drop-by-almost-20/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">City of Toronto</a></span> has implemented a Vacant Home Tax on all vacant residential properties and has sent letters and notices to all landlords.</p>
<p>All Toronto residential property owners must submit a declaration of their property’s 2022 occupancy status by February 2, 2023.</p>
<p>Owners who fail to make a declaration by the due date will be subject to pay the Vacant Home Tax, at a rate of 1% of the property’s 2022 Current Val Assessment (CVA). For example, the tax on a $1 million home will be $10,000. There is a $250 fine for late submissions.</p>
<p>A property is considered vacant if it is not used as the principal residence by the owner(s) or any permitted tenant / occupant(s), or if it was unoccupied for a total of six months or more during the previous calendar year.</p>
<p>The goal of the City of Toronto’s Vacant Home Tax (VHT) is to increase the supply of housing by discouraging owners from leaving their residential properties unoccupied. Homeowners who choose to keep their properties vacant will be subject to this tax.</p>

<p>The company had also earlier announced plans to split its brands into two publicly traded companies with Old Navy falling into one business and Gap, Banana Republic, Athleta, Intermix and Hill City making up another.</p>
<p>The fear in retail fashion circles is that Old Navy and Banana Republic  may soon fall under the hammer as well.</p>
<p>A Gap spokesperson previously explained: “As part of our company strategy to adapt to the changing needs of our customer and growth of our online business,  we are looking thoughtfully at our real estate to support the best path forward.</p>
<p>As a result, we are closing  a number of stores across Canada.  We remain committed to making appropriate and timely decisions on stores that  don’t fit our vision for the future of Gap Inc. We are confident these closures will help strengthen the health of our company moving forward.”</p>
<p>There are 80 Gap retail stores in Canada as of November 04, 2022.</p>
<h4>What happened to Gap and why is it closing down?</h4>

<p>Gap used to be one of the world’s hottest retail brands, but time has caught up with the retail giant and it has lost its shine. What happened to Gap? Here are five reasons why Gap is closing down:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h5>Fashion oversight</h5>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A series of fashion misses and failure to quickly anticipate retail trends and catch up with the young market. This is the biggest reason why Gap is closing down in Canada</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h5>High prices</h5>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The quality of Gap clothings was unquestionable, but <span style="color: #3366ff;"><a style="color: #3366ff;" href="https://thebusinessimmigrant.com/how-to-save-money-as-an-international-student-in-canada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it’s high prices got buyers running for cover</a></span>. It led to Gap closing down</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h5>Inflation</h5>
</li>
</ol>
<p>With consumers feeling the inflation squeeze, the Gap fell out of the radar and was forced to close most of its high-end stores.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h5>Hot competition</h5>
</li>
</ol>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-5754 aligncenter" src="https://thebusinessimmigrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image3-34.jpeg" alt="" width="1280" height="1920" srcset="https://thebusinessimmigrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image3-34.jpeg 1280w, https://thebusinessimmigrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image3-34-200x300.jpeg 200w, https://thebusinessimmigrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image3-34-683x1024.jpeg 683w, https://thebusinessimmigrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image3-34-768x1152.jpeg 768w, https://thebusinessimmigrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image3-34-1024x1536.jpeg 1024w, https://thebusinessimmigrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image3-34-800x1200.jpeg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p>The shift in consumer demand resulted in shoppers turning away from Gap to fast fashion rivals such as H&amp;M, Zara, Forever 21, Marshals and Winners. This is probably the biggest reason why Gap is closing down in Canada.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<h5>Business strategy direction</h5>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The Gap is changing its business model from brick and mortar stores to online shopping</p>
<h4>Gap closure and shoppers’ delight</h4>

<p>While the Gap is counting its losses, Canadians and immigrant shoppers are snapping up jaw- <span style="color: #3366ff;"><a style="color: #3366ff;" href="https://thebusinessimmigrant.com/7-things-you-should-not-buy-on-black-friday/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropping Seasonal and New Year bargains</a></span> at the Gap store in Toronto.</p>
<p>Sadness and joy can sometimes happen together.</p>

<p>Highly-skilled professionals planning to immigrate to Canada are now getting their applications processed faster than ever before.</p>
<p>Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) has been taking steady action to strengthen Canada’s immigration system—reducing wait times, and modernizing its services so they work better for everyone</p>
<p>Today, Canada’s Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship, the Honourable Sean Fraser, highlighted progress that has been made this year, in reducing backlogs of applications that have been in IRCC’s inventories beyond its service standards.</p>
<h5>Record year for processing immigration applications to Canada</h5>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5743" src="https://thebusinessimmigrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image0-2022-12-20T082032.379.jpeg" alt="Canada reduces immigration backlog of applications by 500,000" width="1280" height="856" srcset="https://thebusinessimmigrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image0-2022-12-20T082032.379.jpeg 1280w, https://thebusinessimmigrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image0-2022-12-20T082032.379-300x201.jpeg 300w, https://thebusinessimmigrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image0-2022-12-20T082032.379-1024x685.jpeg 1024w, https://thebusinessimmigrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image0-2022-12-20T082032.379-768x514.jpeg 768w, https://thebusinessimmigrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image0-2022-12-20T082032.379-800x535.jpeg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p>Since August, IRCC has reduced its overall inventory by nearly half a million applications. The department has also been setting the bar higher  for processing.</p>
<p>At the end of November, IRCC had processed approximately 4.8 million applications—nearly twice the 2.5 million processed during the same period last year.</p>
<p>To help strengthen our immigration system, IRCC has digitized applications, hired and trained new employees, streamlined processes, and harnessed automation technologies to increase processing efficiency while protecting the safety and security of Canadians.</p>
<p>The department remains on track to meet its goal to process 80% of new applications within service standards for most programs and continues to make strides in improving processing, resulting in shorter wait times for our clients.</p>
<p>For study permit processing, Canada is also on pace to set a new record this year. As of November 30 this year, IRCC had processed over 670,000 study permits, compared to more than 500,000 during the same time period last year. As a result of these efforts, most new study permits are now being processed within the 60-day service standard.</p>
<p>Work permit processing also saw vast improvements, with nearly 700,000 work permits processed by November 30, compared to about 223,000 during the same period in 2019, before the pandemic.</p>
<p>IRCC continues to reduce backlogs and process visitor visas more quickly to respond to the growing number of people who want to visit Canada.</p>
<p>On a monthly basis, Canada is now processing more visitor visa applications than it did prior to the pandemic. In November alone, over 260,000 visitor visas were processed. By contrast, the monthly average in 2019 was about 180,000 applications.</p>
<h6>Permanent residents to Canada.</h6>
<p><span style="color: #3366ff;"><a style="color: #3366ff;" href="https://thebusinessimmigrant.com/canada-immigration-increases-permanent-residence-fees/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Permanent residence applications</a></span>, improving service and reuniting spouses and families are also being processed faster.</p>
<p>Canada welcomed a <span style="color: #3366ff;"><a style="color: #3366ff;" href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/news/2021/12/canada-welcomes-the-most-immigrants-in-a-single-year-in-its-history.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">record-breaking 405,000 new permanent residents</a></span> in 2021, surpassing the previous record from 1913. After another record year in 2022, Canada remains on track to reach its target of more than 431,000 new permanent residents.</p>
<p>All new spousal sponsorship applications are now processed within the pre-pandemic service standard of 12 months and new Express Entry applications within 6 months.</p>
<p>Permanent residents can also expect shorter wait times when renewing their permanent resident cards as IRCC has reduced its pandemic backlog of applications for card renewals by 99%.</p>
<p>Canada is proud to have one of the highest naturalization rates in the world and encourages all newcomers to complete their journey by becoming Canadian citizens. IRCC expects a record number of new Canadian citizens in 2022–2023, with approximately 251,000 new citizens welcomed from April to November—surpassing the total number of new Canadian citizens for the last fiscal year.</p>
<p>The Honourable Sean Fraser, Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship said, “our actions are ensuring that we can continue to welcome and support newcomers who come to Canada to work, study, visit, or settle here.</p>
<p>“It is through the dedication and hard work of those who administer our immigration system, and our willingness to modernize and adapt, that we are able to uphold Canada’s reputation as a welcoming and inclusive country.”</p>

<p>Canadians looking to escape the winter and work in Spain or other European country now have a chance to do so, as Spain rolls out its Nomad Visa.</p>
<p>Capitalizing on the enormous rise in post-pandemic remote work, Spain has announced a new visa program that will allow non–European Economic Area residents (including British, US and Canadian citizens) working for foreign companies to live in the country without having to obtain a full work visa.</p>
<p>The Ley de Startups (Startups Law), which aims to attract tech companies, remote workers and digital nomads to Spain, is expected to come into force in January 2023.</p>
<p>This will open a new <span style="color: #3366ff;"><a style="color: #3366ff;" href="https://thebusinessimmigrant.com/immigrating-to-canada-use-an-immigration-lawyer-or-go-on-your-own/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">migration route for foreign workers</a></span> who might fancy a move to the country, including digital nomads. While it doesn’t carry this particular name, the new regulation is, in effect, an equivalent to a Digital Nomad Visa (DNV)</p>
<p>The visa will initially be valid for one year, with the possibility of extending it afterward for up to five years. To be eligible, you must be employed by a non-Spanish company operating outside Spain, or, if self-employed, earn no more than 20% of your income from Spanish clients.</p>
<p>There will be a minimum monthly income requirement and applicants will need to show some kind of proof of accommodation. Additionally, private health insurance and a higher-education qualification or three years’ worth of work experience are likely to be other prerequisites. Visa holders will benefit from substantial non-resident tax breaks (exact figures are still to come), and have the option to bring along close family members.</p>
<p>Does a life in Spain sound enticing? As you wait the release of all the program’s details, start dreaming in the meantime of the perfect place to live.</p>
<h5>Top destination in Spain for working remotely</h5>

<p>Some of the top destinations to consider when moving to Spain are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Valencia</strong>, an often overlooked coastal gem with a growing population of American and British expats</li>
<li><strong>Gran Canaria and Tenerife</strong>, two ‘workcation’ hubs in the Canaries that have <span style="color: #3366ff;"><a style="color: #3366ff;" href="https://www.traveloffpath.com/airbnb-partners-with-this-beautiful-sunny-destination-to-attract-digital-nomads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partnered with AirBnB</a></span> recently to attract more digital nomads</li>
<li><strong>Barcelona</strong>, the historical capital of the autonomous Catalonia, where <em>La Sagrada Familia</em> and countless works by Gaudi can be found</li>
<li><strong>Seville</strong>, the largest city in Andalusia and one of Spain’s most culturally-charged, home to La Giralda and the landmark Plaza de Espana</li>
<li><strong>Formentera</strong>, the smaller of the Balearic islands and Ibiza’s smaller, southern neighbor, packed with marine parks and pristine beaches</li>
<li><strong>Bilbao</strong>, a vibrant metropolis in Northern Spain, more specifically Basque Country, famous for its world-class museums and colorful Old Quartet</li>
</ul>
<p>Joining video calls from a sun-drenched terrace. Spending weekends kicking back by the Mediterranean or hiking through rugged hills. Sound tempting yet? Spain’s much-anticipated new digital-nomad visa could be just the ticket.</p>

<p>Indonesia has now made sex outside marriage a crime. Unmarried couples and Canadian tourists planning a holiday trip to Indonesia may have to think again.</p>
<p>Indonesia’s parliament has just passed the new law that  bans sex outside marriage with a punishment of up to one year in jail, despite worries the laws may scare away tourists from its shores and harm investment.</p>
<p>Lawmakers approved a new criminal code which will apply to Indonesians and foreigners alike. It will also ban insulting the president or state institutions, spreading views counter to the state ideology, and staging protests without notification.</p>
<p>Sex outside of marriage can be punished with up to a one-year prison term; living with someone who isn’t your spouse can lead to six months. Charges must be based on police reports filed by parents, children or spouses.</p>
<p>However, the code will not come into effect for three years to allow for implementing regulations to be drafted.</p>
<p>Currently, Indonesia bans adultery but not premarital sex.</p>
<p>Maulana Yusran, deputy chief of Indonesia&#8217;s tourism industry board, said the new code was &#8220;totally counter-productive&#8221; at a time when the economy and tourism were starting to recover from the pandemic.</p>
<p>We deeply regret the government have closed their eyes. We have already expressed our concern to the ministry of tourism about how harmful this law is,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The world’s largest Muslim-majority nation, Indonesia has seen a rise in religious conservatism in recent years. Strict Islamic laws are already enforced in parts of the country, including the semi-autonomous Aceh province, where alcohol and gambling are banned. Public floggings also take place in the region for a range of offenses including homosexuality and adultery.</p>
<p>Foreign arrivals in the holiday destination of Bali are expected to reach pre-pandemic levels of six million by 2025, the tourism association has said previously, as the island recovers from the impacts of COVID-19. Indonesia is also trying to attract more so-called &#8220;digital nomads&#8221; to its tropical shores by offering a more flexible visa.</p>
<h5>What the new sex law means to Canadians</h5>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-5726 size-full" src="https://thebusinessimmigrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image1-96.jpeg" alt="Sex outside marriage is now a crime in Indonesia- what it means for Canadians" width="1920" height="1280" srcset="https://thebusinessimmigrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image1-96.jpeg 1920w, https://thebusinessimmigrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image1-96-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://thebusinessimmigrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image1-96-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://thebusinessimmigrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image1-96-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://thebusinessimmigrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image1-96-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://thebusinessimmigrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image1-96-800x533.jpeg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<p>Canada and Indonesia share a long-standing partnership of over 65 years. Since 2000, Canada has provided  over $1 billion in official development assistance (ODA) to Indonesia with an average of  $44 million (all channels combined) per year over the past 5 years. Bilateral funding to Indonesia in the fiscal year 2021 to 2022 was approximately $13.5 million.</p>
<p>Tourism is a vital part of Indonesia’s economy and the World Bank reported that over 4 million tourists visited Indonesia in 2020.</p>
<p>The ambiguity of the new criminal code and how it will be enforced leaves foreigners in a gray zone. Because charges of adultery or cohabitation can only be filed by close relatives, law-breaking tourists might go undetected. Moreover, reporting foreigners goes against the interests of Western-style hotels in vacation destinations like Bali, which rely on tourist dollars to stay afloat.</p>
<p>But for singles looking to mingle or unwed couples hoping for a romantic escape to the gorgeous Indonesia beaches, possible jail time isn’t synonymous with “a paradise vacation.” Unless Indonesia relaxes the laws, travelers must consider if the risk is worth the reward.</p>

<p>If you are planning to buy a house in Canada, your mortgage qualifying rate will now be over 8%. The Bank of Canada’s most recent interest rate hike may force homebuyers to prove they can pay mortgages with interest rates above 8%.</p>
<p>This will be a severe blow to prospective house buyers and another headwind for the country’s cooling housing market.</p>
<p>Canadian regulators require that buyers pass a “stress test” showing that they can afford mortgages with rates that are two percentage points higher than lenders are offering.</p>
<p>Major banks’ variable mortgage rates are close to their prime lending rates, which in turn are 2.2 points above the <span style="color: #3366ff;"><a style="color: #3366ff;" href="https://thebusinessimmigrant.com/looking-for-a-bank-job-in-canada-check-out-this-complete-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bank of Canada</a></span>’s overnight rate.</p>
<p>The central bank on Wednesday announced a 4.25% interest rate as it continues its campaign to quell inflation. That will push the commercial-bank prime rate to 6.45% — about double where it was in April.</p>
<h5>The economics and emotions of interest rates</h5>

<p>Currently, major banks such as  TD Bank and RBC have posted mortgage rates slightly below prime — though top customers may be given bigger discounts. In other words, advertised variable mortgage rates are likely to move to the low 6% range, pushing the stress-test rate to more than 8%.</p>
<p>Consumers may be able to get a slightly lower rate if they agree to lock in for five years. <span style="color: #3366ff;"><a style="color: #3366ff;" href="https://thebusinessimmigrant.com/rbc-to-buy-up-hsbc-canadawhat-it-means-to-immigrants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RBC’s  five-year</a></span> fixed mortgage is at 5.7% and tends to track the yield on benchmark government bonds, not the Bank of Canada policy rate.</p>
<p><span style="color: #3366ff;"><a style="color: #3366ff;" href="https://thebusinessimmigrant.com/interest-rates-jump-higher-and-canadas-house-prices-stay-lower/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Home prices in Canada</a></span> already have fallen 10% from their February peak, with previously hot markets including Toronto and its surrounding area posting steeper declines.</p>
<p>The  available houses for sale have dropped even more, as sellers cling to hopes that prices will rebound — or remain hesitant to move and take on new mortgages at today’s higher rates.</p>
<p>Shahab Shahisavandi, a mortgage agent at Dominion Lending Centres Edge, counseled that “despite the sudden spike in interest rates and the disruption to the housing market, home owners should stay calm and take a long -term view. For first-time home buyers, early preparation is the key success factor.”</p>
