<description><![CDATA[A shortage of skilled workers in the electricity sector could jeopardize Canada’s ability to develop clean sources of energy. Over the next 10 years, 40% of all workers in the electricity sector plan to retire and 74% of the industry’s workers are over the age of 40. According to Canada’s Electricity Sector Council, more than 30% of companies that produce electricity do not have plans to manage this mass departure of workers. This will result in construction schedule delays, increased development costs, and smaller profit margins unless Canada is able to attract skilled workers from abroad.<br

<description><![CDATA[A new report from the Conference Board of Canada recommends that Canadian immigration policies should continue to evolve to prevent labour shortages that could stunt future economic growth. To accomplish this, the report states that Canadian immigration policy should place more importance on the skills of prospective immigrants and whether they match Canada's labour needs. This will be increasingly important because steady job growth tends to be the norm in Canada and Canada’s large baby-boomer generation is approaching retirement age.<br
