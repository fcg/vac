Express Entry：如何获得综合排名系统的高分 只有得分最高的候选人才会被 IRCC 邀请移民加拿大。	Express Entry: How to get a high Comprehensive Ranking System score  Only the highest scoring candidates are invited by IRCC to immigrate to Canada.
	
综合排名系统（CRS）用于对希望通过快速通道移民加拿大的技术工人候选人进行排名。 Express Entry 是管理加拿大移民难民和公民身份 (IRCC) 申请的系统，是加拿大政府欢迎经济类移民的主要方式。	The Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) is used to rank skilled worker candidates who want to immigrate to Canada through Express Entry. Express Entry is a system that manages applications by Immigration Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) and is the main way the Canadian government welcomes economic class immigrants.
	
Express Entry 管理三个独立的项目：联邦技术工人项目 (FSWP)、联邦技术贸易项目 (FSTP) 和加拿大经验类项目 (CEC)。这三个项目中的每一个都有候选人在有资格申请之前必须满足的资格标准。	Express Entry manages three separate programs: the Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP), the Federal Skilled Trades Program (FSTP) and the Canadian Experience Class (CEC). Each of the three programs have eligibility criteria that a candidate must meet before being eligible to apply.
	
如果符合条件，候选人将收到 CRS 的分数。该分数基于各种特征，例如年龄、教育程度、语言技能和工作经验。	If eligible, the candidate will receive a score by the CRS. The score is based on various characteristics such as age, education, language skills and work experience.
	
CRS 用于确定最有可能在加拿大就业市场取得成功的候选人。联邦政府的研究表明，具有高水平工作经验、教育和语言技能的中青年新移民最能融入加拿大的劳动力市场。	The CRS is used to identify candidates that will have the best chance succeeding in Canada’s job market. The federal government research has shown that new immigrations that are young to middle aged, with high levels of work experience, education and language skills are most able to integrate into Canada’s labour market.
	
CRS包含三个因素：	The CRS contains three factors:
	
* 核心人力资本因素	  Core Human Capital Factors
* 技能可转移性因素	  Skills Transferability Factors
* 其他因素	  Additional factors
	
CRS 下共有 1,200 点可用。	There is a total of 1,200 points available under the CRS.
	
对于没有随行配偶或同居伴侣的候选人，有：	For candidates without an accompanying spouse or common law partner, there are:
	
* 核心人力资本因素最多可得500分；	  A maximum of 500 points available for core human capital factors;
* 技能可迁移性因素最高 100 分；和	  A maximum of 100 points for skill transferability factors; and
* 600 分可用于其他因素。	  600 points available for additional factors.
	
对于有随行配偶或同居伴侣的候选人，有	For candidates with an accompanying spouse or common law partner, there are
	
* 主申请人核心人力资本因素最高可得460分；	  A maximum of 460 points available for core human capital factors of the principal applicant;
* 配偶或同居伴侣的核心人力资本因素最高40分；	  A maximum of 40 points for the core human capital factors of the spouse or common-law partner;
* 技能可迁移性因素最多可获得 100 分；和	  A maximum of 100 points available for skill transferability factors; and
* 600 分可用于其他因素。	  600 points available for additional factors.
	
候选人也可能因法语能力而获得分数，如果他们在加拿大有兄弟姐妹是加拿大公民或永久居民。	A candidate may also get points for French speaking ability and if they have a sibling in Canada is who is a Canadian citizen or permanent resident.
	
### 核心人力资本因素	Core Human Capital Factors
	
核心人力资本因素包括年龄、教育水平、第一语言能力、第二语言能力和加拿大工作经验。	Core human capital factors include age, level of education, first language ability, second language ability and Canadian work experience.
	
例如，年龄是影响较大的因素之一。如果您在 20-29 岁之间申请，您将自动获得 110 CRS 积分。	For example, age is one of the more influential factors. If you apply between the ages of 20-29, you will automatically receive 110 CRS points.
	
### 技能转移因素	Skill Transferability Factors
	
在此类别下，候选人的技能可转移性因素最多可获得 100 分。技能可迁移性有五种组合，每种组合最高50分。他们包括：	Under this category, a maximum of 100 points are given for a candidate’s skill transferability factors. There are five combinations of skill transferability, with a maximum of 50 points for each combination. They include:
	
* 教育和加拿大工作经验	  Education and Canadian work experience
* 教育和语言能力	  Education and language ability
* 语言能力和非加拿大工作经验	  Language ability and non-Canadian work experience
* 加拿大和非加拿大工作经验	  Canadian and non-Canadian work experience
* 行业资格证书和语言能力	  Certificate of qualification in a trade and language ability
	
### 其他因素	Additional Factors
	
在附加因素类别下，如果候选人拥有加拿大省份（不包括魁北克省）的增强提名证书，则可以获得额外的600分。这基本上确保了在即将到来的快速通道抽签中申请的邀请。	Under the additional factors category, candidates can get an extra 600 points if they have an enhanced nomination certificate from a Canadian province (excluding Quebec). This essentially ensures an invitation to apply in an upcoming Express Entry draw.
	
在这一类别中增加 CRS 分数的其他因素包括从加拿大雇主那里获得合格的工作机会或安排的工作、完成加拿大的学习经历、证明足够的法语和英语能力以及在加拿大有兄弟姐妹。	Other factors that increase CRS scores in this category include having a qualifying job offer or arranged employment from a Canadian employer, completing a Canadian study experience, proving adequate French and English ability, and having a sibling in Canada.
	
### 如何提高你的 CRS 分数	How to improve your CRS score
	
语言是一个很有价值的因素，当与其他因素结合时，最高可获得 310 CRS 点数，如果申请人已婚或处于同居关系中，则最高可达 320 点。由于候选人可以获得高于最低要求的语言能力，因此这是提高分数的好方法。	Language is valuable factor than can be worth up to 310 CRS points when combined with other factors and up to 320 if the applicant is married or in a common law relationship. Since a candidate can gain language abilities for being above the minimal requirements, it is a great way to improve a score.
	
此外，语言是一项宝贵的资产，因为它在 CRS 的几个部分中都占分，包括人力资本因素、配偶因素、技能可转移性因素和其他因素类别。	In addition, language is a valuable asset because it counts for points in several sections of the CRS, including the human capital factors, the spousal factors, the skill transferability factors and the additional factors categories.
	
教育是提高 CRS 分数的另一种方式，因为它最多可以计入 250 CRS 分数。候选人可以通过完成学位或获得现有学位的额外教育证书评估 (ECA) 来提高他们的教育分数。	Education is another way to increase a CRS score because it can count for up to 250 CRS points. A candidate can improve their education score by completing a degree or by obtaining additional Education Credential Assessment (ECAs) for existing degrees.
	
获得额外的工作经验或更好地记录工作经验可能是提高 CRS 分数的一种方式。拥有看似不熟练的职位的候选人可能实际上履行了加拿大国家职业分类 (NOC) 中被视为技能的职责，并最终可以提高分数。	Obtaining additional work experience or better documenting work experience can be a way to increase a CRS score. Candidates who may have a job title that seems unskilled may have actually performed duties that are considered skills under Canada’s National Occupation Classification (NOC) and can ultimately increase a score.
	
此外，候选人可能想考虑他们的配偶或同居伴侣是否是更好的主申请人。主申请人的 CRS 分数可能低于其伴侣的分数，因此让夫妻比较 CRS 分数是有益的。	In addition, a candidate may want to consider if their spouse or common law partner would be a better principal applicant. It could be possible that a principal applicant’s CRS score may be lower than that of their partner, so it would be beneficial to have couples compare CRS scores.
	
最后，被加拿大省提名永久居留的快速通道候选人可以获得额外的 600 分，以获得他们的 CRS 分数。	Finally, Express Entry candidates that have been nominated by a Canadian province for permanent residence can be awarded an additional 600 points towards their CRS score.
	
### 你应该以低分进入游泳池吗？	Should you enter the pool with a low score?
	
如果您符合条件，进入快速通道池是有益的，因为它会增加您成功移民加拿大的机会。进入游泳池也是免费的。	Entering the Express Entry pool if you are eligible is beneficial because it increases your chances of successfully immigrating to Canada. It is also free to enter the pool.
	
此外，CRS 截止分数总是在波动，因此如果您认为自己的分数较低，最终可能足以获得申请永久居留权的邀请。此外，在池中，您可以通过上述方式努力提高分数，例如获得更多符合条件的专业工作经验或重新参加语言测试。	In addition, CRS cut off scores are always fluctuating and so if you think your score is low, it may eventually be enough to secure an invitation to apply for permanent residence. In addition, while in the pool, you can work on improving your score by the means explained above, such as gaining more eligible professional work experience or retaking the language test.
	
此外，在池中，您可能会获得申请省提名的邀请，或者您可能会收到一份加拿大工作机会，这可能会给您足够高的分数以获得永久居留的 ITA。	Furthermore, while in the pool, you may obtain an invitation to apply for provincial nomination or you could receive a Canadian job offer, which may give you a high enough score to obtain an ITA for permanent residence.
