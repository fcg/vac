加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 以拥有世界移民部门中最广泛的移民计划之一而自豪。其 100 多个移民签证类别和项目迎合了为工作、学校/教育、生活机会、健康/医疗、旅行和旅游而移居加拿大的潜在移民。	Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) prides itself on having one of the most prodigiously extensive immigration program offerings among the world’s immigration departments. Its over 100 immigration visa streams and programs cater to prospective immigrants to Canada who move for the purposes of work, school/education, life opportunity, health/medical, travel and tourism.
	
它甚至为希望与其家属（即配偶/伴侣和家人/子女）移居加拿大的人提供签证赞助计划。最近，作为利用加拿大政府加大力度增加该国经济机会和竞争力的一种手段，IRCC 制定了新的投资者/创业计划，试图吸引有才华的商人到该国。	It even has visa sponsorship programs for people who wish to move to Canada with their dependents i.e. spouse/partner and family/children. Most recently as a means of capitalizing on the Canadian government's intensified efforts to increase the country’s economic opportunities and competitiveness, the IRCC has created new investor/entrepreneurship programs to try to attract talented business people to the country.

加拿大一直在攀升，成为世界上最具经济竞争力的国家之一。与纽约、墨西哥城和圣保罗一起，其旗舰城市多伦多是美洲主要的金融中心之一。	Canada has been climbing the ranks as one of the world's most economically competitive countries. Along with New York, Mexico City and Sao Paulo, its flagship city Toronto is one of the major financial centers of the Americas.
	
该国幅员辽阔、地形多变，蕴藏着丰富的自然资源，如页岩油、天然气、原油、煤炭和其他有价值的矿产，如金、铜、锌、铁、铀、钾盐和钻石。所有这些矿藏都数量巨大，可以在未来几年内用于经济收益。	The vast and varied topography of the country is rich in natural resources such as shale oil, natural gas, crude oil, coal and other valuable minerals such as gold, copper, zinc, iron, uranium, potash and diamonds. All of these mineral deposits are in vast quantities that can be leveraged for economic gain for years to come.
	
加拿大拥有世界上最广阔的海岸线之一，也拥有丰富的海洋财富，体现在捕鲸和渔业以及拥有大量渔获物和规模庞大的商船队。	Canada, which has one of the world’s most extensive coastlines is also rich in marine wealth, reflected in the whaling and fishing industry and its possession of vast quantities of catch and significantly sized merchant marine fleet.
	
加拿大也一直非常重视建立一个重要的产业和增加小企业的经济份额。这是承认小企业是主权经济体就业和增长的支柱，也是经济繁荣周期停滞期间防止经济崩溃的支柱。加拿大制定了法律并打破了繁文缛节，使小企业主更容易、更容易获得和获得资金。	Canada’s also been putting a lot of emphasis on building up a significant industry and increasing the economic share of small businesses. This is in recognition that small businesses are the anchors of employment and growth for sovereign economies and a buttress against economic collapse during lulls in the boom cycle of economies. Canada has instituted laws and broken red tape to make it easier and more accessible for small business owners to source and receive capital.

#### **艾伯塔省**	**Alberta**
	
艾伯塔省是创业的好地方。尽管根据经济学人智库 (EIU) 的年度排名，卡尔加里是世界上第三大最宜居城市，但阿尔伯塔省卡尔加里的农田才是您真正的投资选择所在。该省是加拿大第二大农业生产省，其多样的地貌使这片土地非常适合作物生产、畜牧业生产等。目前，艾伯塔省只有一种投资签证可供选择——农场流。	Alberta is a great place to start a business. Though it is home to the world's 3rd most liveable city according to the Economist Intelligence Unit's (EIU) annual rankings, Calgary, Alberta's farmlands are where your investment options truly lie. The province is Canada's second-largest agricultural producer, and its diverse landscapes make the land perfect for crop production, livestock production, and much more. Currently, there is only one Investment Visa option available in Alberta - the Farm Stream.
	
#### **不列颠哥伦比亚省**	**British Columbia**
	
不列颠哥伦比亚省拥有加拿大最灵活、多样化和最具竞争力的经济体之一，使其成为您新业务或扩展业务的首选目的地。该省首府温哥华地理位置便利，可协助开展全球贸易路线，包括美国、亚洲和墨西哥。企业也得到了我们负责财政的政府的大力支持，这使得在我省创业更容易、成本更低。最后，不列颠哥伦比亚省拥有丰富的商业资源，包括超过 240 万受过良好教育的劳动力。	British Columbia has one of Canada's most flexible, diverse, and competitive economies, making it a prime destination for your new or expanded business.

Businesses are also heavily supported by our fiscally responsible government, making it easier and cheaper to start a business in our province. Lastly, British Columbia is rich in business resources, including a well-educated workforce of over 2,4 million.
	
不列颠哥伦比亚省目前有两种投资者签证选择，即省提名企业家移民类别和区域试点计划。这两种选择都有一套独特的标准，您必须满足这些标准才能在加拿大开展业务。	British Columbia currently has two Investor Visa options, the provincial nominee Entrepreneur Immigration Stream and the Regional Pilot Program.

首都温尼伯因其强劲的经济、低廉的生活成本和优质职业机会而闻名于世。	The capital city, Winnipeg, is becoming known throughout the world for its strong economy, low cost of living, and opportunities for quality careers.
	
曼尼托巴省的生活成本如此之低，以至于 76% 的移民在该省生活的头五年内成为了房主。这肯定是95%的人移民加拿大后永久定居曼尼托巴省的众多原因之一。	The cost of living in Manitoba is so low that 76% of immigrants become homeowners within the first five years of living in the province. This is surely one of many reasons why 95% of them permanently settle in Manitoba after immigrating to Canada.

#### **新不伦瑞克**	**New Brunswick**
	
熟练的劳动力在新不伦瑞克等待着您的业务。该省拥有全国最高的毕业率和最快的互联网，使其成为生产力的黄金地段。由于加拿大和美国的运营成本最低，新企业在该省蓬勃发展。出于这个原因，以及许多其他原因，新不伦瑞克省的首府弗雷德里克顿在 2016 年赢得了年度创业社区。	A skilled labor force awaits your business in New Brunswick. The province has the highest graduation rate and the fastest internet in the country, making it a prime spot for productivity. New businesses flourish in the province due to having the lowest operating costs in Canada and the U.S. For this reason, and many others, New Brunswick's capital city, Fredericton, won the startup community of the year in 2016.

小企业经营着纽芬兰和拉布拉多的经济。事实上，40% 的人口受雇于这些企业。纽芬兰和拉布拉多拥有发达的科技产业，这里的风景适合冒险和生态旅游。鉴于该省急需更多的粮食供应，农业领域的投资空间很大。	Small business enterprises run Newfoundland and Labrador's economy. In fact, 40% of the entire population is employed by these businesses. Newfoundland and Labrador have developing tech industries, and the landscape lends itself to adventure and ecotourism opportunities. Seeing as the province is in great need of a larger food supply, there is plenty of room to invest in the agricultural sector.

PEI 政府认识到新业务发展的重要性，为希望在该省开展新业务的企业家提供许多支持性举措，例如启动基金。拥有丰富的资源和沿海城镇轻松的氛围，您在爱德华王子岛的生意一定会蒸蒸日上。爱德华王子岛工作许可证是目前该省唯一的商务签证选择。	The Government of PEI, recognizing the importance of new business development, offers many supportive initiatives, like the Ignition Fund, to entrepreneurs looking to start a new business in the province. With plenty of resources at your disposal and the relaxed atmosphere of the coastal towns, your business in PEI will surely flourish. The Prince Edward Island Work Permit is currently the only business visa option in the province.
	
#### **萨斯喀彻温省**	**Saskatchewan**
	
凭借加拿大最低的省税和丰富的林业、矿业、农业和能源资源储备，您的企业将在萨斯喀彻温省享受更低的运营成本。您还应该考虑在这个草原省份创业，因为它拥有加拿大第三大年轻工人比例。	With the lowest provincial tax in Canada and large reserves of resources in forestry, mining, agriculture, and energy sectors, your business will enjoy lower operating costs in Saskatchewan. You should also consider starting a business in this prairie province because it has the third-largest percentage of young workers in Canada.
	
#### **育空地区**	**Yukon**
	
在育空地区开展业务可以让您获得丰富的资源和一个在很大程度上尚未开发的业务创新领域。育空地区政府已将电影、林业、技术、采矿、石油、天然气和旅游部门确定为该省的主要商业部门。	Starting a business in Yukon gives you access to an abundance of resources and a terrain that is still largely untapped for business innovation. The Government of Yukon has identified the film, forestry, technology, mining, oil, gas, and tourism sectors as the primary business sectors of the province.
	
针对这些行业之一的企业将有很大的成功机会，尤其是在您的劳动力中有育空人（加拿大人均拥有学位最多的人口）。	A business targeting one of these sectors will have a great chance of success, especially with Yukoners (the population with the most holders of degrees per capita in Canada) in your workforce.
	
### 自雇计划	The Self-Employed Program
	
要根据自雇计划获得加拿大商业移民的资格，申请人必须证明他们具有相关的艺术或运动经验，使他们能够在原籍国居住时从事自雇工作。	To qualify for business immigration to Canada under the Self-employed Program, an applicant must demonstrate that they have the relevant artistic or athletic experience that has allowed them to be self-employed while living in their country of origin.
	
此外，候选人必须能够通过他们在加拿大的相关经验和技能对这些领域之一做出合理的重大贡献，才能成功申请。	The candidate must furthermore be able to make a reasonably significant contribution to one of these fields through their relevant experience and skills in Canada in order to be successful in their application.
	
自雇计划与企业家签证计划的区别之一是它没有净资产要求。加拿大自雇计划的另一个好处是，您只需要在所选领域有两年的经验，就可以在该文化或体育领域进行实践。	One of the wonderful things about the Self-employed Program which sets it apart from an Entrepreneur's Visa Program is that there is no net-worth requirement. Another perk of the Self Employment Program in Canada is that you only need two years of experience in your chosen field in order to practice in that area of culture or athletics.
	
在申请自雇计划之前要考虑的最重要的事情之一是确保您符合申请的资格要求。下表简要列出了您需要满足的资格标准，以便有资格获得自雇移民签证计划。	One of the most important things to consider before applying for the self-employed program is to make sure that you meet the eligibility requirements to apply. The following table presents a simplified breakdown of the eligibility criteria you need to meet in order to qualify for the self-employed immigration visa program.
