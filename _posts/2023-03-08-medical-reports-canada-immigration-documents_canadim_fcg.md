加拿大移民程序的最终要求之一是体检报告。每个永久居留申请人都必须接受体检，然后移民官才能批准他们的申请。体检在确定候选人是否可以进入加拿大方面起着重要作用。	One of the final requirements for Canada’s immigration process is a medical exam report. Every applicant for permanent residence must undergo a medical exam before an immigration officer can approve their application. Medical exams play an important role in determining whether a candidate is admissible to Canada.

医疗不可接受性可能会阻止申请人以永久居民、学生或临时工的身份来到加拿大。有两种类型的医疗问题可能导致拒绝：	Medical inadmissibility can prevent an applicant from coming to Canada as a permanent resident, student, or temporary worker. There are two types of medical issues that could result in refusal:
	
1. 您或您的任何受抚养家庭成员对公众的健康或安全构成威胁；	1.  You, or any of your dependent family members, pose a danger to the health or safety of the general public;
2. 您或您的任何受抚养家庭成员的病情会对加拿大的健康或社会服务造成过度压力或需求。	2.  You, or any of your dependent family members, have a condition that would cause excessive strain or demand on Canadian health or social services.
	
_\*过度需求被定义为预期治疗费用超过加拿大个人年平均健康和社会服务费用的五倍的情况。_	_\*Excessive demand is defined as a condition where the expected cost of treatment would exceed five times the annual average health and social services costs for an individual in Canada._
	
申请人是否符合健康要求，是根据授权医生进行的体检，根据医疗证明或医疗报告确定的。因此，体检报告是一份重要的移民文件，可以对您成功移民加拿大的机会产生重大影响。	Whether an applicant fulfills the health requirements is determined by a Medical Certificate or Medical Report based on a medical exam conducted by an authorized medical practitioner. Therefore, the medical report is an important immigration document that can have a significant impact on your chances of successfully immigrating to Canada.
	
## 谁应该接受加拿大的移民体检？	Who should undergo Canada’s immigration medical exam?
	
与主申请人一起，所有受抚养人，**包括不陪同主申请人到加拿大的人**，都应接受移民体检并获得体检报告。申请人的资格取决于他或她的所有家属是否满足健康要求。	Along with the principal applicant, all dependants, **including those who are not accompanying the principal applicant to Canada**, should undergo the immigration medical exam and obtain the medical report. An applicant’s eligibility depends on all his or her dependants fulfilling the health requirement.
	
要获得在加拿大永久居留的资格，申请人和所有家属不得患有危及公共健康或对加拿大卫生系统造成过度压力的疾病。该要求自申请人提交加拿大永久居留申请之时起生效。	To become eligible for permanent residence in Canada, the applicant and all dependants must not suffer from a condition that puts public health at risk or places excessive strain on the Canadian health system. This requirement comes into effect from the time the applicant files the application for Canadian permanent residence.
	
某些申请在加拿大工作或学习的外国公民可能还需要进行体检。了解是否需要体检的最佳方法是访问 IRCC 的专用页面。	Certain foreign nationals applying to work or study in Canada may also require a medical exam. The best way to find out if a medical exam is required is by visiting IRCC’s dedicated page.
	
## 何时获得医疗报告	When to obtain the medical report
	
根据申请的移民项目，申请人有两种体检选择。	Depending on the immigration program they are applying to, applicants have two options for undergoing the medical exam.
	
1. **在提交移民申请之前联系合格的医生并完成体检。**在这种情况下，申请人必须在申请中附上一份预先用药通知 (IMM 1017B) 的副本，作为体检已完成的证明。此选项适用于快速入境申请人。	1.  **Contact a qualified physician and complete the exam before submitting the immigration application.** In this case, the applicant must include a copy of the upfront medication notification (IMM 1017B) with their application as proof the medical exam was completed. This option is available to Express Entry applicants.
2. **在提交申请后启动流程。**或者，申请人可能需要等待收到体检指示。在这种情况下，申请人必须在说明中规定的期限内完成考试并提交报告。	2.  **Initiate the process after submitting an application.** Alternatively, an applicant may need to wait to receive instructions for getting the medical exam. In this case, the applicant must complete the exam and submit the report within the deadline provided with the instructions.
	
## 谁是 IRCC 授权的指定医师？	Who is an IRCC authorized panel physician?
	
加拿大移民的体检必须由 IRCC 批准的指定医师进行。在特殊情况下，IRCC 可能会给予豁免并暂时允许非指定医师进行检查。然而，这种豁免很少授予加拿大境外的医生。此选项主要适用于实际居住在加拿大的移民申请人。	The medical exam for Canadian immigration must be with an IRCC approved panel physician. In exceptional cases, IRCC may grant a dispensation and temporarily permit a non-panel physician to conduct the exam. However, the dispensation is very rarely granted to physicians outside Canada. This option is available primarily to immigration applicants who are physically present in Canada.
	
## 加拿大移民体检期间会发生什么	What to expect during a medical exam Canadian immigration
	
根据加拿大政府的规定，移民体检通常需要以下任何一项或全部：	According to the government of Canada, an immigration medical exam will typically require any or all of the below:
	
- 回顾过去的病史	-   review of past medical history
- 对申请人记录的医学评估	-   medical assessment of records respecting the applicant
- 身体检查	-   physical examination
- 心理检查	-   mental examination
- 回顾过去的病史	-   review of past medical history
- 实验室测试	-   laboratory test
-   诊断测试	-   diagnostic test
- 对申请人记录的医学评估	-   medical assessment of records respecting the applicant
- 尿液分析 - 5 岁及以上的申请人	-   urinalysis – applicants age 5 and older
- 胸部 X 光检查（前后位）——11 岁及以上的申请人	-   chest x-ray (posterior-anterior view) – applicants age 11 and older
- 梅毒 - 15 岁及以上的申请人	-   syphilis – applicants age 15 and older
- HIV – 15 岁及以上的申请人	-   HIV – applicants age 15 and older
	
## 加拿大移民体检费用	Canadian immigration medical exam cost
	
加拿大移民的体检费用将根据访问的指定医生而有所不同。申请人有责任支付与体检有关的所有费用。	The cost of a medical exam for Canadian immigration will vary depending on the panel physician visited. Applicants are responsible for paying all fees involved with the medical exam.
	
## 体检报告的内容	Contents of a medical exam report
	
您的医疗报告将包含以下详细信息：	Your medical report will contain the following details:
	
- 个人资料摘要	-   Summary of personal details
- 您同意体检	-   Your consent to the medical exam
- 病史问题	-   Medical history questions
- 体检报告	-   Physical exam report
- 化验报告	-   Lab test report
- 胸部 X 光报告和发现	-   Chest X Ray report and findings
- 涵盖尿液分析、HIV 检测、梅毒检测和其他医疗报告的报告	-   Reports covering urinalysis, HIV test, Syphilis test, and other medical reports
- 其他相关信息	-   Other relevant information
	
在大多数情况下，指定医师将以电子方式直接向 IRCC 提交报告。当医生无法使用“eMedical”电子提交工具时，IRCC 只接受纸质报告。	In most cases, the panel physician will submit the report electronically directly to IRCC. IRCC only accepts paper-based reports when the physician does not have access to the ‘eMedical’ electronic submission facility.
	
重要的是要注意，医疗报告是 IRCC 的财产，如果您希望保留一份副本作为记录，您必须特别向您的指定医师提出要求。	It is important to note that the medical report is the property of IRCC and that you must specifically make a request to your panel physician if you wish to retain a copy for your records.
	
## 加拿大移民体检报告的有效期是多久？	How long is a Canadian immigration medical report valid for?
	
如果您通过了体检并且未因健康原因被取消资格，则此阳性报告的有效期为自体检之日起 12 个月。无论考试是在加拿大还是在国外进行，这个有效期都是一样的。	If you clear the medical exam and are not disqualified on health grounds, then this positive report will be valid for a period of 12 months from the date of the medical assessment. This validity period is the same whether the examination was done in Canada or a foreign country.
	
如果有效期已过——自您接受体检以来已超过 12 个月——那么您和您的家属将必须再次接受体检才能继续保持资格。这就是为什么在文件开始处理后进行考试可能有益的原因之一。如果处理期超过 12 个月，前期测试可能会失效。	If the validity period has expired — more than 12 months have passed since you underwent the medical exam — then you and your dependents will have to undergo the examination again in order to continue to remain eligible. This is one reason why doing the exam after the file has begun processing may be beneficial. An upfront test may lapse if the processing period exceeds 12 months.
