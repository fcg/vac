对于那些寻求更好生活质量并想学习法语的人来说，移民到魁北克可能是一个有吸引力的选择。由于其独特的移民系统和该省致力于在其境内保护法语，该省是一个有吸引力的移民目的地。魁北克政府认识到在其境内保护法语和文化的重要性，这就是为什么它实施了一个独特的移民系统，可以严格控制谁可以进入该省。虽然这比移民到其他省份需要更多的工作，但如果有一个明确的计划和一些研究，这绝对是可以实现的。	Migrating to Quebec could be an attractive option for those who are looking for a better quality of life and want to learn French. The province is an attractive destination for immigrants due to its unique immigration system and the province’s commitment to protecting the French language within its borders. The Quebec government recognizes the importance of protecting the French language and culture within its borders, which is why it has implemented a unique immigration system that allows for tight control over who can enter the province. Although it requires a bit more work than immigrating to other provinces, with a clear plan and some research it’s definitely achievable.
	
该系统要求那些希望移民的人通过其各种计划之一直接向魁北克提出申请。符合该计划标准并被选中的申请人将获得魁北克省选拔证书 (CSQ)。本文件由 Ministère de l’Immigration, de la Francisation et de l’Intégration du Québec 签发。候选人获得 CSQ 后，他们必须向加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 申请永久居留权。在授予永久居留身份之前，IRCC 将进行医疗、安全和犯罪检查。	This system requires those wishing to immigrate to apply directly to Quebec through one of its various programs. The applicants who meet the program’s criteria and are selected are issued with a Certificat de sélection du Québec (CSQ). This document is issued by the Ministère de l’Immigration, de la Francisation et de l’Intégration du Québec. Once a candidate has a CSQ, they must then apply to Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) for permanent residence. IRCC will conduct medical, security, and criminality checks before granting permanent residence status.
	
**魁北克移民系统的自治 The Autonomy of Quebec’s Immigration System**
	
魁北克省在其移民计划上拥有更多的自主权，这主要是由于 1968 年成立了自己的移民部。自该部成立以来，该省一直在推动对移民的更多控制，直到 20 多年后的 1991 年，魁北克省-加拿大协议赋予该省制定自己的入学目标的责任。今天，魁北克省是加拿大唯一一个发布年度移民计划并完全控制其经济移民准入的省份。	Quebec has more autonomy over its immigration programs due largely to the launch of its own immigration ministry in 1968. Ever since the establishment of the ministry, the province continued to push for more control over immigration until over 20 years later in 1991, when the Quebec-Canada Accord gave the province the responsibility for setting its own admission targets. Today, Quebec is the only province in Canada that releases yearly immigration-level plans and has total control of its economic immigration admissions.
	
然而，这种自主权并不是绝对的，因为移民仍然是加拿大联邦政府和省政府的共同责任。虽然魁北克选择了它希望接纳的技术工人，但加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 对所有接纳有最终决定权，无论移民类别如何。	This autonomy however is not absolute, as immigration remains a shared responsibility between the federal and provincial governments in Canada. While Quebec selects the skilled workers it wishes to admit, the Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) has the final decision on all admissions, regardless of the class of immigration.
	
**Coalition Avenir Québec (CAQ) 移民政策 Coalition Avenir Québec (CAQ) Immigration Policy**
	
魁北克未来联盟 (CAQ) 自 2018 年以来一直执政，其移民政策侧重于选择最有机会融入魁北克社会的移民。为了实现这种融合，他们优先考虑法语技能以及对魁北克文化和价值观的了解。例如，移民、法语化和融合部预计，到 2023 年，79% 的经济移民将掌握法语，所有类别的移民中这一比例将达到 66%。	The Coalition Avenir Québec (CAQ) has been in power since 2018, and its immigration policy focuses on selecting immigrants who have the best chances of integrating into Quebec society. In order to achieve this integration, they prioritize French language skills, as well as knowledge of Quebec’s culture and values. For instance, the Ministry of Immigration, Francization, and Integration expects that 79% of economic immigrants in 2023 will have knowledge of the French language, as well as 66% of immigrants across all categories.
