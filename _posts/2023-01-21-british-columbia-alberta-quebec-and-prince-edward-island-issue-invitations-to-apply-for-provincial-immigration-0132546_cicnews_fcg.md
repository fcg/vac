不列颠哥伦比亚省、艾伯塔省、魁北克省和爱德华王子岛省发出申请省级移民的邀请 四个省份在最近的省级移民抽签中邀请了候选人。	British Columbia, Alberta, Quebec and Prince Edward Island issue invitations to apply for provincial immigration Four provinces have invited candidates in most recent provincial immigration draws.
	
本周，不列颠哥伦比亚省、阿尔伯塔省、魁北克省和爱德华王子岛省已发出邀请，通过省级移民计划向候选人提出申请。阿尔伯塔省和魁北克省的抽签是 12 月发生的抽签的最新出版物。	British Columbia, Alberta, Quebec and Prince Edward Island have issued invitations to apply to candidates through provincial immigration programs this week. Alberta and Quebec draws are recent publications of draws that occurred in December.
	
大多数加拿大省和地区（魁北克和努纳武特除外）都有自己的省提名计划 (PNP)。通过这些项目，有兴趣的候选人可能会被邀请申请省提名。获得省提名有利于获得永久居留权。	Most Canadian provinces and territories (except for Quebec and Nunavut) operate their own Provincial Nominee Programs (PNPs). Through these programs, interested candidates may be invited to apply for provincial nomination. Receiving a provincial nomination can be advantageous for gaining permanent residence.
	
魁北克的移民计划由该省管理，与加拿大的移民计划不同。魁北克省是唯一一个控制所有经济类移民的省份。	Quebec’s immigration programs are administered by the province and are distinct from Canada’s immigration programs. Quebec is the only province that has control over all economic class immigrants.
	
省提名计划 (PNP) 每年有 105,000 名永久居民。它始于 1998 年，此后每年 PNP 录取人数稳步增长。联邦和省政府都认为这是促进城市中心以外地区经济发展的有效工具。	The Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) accounts for 105,000 PR admissions per year. It began in 1998 and the annual number of PNP admissions has since increased steadily. Both federal and provincial governments consider it an effective tool to promote economic development outside of urban centers.
