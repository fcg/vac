加拿大看护人试点计划申请人的工作经验要求减半那些已经根据家庭托儿服务提供者 (HCCP) 和家庭支持工作者试点 (HSW) 申请的人现在需要更少的加拿大工作经验才有资格获得永久居留权。	Work experience requirement cut in half for applicants in Canada’s caregiver pilot programs Those who have applied under the Home Child Care Provider (HCCP) and Home Support Worker Pilot (HSW) will now need less Canadian work experience to qualify for permanent residence.
	
今天在斯卡伯勒发表讲话时，国会议员萨尔玛扎希德和雷奇瓦尔迪兹宣布，有资格获得永久居留权的看护人在加拿大的工作经验将从 24 个月减少到 12 个月。	Speaking from Scarborough today, Members of Parliament Salma Zahid and Rechie Valdez announced that the amount of work experience in Canada required for a caregiver to qualify for permanent residence is being reduced from 24 to 12 months.
	
该变更将于 2023 年 4 月 30 日生效，并且对已经申请的看护人具有追溯力。加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 将确认申请人具有所需的工作经验。	The change will take effect as of April 30, 2023, and is retrospective for caregivers who have already applied. Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) will confirm that applicants have the required amount of work experience.
	
此外，现有看护人途径下的一些名额已预留给已经通过之前的工作许可在加拿大拥有工作经验的看护人，以便他们能够申请永久居留权。	Additionally, some spaces under the existing caregiver pathways have been reserved for caregivers who already have work experience in Canada from a previous work permit so that they are able to apply for permanent residence.
	
IRCC 预计这一变化将对大约 90% 正在处理看护人计划的申请人产生影响。	IRCC expects that the change will have an impact on approximately 90% of applicants who are in processing for the caregiver programs.
	
这两个试点项目均于 2019 年启动，将于 2024 年 6 月到期。近 1,600 名看护者及其家人已通过这些项目成为永久居民。仅2022年一年，就有近1100名看护者及其家属通过这两个试点成为永久居民。	Both pilot programs were launched in 2019 and are set to expire in June 2024. Nearly 1,600 caregivers and their family members have become permanent residents through the programs. In 2022 alone, nearly 1,100 caregivers and their family members became permanent residents through the two pilots.
	
移民部长肖恩·弗雷泽 (Sean Fraser) 说：“看护人是加拿大家庭的一个重要选择，在许多成长中的孩子、年迈的父母和那些需要额外专业护理的人的生活中发挥了重要作用。” “通过将在加拿大所需的工作经验减少到一年，更多的看护人和他们的家人将有资格更快地过渡到永久居留权，这意味着他们可以在加拿大安顿下来并开始他们生活的下一章。”	“Caregivers are an important option for families in Canada and have played an instrumental role in the lives of many growing children, aging parents, and those who need additional specialized care,” said immigration minister Sean Fraser. “By reducing the work experience required in Canada to one year, more caregivers and their families will become eligible to transition to permanent residence sooner, meaning that they can settle down and start the next chapter of their lives here in Canada.”
	
其他资格标准保持不变。这两个项目的候选人必须能够证明：	Other eligibility criteria remain the same. Candidates for both programs must be able to demonstrate:
	
* 语言测试结果显示加拿大语言基准 (CLB) 为 5；	  Language test results showing a Canadian Language Benchmark (CLB) of 5;
* 一年加拿大专上教育或外国同等学历；和	  One year of Canadian post-secondary education or the foreign equivalent; and
* 通过可接受性检查（健康、犯罪和安全）。	  Pass an admissibility check (health, criminality, and security).
	
在工作经验方面，候选人现在必须能够证明：	In terms of work experience, candidates must now be able to show:
	
* 属于国家职业分类 (NOC) 代码 4411 或 4412 的工作经验	  work experience that falls under National Occupational Classification (NOC) codes 4411 or 4412
* 工作经验必须是这些工作之一，不能是两种工作的混合	  Work experience must be in one of these jobs, it cannot be a mix of both jobs
* 候选人的工作与NOC职位描述相符，并且完成了大部分主要职责	  The candidate’s job matched the NOC job description and they completed most of the main duties
* 全职工作定义为每周至少 30 小时的有偿工作	  Full-time work is defined as at least 30 hours of paid work each week
	
### 加拿大人口老龄化	Canada’s aging population
	
2021 年的人口普查显示，加拿大有 861,395 名 85 岁以上的人。还有 210 万年龄在 75 至 85 岁之间的人，其中许多人住在老年公寓和护理设施中。 2016 年的数据显示，有 50 万居民接受长期护理。	The 2021 census shows that there are 861,395 people living in Canada who are over the age of 85. There are a further 2.1 million between the ages of 75 and 85, many of whom live in senior’s residences and care facilities. Data from 2016 shows there were 500,000 residents in long-term care.
	
此外，预计到 2030 年将有近 900 万加拿大人活到 65 岁。这些因素加在一起意味着加拿大现在和不久的将来都需要更多的护理人员来满足人们的需求。	Additionally, nearly nine million Canadians are expected to reach 65 by 2030. These factors combined mean that Canada needs more caregivers to support the needs of the population both now and in the near future.
	
还需要更多的托儿服务，因为大多数加拿大家庭要么是单亲家庭，要么是双职工家庭，这意味着父母双方都在外工作。许多人没有家人在身边帮助他们承担育儿责任，只能依靠家中的日托或私人护理。	There is also a need for more childcare as the majority of Canadian families are either single-parent or dual-income, meaning both parents are working outside the home. Many do not have family close by to help with childcare responsibilities and rely on daycare or private care in their homes.
	
为了满足这些需求，加拿大正在继续聘请医疗保健和社会援助部门的专业人员。最新的劳动力调查显示，2023 年 1 月雇用了 7,000 多名移民，但截至 2022 年 11 月仍有 131,800 个职位空缺。	To meet these needs Canada is continuing to hire professionals in the healthcare and social assistance sectors. The most recent labour force survey shows that over 7,000 immigrants were hired in January 2023 but there were still 131,800 job vacancies as of November 2022.
