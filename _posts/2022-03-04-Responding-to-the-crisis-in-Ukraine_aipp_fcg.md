### 2022 年 3 月 4 日：应对乌克兰危机	March 4, 2022: Responding to the crisis in Ukraine

为应对俄罗斯入侵乌克兰，现已采取临时处理措施，以协助申请艾伯塔省优势移民计划 (AAIP) 的乌克兰国民。将不断审查这些措施。	In response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, temporary processing measures are now in place to assist Ukrainian nationals who apply to the Alberta Advantage Immigration Program (AAIP). These measures will be reviewed on an ongoing basis.

以下临时处理措施适用于出生和公民身份的乌克兰人：	The following temporary processing measures apply to Ukrainians by birth and citizenship:

* 正在优先处理决定后服务的申请和请求。	Applications and requests for post-decision services are being priority processed.
* 在 2022 年 2 月 24 日或之后申请该计划或提出决定后服务请求的所有候选人和被提名人将退还申请费和决定后服务费请求。	Application fees and request for post-decision service fees will be reimbursed to all candidates and nominees who apply to the program or who make a request for post-decision services on or after February 24, 2022.
* 新候选人必须继续拥有有效的语言成绩和教育证书评估（如果适用）才能提交申请。由于乌克兰的冲突而缺少任何其他必需文件的候选人，如果他们仍然符合其 AAIP 流的所有选择标准，则可以提交不完整的申请。提交不完整申请的候选人必须：	New candidates must continue to have valid language results and an Educational Credential Assessment (if applicable) to submit an application. Candidates who are missing any other required documents due to the conflict in the Ukraine may submit an incomplete application if they still meet all selection criteria for their AAIP stream. Candidates who submit an incomplete application must:
* 将书面解释上传到门户网站，解释无法获取文件的原因，以及	* upload a written explanation into the portal that explains why the document(s) cannot be acquired, and
* 提供证据证明他们已向负责签发文件的个人或组织索取文件，或证明签发机构因乌克兰冲突而未签发文件。	* provide evidence that they have requested the document(s) from the individual or organization responsible for issuing the document, or evidence the issuing body is not issuing documents due to conflict in Ukraine.
* 如果当前候选人或被提名人由于乌克兰冲突而无法提供文件，他们必须提供：	If a current candidate or nominee cannot provide documents due to the conflict in Ukraine, they must provide:
* 关于无法获取文件原因的书面解释，以及	* a written explanation as to why the document(s) cannot be acquired, and
* 提供他们已向负责签发文件的个人或组织索取文件的证据，或证明签发机构因乌克兰冲突而未签发文件的证据。	* provide evidence they have requested the document(s) from the individual or organization responsible for issuing the document or evidence the issuing body is not issuing documents due to conflict in Ukraine.

AAIP 标准没有变化。乌克兰国民必须继续满足计划标准才有资格参加该计划并获得提名。	There are no changes to AAIP criteria. Ukrainian nationals must continue to meet program criteria to qualify for the program and be issued a nomination.

乌克兰国民必须使用申请门户网站申请该计划。项目官员将在评估申请时实施这些措施。	Ukrainian nationals must apply to the program using the application portal. Program officers will implement these measures when assessing applications.
