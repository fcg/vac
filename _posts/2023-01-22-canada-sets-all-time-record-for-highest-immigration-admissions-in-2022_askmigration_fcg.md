加拿大各地的加拿大人本周庆祝，因为宣布该国已超过其 2022 年接纳永久居民的破纪录目标。加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 报告称，加拿大在 2022 年接待了超过 437,000 人，这是自联邦成立以来的最高数字。	Canadians from coast to coast celebrated this week as it was announced that the country had exceeded its record-breaking goal for admissions of permanent residents in 2022. The Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) reported that Canada welcomed more than 437,000 people in 2022, and that it is the highest number seen since Confederation.
	
移民部长肖恩·弗雷泽 (Sean Fraser) 赞扬了这一里程碑，并表示：“今天对加拿大来说是一个重要的里程碑，创下了单年接待新移民的新纪录。它证明了我们国家及其人民的力量和韧性。新移民在填补劳动力短缺、为我们的社区带来新的观点和人才、丰富我们的整个社会、帮助我们为所有加拿大人建设更繁荣的未来方面发挥着重要作用。”	Immigration Minister Sean Fraser praised the milestone and stated, “Today marks an important milestone for Canada, setting a new record for newcomers welcomed in a single year. It is a testament to the strength and resilience of our country and its people. Newcomers play an essential role in filling labor shortages, bringing new perspectives and talents to our communities, and enriching our society as a whole that helps us build a more prosperous future for all Canadians.”

由于加拿大近年来一直致力于提高其移民接纳目标，因此破纪录数字的消息并不令人意外。该目标由部长在 11 月发布的《2023-2025 年移民水平计划》中设定。它包括到 2025 年每年增加 500,000 名新永久居民的目标。此外，政府在秋季经济声明中承诺在 2022-2023 年向 IRCC 提供 5,000 万美元，以解决持续积压的申请问题，目前在所有类别中有 109 万份申请。截至 2022 年 11 月 30 日的业务。这项投资帮助 IRCC 实现了流程现代化，增加了他们可以处理的申请数量，同时还提高了服务标准。	The news of the record-breaking numbers come as no surprise as Canada has been aiming to increase its immigration admission targets in recent years. The goal was set out by the Minister in the Immigration Levels Plan 2023-2025, which was released in November. It includes a target of 500,000 new permanent residents per year by 2025. Also, the government committed $50 million to IRCC for 2022-2023 in the Fall Economic Statement to address the ongoing backlog of applications, which stands at 1.09 million applications across all lines of business as of November 30, 2022. This investment helped IRCC to modernize their processes and increase the number of applications they can process, while also improving service standards.
	
**为什么加拿大需要移民 Why Canada Needs Immigration**
	
加拿大的人口增长严重依赖移民。该国目前有近一百万个职位空缺，并且由于劳动力老龄化而面临熟练劳动力短缺。根据 2021 年的人口普查，移民占加拿大人口增长的 75%，因为它是世界上出生率最低的国家之一，每位妇女生育 1.4 个孩子。	Canada’s population growth is heavily reliant on immigration. The nation currently has nearly one million job vacancies and is facing a skilled labor shortage due to its aging workforce. According to the 2021 census, immigrants account for 75% of Canada’s population growth as it has one of the world’s lowest birth rates at 1.4 children per woman.
