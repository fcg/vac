如果您是考虑移居加拿大的阿联酋公民，那么您并不孤单。在过去十年中，数以千计的阿联酋国民移民到加拿大，未来几年还会有更多人移民加拿大。	If you are a UAE citizen considering moving to Canada, you're not alone. In the last decade, thousands of nationals from the UAE have been immigrating to Canada, and many more will do so in the coming years.
	
搬家的原因多种多样，但往往以更好的生活质量、改善的工作前景和更高的生活水平为中心。加拿大提供所有这些以及更多。	The reasons for moving are varied but tend to center on a better quality of life, improved job prospects and a higher standard of living. Canada offers all these things and more.
	
以下文章提供了有关 2023 年从阿联酋移民到加拿大的一些最佳方式的综合指南，包括最受欢迎的移民项目是什么。	The following article provides a comprehensive guide on some of the best ways to immigrate to Canada from the UAE in 2023, including what the most popular immigration programs are.
	
你的旅程从这里开始	Your Journey Starts Here
	
## 用于移居加拿大的热门项目	Top Programs to use to Move to Canada
	
!热门节目	!Top programs
	
加拿大有大约 100 种不同的移民计划和类别。项目的绝对数量旨在迎合各种潜在移民。然而，拥有如此多的申请流和项目以便移居加拿大的意想不到的后果是，许多申请人对他们应该申请哪个移民项目感到困惑。	Canada has around 100 different immigration programs and streams. The sheer number of programs is intended to cater to every kind of prospective immigrant. However, the unintended consequence of having so many application streams and programs you can apply to so you can move to Canada is that many applicants become confused about which immigration program they should apply for.
	
诸如哪个项目适合他们以及申请哪个项目最便宜等问题是申请人选择哪个移民项目的常见决定因素。尽管如此，当许多项目都提供了这些问题的答案时，只选择一个项目来申请总是具有挑战性。	Questions such as which program will suit them and which program is the cheapest to apply for are frequent determinants of which immigration program applicants will choose. Still, when many programs provide the answers to these questions, it becomes invariably challenging to pick just one program to apply for.
	
您的原籍国也是您有资格申请哪个国家/地区的决定性因素。考虑到这一事实，对于来自阿拉伯联合酋长国的潜在移民，我们编制了一份从阿联酋移民到加拿大的最佳方式清单。	Your country of origin also plays a determining factor in which country you're eligible to apply for. With this fact in mind, for prospective immigrants from the United Arab Emirates, we have compiled a list of the best ways to immigrate to Canada from the UAE.
	
它们主要包括快速入境系统、省提名计划、学生签证以及农村和北部移民计划。	They primarily include the Express Entry system, Provincial Nominee programs, Student visa, and Rural and Northern Immigration programs.
	
## 快速通道	Express Entry
	
!快速入口	!express entry
	
加拿大的快速入境系统管理该国三个主要经济类移民类别的申请：联邦技术工人计划 (FSWP)、联邦技术贸易计划 (FSTP) 和加拿大经验类移民 (CEC)。	Canada's Express Entry system manages applications for three of the country's main economic-class immigration categories: Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP), Federal Skilled Trades Program (FSTP) and Canadian Experience Class (CEC).
	
申请流程从提交意向书开始，该意向书通过在线资料提交给联邦政府。个人资料必须包括有关申请人及其家庭成员的详细信息，例如年龄、教育程度、语言能力和工作经验。	The application process starts with submitting an Expression of Interest, which is submitted to the federal government via an online profile. The profile must include details about the applicant and their family members, such as age, education, language ability and work experience.
	
申请人还会使用称为综合排名系统 (CRS) 的基于分数的系统根据这些因素获得分数。	Applicants are also given a score based on these factors using a point-based system called the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS).
	
然后邀请得分最高的候选人通过快速通道池中的定期快速通道抽签申请永久居留权。授予候选人的分数可能因每次抽签而异。因此，获得永久居留申请邀请 (ITA) 所需的最低分数将取决于具体抽签。	The highest-scoring candidates are then invited to apply for permanent residence through regular Express Entry draws from the Express Entry pool. The number of points awarded to candidates can vary with each draw. Therefore, the minimum score required to receive an Invitation to Apply (ITA) for permanent residence will depend on the specific draw.
	
您可以参考国家职业分类系统，该系统根据管理、行政职责等共同的操作特征对加拿大的工作进行分类。	You can consult the National Occupational Classification system, which is a system that categorizes jobs in Canada according to shared operational characteristics like management, administrative duties etc.
	
然后将这些共同的操作特征分级为技能水平，让您了解加拿大对特定类型工作的重视以及从这些职业中获得的技能。	These shared operational characteristics are then tiered into skill levels which gives you an understanding of the value Canada places on specific types of jobs and the skills acquired from those occupations.
	
添加了一个新的培训、教育、经验和责任 (TEER) 系统，以适应潜在移民可能拥有的其他技能能力，例如教育、培训、工作经验和职业责任。	A new Training, Education, Experience and Responsibilities (TEER) system has been added to accommodate other skills competencies that prospective immigrants might have, such as education, training, work experience and occupational responsibilities.
	
您可以将您的 NOC 技能水平转换为 TEER 类别，并使用您的类别根据相应的 TEER 描述找出您从事的工作类型。	You can convert your NOC skill level into a TEER category and, using your category find out what kind of job you have according to the corresponding TEER description.
	
如果您未达到或超过要求的分数，您的个人资料将保留在池中。在此期间，您可以提高您的 CRS 分数，并增加您在下一次开奖时获得 ITA 的机会。	Your profile will remain within the pool if you don't meet or exceed the required score. During this time, you can improve your CRS score and increase your chances of receiving an ITA with the next draw.
	
### 如何提高我的 CRS 分数	How to Increase my CRS Score
	
您可以通过以下几种方式提高 CRS 分数。	Here are a few ways you can increase your CRS score.
	
- 获得另一个资格；	-   Get another qualification;
- 获得省提名；这计为 600 分；	-   Get a provincial nomination; this counts for 600 points;
- 与您的配偶或伴侣一起申请；	-   Apply with your spouse or partner;
- 提高您的语言技能或学习法语，因为这是加拿大的官方语言之一；和	-   Improve your language skills or learn French, as this is one of Canada's official languages; and

## 省提名计划 (PNP)	Provincial Nominee Program (PNP)
	
!省提名计划	!provincial nominee programs
	
加拿大的省提名计划 (PNP) 是 2023 年从阿联酋移民到加拿大的最佳方式之一，因为它对省和您都有好处。	Canada's Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) is one of the best ways to immigrate to Canada from the UAE in 2023 because it benefits both the province and you.
	
PNP 允许各省提名满足其特定劳动力市场需求的人。您需要具备立即做出经济贡献所需的技能、教育和工作经验。	The PNP allows provinces to nominate people who meet their specific labor market needs. You'll need the skills, education and work experience required to make an immediate economic contribution.
	
###申请省提名	Applying for a Provincial Nomination
	
申请省提名时，您有两种选择。它们如下：	You have two options when applying for a provincial nomination. They are as follows:
	
- 直接到您选择的省份 - 您可以通过您的快速通道个人资料表达对一个省份的兴趣。如果您具备他们正在寻找的技能和工作经验，您可能会获得提名。	-   Directly to the province of your choice - you can express interest in a province through your Express Entry profile. You may receive a nomination if you have the skills and work experience they're looking for.
- 几乎所有省份都有通过快速通道系统的快速通道流，您可以通过您的个人资料申请。	-   Almost all provinces have Express Entry streams through the Express Entry system that you can apply for through your profile.
	
始终申请对您的技能有需求的省份，因为这会增加您获得省提名的机会。	Always apply for a province where your skills are in demand, as this will increase your chances of receiving a provincial nomination.
	
## 工作准证	Work Permits
	
如果您无法通过 PNP 获得提名或通过邀请申请 Express 获得永久居留权，那么您可以通过获得工作许可来申请移民。工作许可证允许它的接收者移民到加拿大，以便临时或根据特定的工作义务/工作机会，并可选择在未来有资格申请并获得永久居留身份。	Should you be unable to obtain permanent residency either by obtaining a nomination through a PNP or through an invitation to apply for Express, then you apply to immigrate through the obtainment of a work permit. Work permits allow it it's recipients to immigrate to Canada in order to fulfill a specific work obligation/job offer on a temporary or per basis with the option to become eligible to apply and obtain permanent residency status in the future.
