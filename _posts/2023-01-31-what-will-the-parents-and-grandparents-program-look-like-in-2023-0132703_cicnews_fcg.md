2023 年的父母和祖父母计划会是什么样子？尽管目前没有 PGP 2023 的详细信息，但我们回顾了 2020 年以来的 PGP，以瞥见明年的潜在流程。	What will the Parents and Grandparents Program look like in 2023? Although no PGP 2023 details are currently available, we review the PGP since 2020 to provide a glimpse into the potential process for next year.
	
目前，没有关于加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 将在 2023 年用于父母和祖父母计划 (PGP) 的流程的详细信息。	At the moment, no details are available regarding the process that Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) will utilize for the Parents and Grandparents Program (PGP) in 2023.
	
截至 IRCC 在 2022 年 10 月进行的最后一次 PGP 抽签，该项目备受追捧，据说在 2020 年秋季提交了意向书的候选人库中仍有大约 155,000 名潜在赞助商。	A highly sought-after invitation, as of IRCC’s last PGP lottery in October 2022, this program is said to have approximately 155,000 potential sponsors remaining in the pool of candidates who submitted an expression of interest back in the Fall of 2020.
	
### 2020年以来PGP总结	Summary of the PGP since 2020
	
在过去三年中，IRCC 利用抽签系统随机选择哪些感兴趣的赞助商将通过 PGP 收到申请邀请 (ITA)。	In the last three years, IRCC has utilized a lottery system to randomly select which interested sponsors would receive an Invitation to Apply (ITA) through the PGP.
	
担保您的父母和祖父母移民加拿大	Sponsor your parents and grandparents for Canadian immigration
	
自 2020 年以来，PGP 的所有 ITA 均已发放给最初表示有兴趣在 2020 年 10 月至 11 月期间通过该计划担保其父母或祖父母的申请人。	All ITAs for the PGP since 2020 have been given out to applicants who originally expressed interest to sponsor their parent(s) or grandparent(s) through this program between October and November of 2020.
	
2020 年，IRCC 从候选人总数中接受了多达 10,000 份完整的 PGP 申请。 2021 年，加拿大移民部门接受了多达 30,000 名完整的申请人，而今年（2022 年），这一数字为 15,000 人。	In 2020, IRCC accepted up to 10,000 completed PGP applications from the total candidate pool. In 2021, the Canadian immigration department accepted up to 30,000 completed applicants and this year (2022), that number was 15,000.
	
IRCC 再次表示，在 2020 年秋季提交了意向书的组织中，仍有超过 150,000 名感兴趣的 PGP 赞助商。尽管目前还没有任何迹象表明加拿大是否会在 2023 年继续从该候选人库中抽选, 2023-2025 年移民水平计划可能会提供一些关于 PGP 明年将如何运作的见解。	Once again, IRCC has indicated that more than 150,000 interested PGP sponsors remain from the group that submitted an expression of interest back in Fall 2020. Although there has yet to be any hint as to whether Canada will continue to draw from this candidate pool in 2023, the 2023-2025 Immigration Levels Plan may provide some insight into how the PGP will work next year.
	
### 最新移民水平计划可能对 PGP 2023 的启示	Possible PGP 2023 revelations from the latest Immigration Levels Plan
	
尽管目前无法确定加拿大在 2023 年将发出多少 ITA 或通过 PGP 接受多少已完成的申请，但最新的 2023-2025 年移民水平计划表明该国的目标是欢迎超过 28,000 名父母和祖父母在接下来的三年中的每一年。	Although there is currently no way to determine exactly how many ITAs will be sent out or how many completed applications Canada will accept through the PGP in 2023, the latest Immigration Levels Plan for 2023-2025 indicates that the country is aiming to welcome over 28,000 parents and grandparents in each of the next three years.
	
家庭移民下父母和祖父母的具体目标如下：	The exact targets for parents and grandparents under family immigration are as follows:
	
2023 年：28,500	2023: 28,500
	
2024 年：34,000	2024: 34,000
	
2025 年：36,000	2025: 36,000
	
### PGP 的替代品：超级签证	Alternatives to the PGP: Super Visa
	
如上所述，PGP 是一项竞争激烈的计划，许多加拿大公民和永久居民都将其视为将父母和祖父母带到加拿大的途径。不幸的是，这意味着许多加拿大人未能通过这种移民途径将他们的亲人带到加拿大，这令人沮丧。	As mentioned above, the PGP is a highly competitive program that many Canadian citizens and permanent residents look toward as a pathway to bring their parents and grandparents to Canada. Unfortunately, this means that many Canadians are frustratingly unsuccessful at bringing their loved ones to Canada through this immigration pathway.
	
然而，相反，加拿大人并非没有其他选择。此选项称为超级签证。 IRCC 的超级签证计划有一套独立于 PGP 的资格标准。	Conversely, however, Canadians are not left without another option. This option is called the Super Visa. IRCC’s Super Visa program has a separate set of eligibility criteria from the PGP.
	
该计划为加拿大人提供 PGP 的替代方案，包括以下好处：	This program provides Canadians with an alternative to the PGP that includes the following benefits:
	
1) 与每年大约开放两周的 PGP 不同，超级签证全年可用	1) Unlike the PGP, which is open for roughly two weeks per year, the Super Visa is available year-round
	
2) 允许由加拿大公民或永久居民担保的父母和祖父母一次最多可在加拿大探亲五年，无需续签签证	2) Allows parents and grandparents sponsored by Canadian citizens or PRs to visit their family in Canada for up to five years at a time without a visa renewal
	
3) 允许不同的签证延期机会，使被担保人可以在加拿大停留长达七年，并允许多次入境加拿大长达 10 年。此处提供了有关不同签证延期选项的详细信息。	3) Allows for different Visa extension opportunities that enable sponsored individuals to remain in Canada for up to seven years and grants multi-entry to Canada for up to 10 years. Details on the different Visa extension options are available here.
	
4) 超级签证计划使受资助的父母和祖父母可以在加拿大和他们居住的国家之间自由旅行。这意味着如果个人的祖国需要临时居民签证 (TRV) 才能进入加拿大，在这种情况下他们无需担心重新申请 TRV。	4) The Super Visa program enables sponsored parents and grandparents to travel freely between Canada and their home country of residence. This means that if the individual’s home country requires a Temporary Resident Visa (TRV) for entry to Canada, they would not need to worry about re-applying for a TRV in this case.
	
5) 接受超级签证计划包括一封授权被担保人进入加拿大长达两年的信件（对于那些居住在不需要 TRV 进入加拿大的国家的人）	5) Acceptance into the Super Visa program includes a letter that authorizes a sponsored person’s entry into Canada for up to two years (for those living in countries that do not require TRVs for entry into Canada)
