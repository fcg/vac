为什么加拿大永久居民可能会失去他们的身份为了帮助移民和加拿大移民候选人随时了解情况，我们概述了加拿大永久居民可能失去他们的永久居民身份的不同方式。	Why a Canadian PR may lose their status To help immigrants and Canadian immigration hopefuls stay informed, we have outlined the different ways it is possible for Canadian permanent residents to lose their PR status.
	
根据 2021 年的新闻稿，加拿大去年迎来了有史以来数量最多的移民，移民占加拿大人口增长的 75% 左右。同一份报告的预测表明，到 2036 年，移民可能占加拿大总人口的 30%，比 2011 年 (20.7%) 增加 9.3%。	According to a 2021 news release, Canada welcomed its highest-ever number of immigrants to the country last year and immigration accounts for around 75% of Canada’s population growth. Projections from that same release suggest that immigrants may represent up to 30% of Canada’s total population by 2036, up 9.3% from 2011 (20.7%).
	
加拿大移民图景的很大一部分是加拿大永久居留权。截至 2021 年，全国共有 800 万加拿大永久居民。最重要的是，加拿大有一个名为移民水平计划的完整三年计划，专门用于预测在此期间打算接纳多少永久居民 (PR)。最新的水平计划（2022-2024）预计加拿大每年将迎来超过 400,000 名新永久居民。	A big part of Canada’s immigration picture is Canadian permanent residence. As of 2021, there are eight million Canadian permanent residents living across the country. On top of that, there is an entire three-year plan called the Immigration Levels Plan that Canada dedicates specifically to projecting how many permanent residents (PRs) it aims to admit over that time. The latest levels plan (2022-2024) projects that Canada will aim to welcome over 400,000 new PRs each year.
	
### 当前关于加拿大 PR 的讨论	Current discourse around PR in Canada
	
在加拿大，关于 PR 的主流讨论围绕着教导有希望成为移民的人如何作为永久居民来到加拿大。毫无疑问，有很多方法可以实现这一目标，无论是通过经济类移民、家庭类移民还是其他方式。	The dominant discourse around PR in Canada revolves around teaching immigration hopefuls how to come to Canada as permanent residents. There are undoubtedly many ways to accomplish this goal, whether that be through economic class immigration, family class immigration or another means.
	
相反，我们今天要讨论的是加拿大永久居民如何可能失去其永久居民身份。	What we would like to cover today, conversely, is how it is possible for a Canadian permanent resident to lose their PR status.
	
### 加拿大永久居民失去永久居民身份的不同方式	Different ways a PR in Canada can lose their permanent resident status
	
有几个原因可能会发生在已经成为该国永久居民的人身上。	There are several reasons that this can happen to someone who has established themselves as a permanent resident in this country.
	
1\。如果他们已经成为加拿大公民	1\. If they have become a Canadian citizen
	
2\.如果确定他们没有遵守 PR 居留义务	2\. If it has been determined that they have not complied with the PR residency obligation
	
一般来说，加拿大的永久居民必须履行居住义务，要求他们每五年在加拿大居住 730 天（两年）。	Generally, permanent residents in Canada must meet a residency obligation that requires them to live in Canada for 730 days (two years) out of every five-year period.
	
身在加拿大有一些例外情况，这仍然允许加拿大永久居民履行这一义务。如果在每五年期间有 730 天，PR 仍将被视为遵守上述居住义务：	There are some exceptions to being physically present in Canada, which would still allow Canadian PRs to meet this obligation. PRs will still be seen as complying with the above residency obligation if, for 730 days over every five-year period:
	
* 他们在加拿大境外陪同加拿大公民配偶、同居伴侣或父母（如果有关加拿大永久居民是孩子）	  They are outside Canada accompanying a Canadian citizen spouse, common-law partner, or parent (if the Canadian PR in question is a child)
* 他们在加拿大境外全职受雇于加拿大企业或“联邦公共行政/省公共服务”	  They are employed full-time outside of Canada by a Canadian business or in the “federal public administration/public service of a province”
* 他们在加拿大境外陪同属于上述类别的加拿大永久居民配偶、同居伴侣或父母（如果有关加拿大永久居民是孩子）	  They are outside Canada accompanying a Canadian PR spouse, common-law partner, or parent (if the Canadian PR in question is a child) who falls under the above category
* 它们“在规定其他合规方式的法规中提及”	  They are “referred to in regulations providing for other means of compliance”
	
3\.如果有针对他们的有效移除令	3\. If there is a removal order in effect against them
	
4\。如果此人的难民保护令已终止	4\. If the person’s refugee protection order has ceased
	
由于几个不同的原因，当局可能会决定根据《难民保护法》来到这个国家的加拿大永久居民不再需要这种保护。这些原因可能包括：	For several different reasons, authorities may determine that a Canadian PR who came to this country under the Refugee Protection Act no longer requires such protection. Those reasons can include:
	
* 加拿大永久居民自愿重新利用其国籍国的保护	  The Canadian PR has voluntarily reavailed themself of the protection of their country of nationality
* 他们自愿重新获得国籍	  They have voluntarily reacquired their nationality
* 获得新国籍，享受新国籍国的保护	  They have acquired a new nationality and now enjoy the protection of the country of that new nationality
* 他们自愿在他们曾经离开去加拿大申请难民保护的国家重新定居	  They have voluntarily become re-established in the country that they once left to claim refugee protection in Canada
* 他们寻求保护的理由已不复存在	  The reasons for which they sought protection have ceased to exist
	
5\。如果他们的难民保护申请批准已被撤销	5\. If their refugee protection claim approval has been vacated
	
在某些情况下，难民保护申请者的批准可能会被撤销，因为他们被发现直接或间接歪曲或隐瞒了与其申请相关的重要事实。	In some cases, a refugee protection claimant may have their approval reversed because they were found to have directly or indirectly misrepresented or withheld important facts related to their claim.
	
6\。如果某人放弃其永久居民身份的申请获得批准	6\. If a person’s application to renounce their permanent resident status is approved
	
### 有人失去加拿大永久居民身份后会发生什么？	What happens after someone loses their Canadian PR status?
	
失去加拿大永久居民身份后的后续步骤因个人永久居民身份被撤销的原因而异。	The next steps after losing Canadian PR status vary based on the reason that an individual’s permanent resident status was revoked.
	
例如，在加拿大永久居民自愿放弃其身份的情况下，他们将成为加拿大的临时居民六个月，除非发生以下两种情况之一：	For instance, in a situation where a Canadian PR voluntarily renounces their status, they will become a temporary resident in Canada for six months unless either of the following two instances occurs:
	
* 放弃加拿大永久居民身份的个人直接在加拿大入境口岸提出申请	  The individual renouncing their Canadian PR status applies to do so directly at a Canadian port of entry
* 放弃加拿大永久居民身份的个人在其临时居留申请获批之日并未实际出现在加拿大	  The individual renouncing their Canadian PR status is not physically present in Canada on the day that their application for temporary residence is approved
	
了解加拿大永久居留的详细信息可能会令人困惑。但是，聘请移民律师可以使事情变得容易得多。移民法专业人士可以：	Understanding the details of permanent residence in Canada can be confusing. However, retaining an immigration lawyer can make things a lot easier. Immigration law professionals can:
	
* 帮助准备申请	  Help prepare an application
* 确保申请人避免错误	  Ensure applicants avoid mistakes
* 代表申请人回复加拿大政府	  Respond on an applicant’s behalf to the Canadian government
* 利用他们的专业知识，避免在不同的申请步骤和申请处理过程中出现不必要的延误	  Use their expertise to avoid unnecessary delays throughout the different application steps and application processing
