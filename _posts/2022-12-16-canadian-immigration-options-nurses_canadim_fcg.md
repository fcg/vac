加拿大各地对护士的需求量很大；为此，加拿大有多种移民途径供护士选择。作为一名护士，您可能有资格通过联邦和省级的众多经济移民计划之一作为技术工人来到加拿大。	Nurses are in high demand across Canada; for this reason, there are a number of Canadian immigration pathways for nurses to choose from. As a nurse, you may be qualified to come to Canada as a skilled worker though one of the many economic immigration programs at both the federal and provincial level.
		
您可以通过四种主要方式来加拿大当护士：	There are four main ways that you can come to Canada as a nurse:
	
1. 快速通道	1.  Express Entry
2. 魁北克移民	2.  Quebec Immigration
3. 省提名项目	3.  Provincial Nominee Programs
4. 加拿大留学	4.  Study in Canada
	
快速通道	Express Entry
	
如果护士符合计划要求，则他们有资格根据联邦技术工人计划 (FSW) 或加拿大经验类 (CEC) 快速入境。要申请 FSW 计划，候选人必须在过去 10 年内在技术职业中至少有一年的连续工作经验。工作经历有可能是在国外完成的。	Nurses qualify for Express Entry under the Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSW) or Canadian Experience Class (CEC) if they meet the program requirements. To apply under the FSW program, candidates must have at least one year of continuous work experience within the past 10 years in a skilled occupation. It is possible for the work experience to have been completed abroad.
	
满足最低要求的候选人可以向 Express Entry 池提交个人资料。一旦他们进入游泳池，他们就会获得综合排名系统 (CRS) 的总分 1,200 分。然后，向快速通道池中排名最高的候选人发出永久居留申请邀请 (ITA)。	Candidates who meet the minimum requirements can submit a profile to the Express Entry pool. Once they’re in the pool, they receive a Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) score out of 1,200. Then, the highest-ranking candidates in the Express Entry pool are issued Invitations to Apply (ITAs) for permanent residence.
	
快速通道系统的最大优势之一是，如果您被邀请申请永久居留权，您的申请最快可在六个月内得到处理！	One of the greatest advantages to the Express Entry system is that if you are invited to apply for permanent residence, your application can be processed as soon as six months!
	
快速通道对护士的最低语言分数要求取决于个人的完整个人资料。您需要在四种语言能力中的每一种语言能力中至少获得 7.0 的加拿大语言基准 (CLB)，才有资格获得快速通道。此外，申请人必须在评估候选人的教育水平、语言技能以及他们是否在加拿大工作的六因素测试中至少获得 67/100 分。	The minimum language score requirement for nurses in Express Entry depends on the individual’s complete profile. You need to score at least a Canadian Language Benchmark (CLB) of 7.0 in English or French in each of the four language competencies to be eligible for Express Entry. In addition, applicants must score at least 67/100 on the six-factor test that assesses candidates’ education level, language skills, and whether they have a job in Canada.
	
魁北克移民	Quebec Immigration
	
护士也可能有资格参加普通技术工人计划 (QSW)，具体取决于他们在魁北克选择网格中的分数。	Nurses may also be eligible for the Regular Skilled Worker Program (QSW) depending on their score in the Quebec selection grid.
	
符合条件的候选人可以向魁北克的 Arrima 门户网站提交个人资料，该门户网站在另一个积分系统上排名。魁北克政府定期举行 Arrima 抽签，邀请候选人申请永久选拔。护士经常成为魁北克 Arrima 抽签的目标。	Eligible candidates may submit a profile to Quebec’s Arrima portal, which is ranked on another points system. The government of Quebec holds regular Arrima draws, where they invite candidates to apply for permanent selection. Nurses are often targeted in Quebec’s Arrima draws.
	
省提名计划	Provincial Nominee Programs
	
护士移民加拿大的另一种可能的移民选择是通过省提名计划 (PNP)。 PNP 是通过省政府和联邦政府之间的合作伙伴关系运行的移民计划。加拿大的每个省都有自己的 PNP，有多个流，但每个 PNP 都会导致相同的最终结果：加拿大永久居留权。	Another possible immigration option for nurses to immigrate to Canada is through a Provincial Nominee Program(PNP). PNPs are immigration programs run through a partnership between provincial governments and the federal government. Each province in Canada operates its own PNP with multiple streams, but every PNP leads to the same end result: Canadian permanent residence.
	
一些 PNP 只对已经在联邦 Express Entry 池中的候选人开放。从这些 PNP 中的一个获得提名，您将获得额外的 600 CRS 积分，几乎可以保证您将获得 ITA。	Some PNPs are only open to candidates who are already in the federal Express Entry pool. Receiving a nomination from one of these PNPs grants you an additional 600 CRS points, virtually guaranteeing you will receive an ITA.
	
许多 PNP 需要与运营它的省份有某种联系，例如居住在那里的家人或过去有在该省学习或工作的经验。其他 PNP 旨在通过接受在该省紧缺职业中具有经验的技术工人来解决该省的技能差距。	Many PNPs require some kind of a connection to the province operating it, like family residing there or having past experience studying or working in the province. Other PNPs are designed to address skills gaps in the province by accepting skilled workers with experience in occupations that are in-demand in the province.
	
例如，新斯科舍省提名计划 (NSNP) 的劳动力市场优先流只对具有特定目标职业经验的快速入境档案的候选人开放。这个流的挑战是你不能在没有先收到来自该省的邀请的情况下申请。但是，该流曾多次邀请护士申请提名。另一个以这种方式运作的流是安大略省的人力资本优先流，它也经常邀请护士申请提名。	The Labour Market Priorities stream of the Nova Scotia Nominee Program (NSNP), for example, is only open to candidates with an Express Entry profile who have experience in specific target occupations. The challenge with this stream is that you cannot apply without first receiving an invitation from the province. However, on multiple occasions, this stream has invited nurses to apply for nomination. Another stream that operates this way is Ontario’s Human Capital Priorities Stream, which also often invites nurses to apply for nomination.
	
留学加拿大	Study in Canada
	
即使您目前不符合上述任何移民选项的资格，您仍然可以来加拿大。作为一名国际学生，你可以在你的护理学位的基础上进一步发展你的职业生涯，同时在加拿大生活、学习甚至工作。	Even if you aren’t currently eligible for any of the immigration options above, you may still be able to come to Canada. As an international student, you can build on your nursing degree to help advance your career, while living, studying, and even working in Canada.
	
您在加拿大的教育甚至可能有助于提高您毕业后永久移民的资格。请记住，加拿大移民计划一直在变化，因此无法保证任何现有计划的资格标准在您毕业时都保持不变。也就是说，在现行制度下，加拿大学位可以改变世界。	Your Canadian education may even help increase your eligibility to immigrate permanently when you graduate. Keep in mind that Canadian immigration programs change all the time, so it’s impossible to guarantee that the eligibility criteria of any of the existing programs will be the same by the time you would graduate. That said, under the current system, a Canadian degree can make a world of difference.
