# 如何在 PGWP 到期的情况下维持在加拿大的 CEC 候选人身份 随着快速通道抽签继续针对 PNP 候选人，目前在加拿大持有 PGWP 的 CEC 候选人担心如何在等待期间保持身份并留在加拿大。	How to maintain status in Canada as a CEC candidate with an expiring PGWP As Express Entry draws continue to target PNP candidates, CEC candidates currently in Canada on a PGWP are worried about how to maintain status and stay in Canada while they wait.
自近两个月前的 1 月 18 日最后一次抽签以来，快速通道池中的加拿大经验类 (CEC) 候选人尚未被邀请申请永久居留权。	Canadian Experience Class (CEC) candidates in the Express Entry pool have not been invited to apply for permanent residence since the last-all program draw, nearly two months ago, on January 18.
	
从那时起，针对省提名计划 (PNP) 和联邦技术工人计划 (FSWP) 的候选人进行了抽签，这让 CEC 的许多研究生工作许可证 (PGWP) 持有者在他们的许可证接近尾声时感到焦虑他们的有效期。	Since then, draws have been program-specific for candidates in the Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) and the Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP), leaving many Post-Graduate Work Permit (PGWP) holders in the CEC anxious while their permits get closer to their expiration date.
	
与 2022 年 7 月至 2022 年 11 月期间发生的所有抽签相比，快速通道抽签模式是不规则的。在此期间的快速通道抽签是全项目的，这意味着快速通道申请管理系统中的每个候选人至少具有最低综合排名系统（CRS）分数，才有资格收到申请邀请（ITA）。	Express Entry draw patterns have been irregular compared to all the draws that took place between July and November 2022. Express Entry draws during that period were all-program, meaning every candidate in the Express Entry application management system who had at least the minimum Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) score, was eligible to receive an invitation to apply (ITA).
	
加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 在整个 COVID-19 大流行期间处理了类似的情况，当时 FSWP（2021 年 1 月）和 CEC（2021 年 9 月）的快速入境抽签暂停。	Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) dealt with a similar situation throughout the COVID-19 pandemic when Express Entry draws were paused for both the FSWP (in January 2021) and the CEC (in September of 2021).
	
作为对暂停的回应，去年 4 月，移民部长 Sean Fraser 宣布对 PGWP 在 2021 年 9 月至 2022 年 12 月期间到期的人进行一次性延期。对于 PGWP 在 2023 年到期的人，尚未宣布类似措施。	In response to the pause, last April Immigration Minister Sean Fraser announced a one-time extension for those who had a PGWP expire between September 2021 and December 2022. A similar measure has not been announced for those with PGWPs that expire in 2023.
	
PGWP 颁发给在加拿大指定学习机构完成符合条件的学习计划后希望留在加拿大的毕业生。许可证有效期最长为三年（取决于学习计划的长度）并且不能延期或续签。	PGWPs are issued to graduating students who wish to stay in Canada after they have completed an eligible program of study in Canada at a Designated Learning Institution. The permits are valid for up three years (depending on the length of the study program) and cannot be extended or renewed.
	
### 维持 PGWP 持有人的身份等待 CEC 抽签	Maintaining status as a PGWP holder waiting for a CEC draw
	
只要您在 PGWP 到期前申请另一份工作或学习许可，您就可以在 IRCC 处理您的新申请期间继续作为临时居民在加拿大工作和生活，并等待下一次 CEC 抽签。	As long you apply for another work or study permit before your PGWP expires, you can continue working and living in Canada as a temporary resident while IRCC processes your new application, and you wait for the next CEC draw.
	
如果您不保持您的临时居民身份，您将需要在您的 PGWP 到期之日停止工作并离开加拿大。根据您的预算和情况，可以申请多种临时许可证。	If you do not maintain your temporary resident status, you will need to stop working on the day your PGWP expires and leave Canada. There are multiple temporary permits to apply for, depending on your budget and circumstances.
	
**LMIA 要求的工作许可**	**LMIA-required work permits**
	
如果您有工作，您可以将 PGWP（一种开放式工作许可）更改为需要劳动力市场影响评估 (LMIA) 的许可。这意味着您的雇主需要向加拿大就业和社会发展部 (ESDC) 提交申请，以评估“雇用”您是否会对加拿大的劳动力产生积极、中立或消极的影响。如果结果是积极的或中立的，您可能仍然可以为您当前的雇主工作，但在许可证到期或您获得永久居民身份之前，您将无法在其他任何地方工作。	If you are employed, you may be able to change from a PGWP (an open work permit) to one that requires a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA). This means that your employer will need to submit an application to Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) to assess if “hiring” you will have a positive, neutral, or negative impact on Canada’s labour force. If the outcome is positive or neutral, you will likely still be able to work for your current employer, but you will not be able to work anywhere else until the permit expires or you get permanent resident status.
	
有一些计划，例如全球人才流，允许某些技术职业的雇主跳过 EDSC 通常要求的广告要求。此流下的 LMIA 处理时间可能只需两周。通常，LMIA 的广告要求意味着雇主必须在加拿大就业市场上发布所有职位空缺至少四个星期。	There are some programs, such as the Global Talent Stream, that allow employers in certain tech occupations to skip the advertising requirements usually required by EDSC. LMIA processing times under this stream can take as little as two weeks. Typically, advertising requirements for an LMIA mean that employers must advertise all job vacancies across the Canadian job market for at least four weeks.
	
**LMIA豁免工作许可**	**LMIA exempt work permits**
	
大多数情况下，LMIA 豁免许可或国际流动计划下的许可属于重要福利和互惠就业类别。要被视为具有重大利益，申请人必须被视为从事对加拿大具有社会、文化或经济利益的工作。	Most often, LMIA-exempt permits, or those under the International Mobility Program, fall under the significant benefit and reciprocal employment categories. To be considered under significant benefit, the applicant must be deemed to be doing work that has a social, cultural, or economic benefit to Canada.
	
互惠就业发生在加拿大与另一个国家签订现有协议时，例如加拿大-美国-墨西哥协议 (CUSMA) 下的协议，该协议允许来自这些国家的一些工人跨境工作，或在加拿大境内工作公司转让 (ICT) 协议。	Reciprocal employment occurs when Canada has an existing agreement with another country, such as the agreements under the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA), which allows some workers from these countries to work across borders, or work in Canada on an intra-company transfer (ICT) agreement.
	
**学习许可**	**Study permit**
	
正如您作为 PGWP 持有人可能已经经历过的那样，如果您在专上指定学习机构就读，您就有资格在加拿大工作。全日制学生有资格在学年期间每周在校外工作 20 小时，并在预定的学术休息期间全职工作。最近宣布的临时取消学生有资格工作的时间上限仅适用于 IRCC 在 2022 年 10 月 7 日或之前收到您的学习许可或延期申请的情况。	As you may have already experienced as a PGWP holder, you are eligible to work in Canada if you are enrolled in a post-secondary Designated Learning institution. Full-time students are eligible to work 20 hours a week off campus during the academic year and full-time during scheduled academic breaks. The recently announced temporary removal of the cap on hours students are eligible to work only applies if IRCC received your application for a study permit, or extensions, on or before October 7, 2022.
	
**访客签证**	**Visitor visa**
	
如果这些选项都不适合您的情况，您可以在 PGWP 到期后离开加拿大，然后以访客签证 (TRV) 返回。根据 TRV，您可以留在加拿大，但法律不允许您工作或学习。您还必须能够证明您有足够的资金来维持您逗留期间的生活。	If none of these options work for your situation, you can leave Canada when your PGWP expires and return under a visitor’s visa (TRV). Under a TRV you may stay in Canada but are you not legally allowed to work or study. You must also be able to prove that you have sufficient funds to support yourself for the length of your stay.
	
**访客记录**	**Visitor record**
	
您还可以通过申请访客记录来保持您的身份。访客记录不同于访客签证，因为您无需离开加拿大即可获得。要符合资格，您必须在 PGWP（或任何其他工作或学习许可）到期前至少 30 天提出申请。在加拿大持有访客记录期间，您将不被允许工作或学习。此外，您将无法离开加拿大，除非您打算持访客签证返回。	You can also maintain your status by applying for a visitor record. A visitor record is different from a visitor visa in that you do not need to leave Canada to get it. To be eligible, you must apply at least 30 days before your PGWP (or any other work or study permit) expires. While in Canada on a visitor record, you will not be allowed to work or study. Additionally, you will not be able to leave Canada unless you plan to return with a visitor visa instead.
