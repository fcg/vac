IRCC 允许超级签证申请人以每月分期付款的方式支付医疗保险，该规定让家人更容易在加拿大团聚。	IRCC allows Super Visa applicants to pay for medical insurance in monthly instalments The rule makes it easier for families to be together in Canada.
	
加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 宣布改变超级签证申请人支付医疗保险的方式。	Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) has announced changes to how Super Visa applicants can pay for their medical insurance.
	
为了有资格获得超级签证，申请人必须拥有满足以下所有标准的私人医疗保险：	In order to be eligible for the Super Visa, the applicant must have private medical insurance that meets all the following criteria:
	
* 涵盖医疗、住院、遣返申请人；	  It covers the applicant for health care, hospitalization, and repatriation;
* 它提供至少 100,000 美元的紧急保险；和	  It provides a minimum of $100,000 emergency coverage; and
* 自进入加拿大之日起至少 1 年有效，并在重新进入加拿大期间根据要求由边境服务官员审查后提供。	  It is valid for a minimum of 1 year from the date of entry into Canada and is available upon review by a border services officer upon request during re-entry into Canada.
	
虽然申请人以前被允许按月分期支付保险费，但 IRCC 在 8 月份宣布将要求每年预付保险费。对于 65 岁的人来说，这些付款平均为 1,500 美元，对于老年人来说可能更高。	While applicants have previously been allowed to pay for insurance in monthly instalments, IRCC announced in August that it would require annual up-front payments. These payments average at $1,500 for a 65-year-old and can be higher for older individuals.
	
这一政策变化遭到了人们的强烈反对，他们认为要求提前支付一整年的费用会造成经济负担。此外，许多人认为这是对寻求团聚但无力预先支付医疗保险费用的家庭的惩罚，导致向应得的家庭提供超级签证申请的数量减少。	This change in policy received backlash by people arguing that it was financially burdensome to require payment upfront for an entire year. In addition, many thought it was punitive towards families who were seeking to be reunited but could not afford to pay for the medical coverage upfront, causing fewer Super Visa applications to be given to deserving families.
	
去年 12 月，IRCC 宣布取消政策，申请人将再次能够按月分期支付保险费用。一位 IRCC 发言人表示，新规则被推翻是为了承认加拿大对家庭团聚的重视。	In December, IRCC announced that it was reversing the policy and applicants would be once again able to pay for the insurance in monthly instalments. An IRCC spokesperson said that the new rule was reversed to recognize the importance Canada places on reuniting families.
	
### 什么是超级签证？	What is the Super Visa?
	
超级签证允许加拿大公民和永久居民将他们的外国父母和祖父母带到加拿大最多连续五年，而无需更新他们的访客身份。超级签证持有人可以多次进入加拿大长达 10 年。	The Super Visa allows Canadian citizens and permanent residents to bring their foreign parents and grandparents to Canada for up to five consecutive years without having to renew their visitor status. Super Visa holders can enter Canada multiple times for up to 10 years.
	
超级签证是父母和祖父母计划 (PGP) 的替代方案，后者授予申请人永久居留权。尽管 PGP 非常受欢迎，但可用的名额有限。此外，IRCC 还举行抽签决定谁可以申请该计划。	The Super Visa is an alternative to the Parents and Grandparents Program (PGP), which grants permanent residence to its applicants. Although the PGP is very popular, there are limited amounts of spots available. In addition, IRCC holds lotteries to determine who will be able to apply for the program.
	
相比之下，超级签证没有抽签系统，为想要担保父母或祖父母来加拿大的人提供了更大的确定性。此外，超级签证处理通常需要几个月的时间，而 PGP 处理可能需要数年时间。	In comparison, there is no lottery system for the Super Visa, offering greater certainty to people who want to sponsor their parent or grandparent to come to Canada. Further, Super Visa processing usually takes a few months, while PGP processing can take years.
	
### 你有资格获得超级签证吗？	Are you eligible for the Super Visa?
	
为了有资格获得超级签证，您必须	In order to be eligible for the Super Visa, you must
	
* 是加拿大公民或永久居民的父母或祖父母；	  Be the parent or grandparent of a Canadian citizen or permanent resident;
* 有您的孩子或孙子签名的邀请您来加拿大的信件；	  Have a signed letter from your child or grandchild inviting you to Canada;
* 提供可以证明子女或孙子女符合最低低收入标准 (LICO) 的文件；	  Provide documents that can prove the child or grandchild meets the Low-Income Cut-Off (LICO) minimum;
* 有与子女和孙子女的父母关系证明，例如出生证明；和	  Have proof of parental relationship with child and grandchild, such as a birth certificate; and
* 有医疗保险证明。	  Have proof of medical insurance coverage.
	
如果申请人因犯罪或医疗问题而不被加拿大接纳，则他们可能不符合资格。	An applicant may not be eligible if they are inadmissible to Canada based on criminality or medical issues.
	
### 如何申请超级签证	How to apply for the Super Visa
	
获得所有必需的文件后，申请将在申请人在加拿大境外居住地的加拿大签证办公室处理。一些签证办公室可能需要额外的文件。	Once you have all the required documentation, the application is processed at the Canadian visa office in the applicant’s place of residence outside Canada. Some visa offices may require additional documentation.
	
然后根据许多因素评估申请，例如访问加拿大的目的以及家庭成员是否与他们的祖国有足够的联系。	The application is then assessed based on numerous factors such as the purpose of the visit to Canada and whether the family member has sufficient ties to their home country.
