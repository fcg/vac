移民部长肖恩·弗雷泽 (Sean Fraser) 发表声明，重申加拿大致力于支持妇女和女孩充分参与社会，特别关注新移民妇女。	Immigration Minister Sean Fraser has issued a statement reaffirming Canada’s dedication to support the full participation of women and girls in society, with a special focus on newcomer women.
	
“女性在加拿大找工作和取得成功往往面临多重障碍。这包括基于性别和种族的歧视、不稳定或低收入的就业、缺乏负担得起的儿童保育和薄弱的社会支持。这就是为什么我们在过去 2 年中投入了 1500 万美元来扩展种族化新移民女性试点，通过提供成功所需的支持和服务，使种族化新移民女性更容易找到工作，”他说。	“Women often face multiple barriers to finding work and getting ahead in Canada. This includes gender- and race-based discrimination, precarious or low-income employment, lack of affordable childcare and weak social supports. That’s why we’ve dedicated $15 million over the last 2 years to extending the Racialized Newcomer Women Pilot to make it easier for racialized newcomer women to find a job by providing the support and services they need to succeed,” he said.
	
政府还资助加拿大各地社区的 570 个服务提供商组织，为新移民提供定居服务，其中一半以上是女性。	The government is also funding  570 service provider organizations in communities across Canada to deliver settlement services to newcomers, of which more than half are women.
