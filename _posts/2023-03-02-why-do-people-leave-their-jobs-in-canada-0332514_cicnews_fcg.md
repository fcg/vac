# 为什么人们离开加拿大的工作？加拿大人离职原因的细目分类，以及它可以告诉我们有关劳动力市场的哪些信息。	Why do people leave their jobs in Canada? A breakdown of reasons why people in Canada leave their jobs, and what it can tell us about the labour market.
加拿大统计局的一项新研究显示，绝大多数加拿大工人离职的原因不是被解雇或对工作不满意。	A new study by Statistics Canada reveals that workers in Canada overwhelmingly leave their jobs for reasons other than being laid off, or unsatisfied with their employment.

一些最常见的离职原因包括重返学校、退休、生病或残疾以及个人/家庭原因。	Some of the most common reasons for leaving a job included going back to school, retiring, having an illness or disability, and personal/family reasons.
	
然而，该国目前的劳动条件是否表明这些新移民会找到可靠、有保障且令他们满意的工作？加拿大统计局最近的研究对这些关键问题提出了有利的答案。	However, do the country’s current labour conditions suggest that these new immigrants will find work that is reliably secure, and that they are content with? Statistics Canada’s recent study suggests favourable answers to these crucial questions.
	
通过查看月度劳动力调查的回复，该研究旨在阐明人们报告在 2022 年离职的原因。	Looking at responses from monthly Labour Force Surveys, the study aimed to shed light on why people reported leaving their jobs in 2022.
	
### 结果和主要发现	Results and key findings
	
该研究将回应集中在四大类上，并为每个大类给出了子原因：	The study focused responses around four broad categories, with sub-reasons given for each:
	
- 离职：包括“自身疾病或残疾”、“个人或家庭原因”、“上学”、“不满意”、“退休”和“其他原因”；	-   Job Leavers: encompassing “Own illness or disability”, “Personal or family reasons”, “Going to school”, “Dissatisfied”, “Retired”, and “Other reasons”;
- 失业者：包括“永久裁员”和“临时裁员”；	-   Job Losers: encompassing “Permanent Layoff”, and “Temporary Layoff”;
- “去年没有工作”；和	-   “Have not worked in the last year”; and
- “从未工作过”。	-   “Never Worked”.
	
为简化起见，将这些响应分为以下三类：	To simplify these responses are broken down into the following three categories:
	
- 离职者：“不满意”、“退休”；	-   Job Leavers: “Dissatisfied”, “Retired”;
- 失业者：“永久裁员”、“临时裁员”；	-   Job Losers: “Permanent Layoff”, “Temporary Layoff”;
- 所有其他原因将累计为“其他”	-   All other reasons will be cumulatively totaled as “Other”
	
百分比分数的饼图细分如下所示：	The pie chart breakdown of scores in percentages can be seen below:

这些回应有助于描绘出加拿大劳动力市场状况的全景图。	These responses help paint a broad picture of Canada’s labour market conditions.
	
### 工作保障的好兆头	Good signs for job security
	
裁员（在研究中被称为“失业者”）影响不到 10% 的受访者。在回答总人数中，全年失业人数合计仅为6.6%。这个数字主要由被永久解雇的人组成；临时裁员仅占总数的0.3%。	Layoffs (identified as “job losers” in the study) afflicted less than 10% of respondents. Among the total number of responses, people who lost their job totaled at just 6.6% throughout the year. This number was mostly comprised of people who had been permanently laid off; with temporary layoffs making up just 0.3% of the total.
	
对于那些希望加入加拿大劳动力市场的人来说，这是一个令人鼓舞的迹象。根据这项研究的结果，加拿大的工作保障仍然很强，全年裁员很少，而且有工作的人的正常工作几乎没有中断。 2022 年的许多裁员也集中在技术领域——大公司在国际范围内裁员，而加拿大的初创企业在通货膨胀率上升的情况下难以筹集资金。	This is an encouraging sign for those looking to join Canada’s labour market. Per the results of the study, job security remains strong in Canada, with very few layoffs throughout the year, and little to no interruption in regular employment for those with a job. Many of these layoffs in 2022 were also focused in the technology sector—as large companies laid off staff internationally, and Canadian start-ups struggled to raise capital in the face of higher inflation rates.
	
### 员工满意度高	High satisfaction among workforce
	
对当前工作不满意的离职者仅占受访者总数的 1%——这表明工人对就业的满意度很高。这与有关加拿大工作满意度的其他数据一致：加拿大统计局在 2016 年进行的一项研究发现，在 15,167 名受访者中，83% (12,730) 表示对他们目前的工作感到满意或非常满意。	Job leavers who were dissatisfied with their current employment made up just 1% of total respondents—indicating strong employment satisfaction among workers. This is consistent with other data that is available on Canadian job satisfaction: a 2016 study also conducted by Statistics Canada found that out of 15,167 respondents, 83% (12,730) reported being either satisfied or very satisfied with their current employment.
	
Monster.com 和独立研究公司 GfK 最近的一项研究发现，加拿大人是世界上最有可能报告“热爱”或“非常喜欢他们的工作”的人。 2022 年因不满意而离职的人比例很低，这进一步支持了这样一种观点，即在加拿大工作的人对他们找到的工作非常满意。加拿大进步的劳动法（保护外国工人和加拿大国民）也在这里要感谢。	A more recent study by Monster.com, and independent research company GfK found that Canadians were the most likely in the world to report either “loving” or “liking their job a lot”. The low rate of people leaving their job due to being dissatisfied in 2022, further bolsters the idea that people working in Canada are overwhelmingly satisfied with the employment that they find. Canada’s progressive labour laws (which protect foreign workers and Canadian nationals alike) are also to thank here.
	
这不仅是劳动力市场新进入者良好工作条件的另一个令人鼓舞的迹象，而且（与加拿大目前正在经历的历史性劳动力短缺一起考虑时）也是一个好迹象，表明该国已准备好并能够接受具有强大劳动力基础设施的新移民可以这样做。	This not only serves as another encouraging sign of good working conditions for new entrants in the labour market—but also (when considered alongside the historic labour shortages that Canada is currently experiencing), is a good sign that the country is ready and able to accept newcomers with a robust labour infrastructure to do so.
	
### 真正的原因	The real reasons
	
那么，为什么大多数人都离开了他们在加拿大的工作呢？绝大多数是出于诸如重返学校、处理残疾、家庭/个人原因，当然还有退休等原因。	So why do most people leave their jobs in Canada? Overwhelmingly it is for reasons such as going back to school, dealing with a disability, family/personal reasons, and of course retirement.
	
退休人员是一个始终如一且特别值得关注的群体，因为他们退出劳动力市场是移民加拿大的主要驱动力之一。超过 500 万加拿大人将在本十年内年满 65 岁（约占总人口的 13%）并退出劳动力市场（因此劳动力需求增加）。面对低出生率，新移民对于帮助加拿大解决随着这一人口退休而可能出现的工人短缺问题至关重要——尤其是在该国已经出现历史水平的职位空缺的情况下。	Retirees are a consistent and particularly pertinent group to pay attention to, as their exit from the workforce is one of the key drivers of immigration to Canada. More than five million Canadians are set to turn 65 this decade (roughly 13% of the population) and exit the workforce (increasing labour demand as a result). In the face of low birthrates newcomers are crucial to helping Canada address the worker shortages that are likely to occur as this demographic retires—especially as the country is already seeing historic levels of job vacancy.
	
### 关键要点	Key takeaways
	
上述数据描绘的加拿大劳动力市场图景与之前的调查结果一致：加拿大是一个劳动力满意度高、工作保障性强的国家，每年都有大量退休人员退出劳动力市场，从而推高了劳动力需求在国内。	The data covered above paints a picture of the Canadian labour market consistent with previous findings: Canada is a country with a high rate of labour satisfaction, strong job security, and a high number of retirees that exit the workforce every year, driving up labour demand in the country.
	
绝大多数情况下，这些都是新移民的积极信号；他们可以来加拿大，他们的技能（根据特定职业会有一些差异）将受到需求，并且他们可以找到一份他们满意并可以长期保留的工作——同时也受到加拿大强大的保护劳动法。	Overwhelmingly these are positive signs for newcomers; that they can come to Canada, that their skills (with some variance based on specific profession) will be in demand, and that they can find a job they are satisfied with and can retain for the longer term—while also being protected by Canada’s robust labour laws.
