IRCC 邀请 699 名 PNP 候选人参加 2023 年第五次快速通道抽签	IRCC invites 699 PNP candidates in the fifth Express Entry draw of 2023 Candidates invited in second Provincial Nominee Program-only draw of the year
	
IRCC 今天举行了 2023 年第五次快速通道抽签。	IRCC held the fifth Express Entry draw of 2023 today.
	
加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 向 699 名最低综合排名系统 (CRS) 分数为 791 的候选人发出了邀请。	Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) issued invitations to 699 candidates with a minimum Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) score of 791.
	
抽签仅适用于省提名计划的候选人。这是继 2 月 1 日和 2 月 2 日的结果之后，2023 年第三次针对特定项目的抽签。2 月 1 日的抽签只邀请了已经获得省提名的候选人，而 2 月 2 日的抽签是针对联邦技术工人计划 (FSWP) 的特定项目.	The draw was only applicable to candidates in the Provincial Nominee Program. This was the third program-specific draw of 2023 following the results on February 1 and February 2. The February 1 draw invited only candidates who had already received provincial nomination and the February 2 draw was program specific for the Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP).
	
**2023 年的抽签模式尚未确定**	**Draw pattern has yet to be established for 2023**
	
通常，快速通道抽签每两周在周三进行。然而，2023 年迄今为止的抽签与 COVID-19 大流行之前和 2022 年下半年建立的模式有很大不同。	Typically, Express Entry draws occur every two weeks on Wednesday. However, draws so far in 2023 have varied significantly from the patterns established before the COVID-19 pandemic and in the latter half of 2022.
	
自今年 1 月 11 日第一次快速通道抽签以来，抽签的进行方式出现了一些显着差异。例如，1 月 11 日的抽签发生在意外的六次暂停之后，IRCC 暗示这是由于 NOC 2021 的实施导致的 IT 系统故障。	Since the first Express Entry draw of this year on January 11, there have been some notable differences in how draws are conducted. For example, the January 11 draw took place after an unexpected six pause, IRCC has implied that this was due to an IT system glitch caused by the implementation of NOC 2021.
	
下一次抽签于 1 月 18 日举行，仅一周后。签发的 ITA 数量与 1 月 11 日相同，但 CRS 评分明显较低。	The next draw took place on January 18, only a week later. The number of ITAs issued was the same as January 11 but with a significantly lower CRS score.
	
IRCC 确实等了两周，才如预期的那样在 2 月 1 日进行了下一次抽签。然而，这次抽签的独特之处在于它不是全节目抽签。如果候选人已经根据省提名计划获得提名，他们只会获得 ITA。自 2022 年 6 月以来，IRCC 就没有进行过 PNP 抽签。此时，IRCC 恢复了所有项目的抽签，由于大流行限制和边境关闭，该抽签在 2021 年 1 月至 2022 年 7 月期间暂停。	IRCC did wait two weeks for the next draw on February 1 which occurred as expected. However, this draw was unique in that it was not an all-program draw. Candidates were only issued ITAs if they had already received a nomination under a Provincial Nominee Program. IRCC had not had a PNP only draw since June 2022. At this point, IRCC resumed all-program draws, which had been paused between January 2021 and July 2022 due to pandemic restrictions and border closures.
	
最近一次抽签是在 2 月 2 日的第二天，当时 IRCC 向 FSWP 的候选人发出了邀请。这很重要，因为自 2015 年快速通道开始以来，从未有过仅 FSWP 抽签。FSWP 是快速通道下最重要的移民途径之一。	The most recent draw was the next day on February 2, when IRCC issued invitations to candidates in the FSWP. This was significant because there has never been a FSWP only draw since Express Entry began in 2015. The FSWP is one of the most prominent immigration pathways under Express Entry.
	
快速通道抽签完全由移民部长和 IRCC 自行决定。 《移民和难民保护法》中没有任何法律规定何时进行抽签、候选人人数或最低 CRS 截止分数。从理论上讲，如果部长认为这是加拿大实现其经济优先事项的最佳方式，抽签可以每天或每几个月进行一次。	Express Entry draws are totally at the discretion of the immigration minister and IRCC. There is no law in the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act that dictates when draws will occur, the number of candidates or the minimum CRS cut-off score. Theoretically, draws could take place daily or once every several months if the minister deems that it is best way for Canada to meet its economic priorities.
	
### 什么是快速通道？	What is Express Entry?
	
Express Entry 是三个加拿大移民计划的申请管理系统：加拿大经验类移民计划 (CEC)、联邦技术工人计划 (FSWP) 和联邦技术贸易计划 (FSTP)。快速通道池中的省提名计划 (PNP) 候选人已经有资格参加其中至少一项计划。	Express Entry is the application management system for three Canadian immigration programs: the Canadian Experience Class (CEC), the Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP) and the Federal Skilled Trades Program (FSTP). Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) candidates in the Express Entry pool are already eligible for at least one of these programs.
	
Express Entry 使用基于积分的系统，即综合排名系统 (CRS)，对候选人的个人资料进行排名。得分最高的候选人会收到申请邀请 (ITA)，然后可以申请永久居留权。	Express Entry uses a points-based system, the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS), to rank candidates’ profiles. The top-scoring candidates receive an Invitation to Apply (ITA) and can then apply for permanent residency.
	
候选人申请后，IRCC 官员会审查申请并决定是否批准。一旦完成并获得批准，候选人现在就是加拿大的永久居民，离成为加拿大公民又近了一步。	After the candidate applies, an IRCC officer reviews the application and decides if they are approved. Once this is complete, if approved, the candidate is now a permanent resident of Canada and one step closer to becoming a Canadian citizen.
