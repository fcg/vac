## 这一年是 2021 年——进入 100 多年来最严重的大流行的第二年——加拿大只邀请最有可能已经在加拿大的移民。两年后，我们现在更多地了解了谁受到了邀请，以及它对已经在加拿大的快速通道候选人的看法。	The year was 2021—the second year into the worst pandemic in over 100 years—Canada was only inviting immigrants who were most likely to already be in Canada. Two years later, we now know more about who got invited, and what it says about Express Entry candidates who are already in Canada.
	
加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 最近发布了 2021 年快速入境报告。它包含了从仅邀请省提名计划 (PNP) 和加拿大经验类 (CEC) 候选人的那一年开始的快速入境的见解。	Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) recently released its 2021 Express Entry report. It contains insights into Express Entry from the year when only Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) and Canadian Experience Class (CEC) candidates were invited.
	
2021 年 IRCC 举行了 42 轮 ITA，发出了 114,431 份邀请，比 2020 年发出的 107,350 份邀请增加了 6%。2021 年，发出的总邀请中的绝大部分 (87%) 是在 CEC 下发出的——远远超过 2020 年（ 54%）和 2019 年（36%）——其余的是根据 PNP 发行的。	In 2021 IRCC held 42 ITA rounds and issued 114,431 invitations, an increase of 6 percent from the 107,350 invitations issued in 2020. In 2021, the great majority (87 percent) of the total invitations issued were under the CEC—much more than 2020 (54 percent) and 2019 (36 percent)— the rest were issued under the PNP.
	
从 2019 年到 2021 年，收到申请邀请 (ITA) 的候选人的社会人口特征发生了显着变化。这一转变向我们展示了对加拿大候选人的关注如何改变快速通道的格局。	The socio-demographic characteristics of the candidates who received Invitations to Apply (ITAs) changed significantly from 2019 to 2021. The shift shows us how focusing on candidates in Canada changes the Express Entry landscape.

#### 年龄	Age
	
例如，更多 20-29 岁的人被邀请——请注意，“被邀请”与获得永久居留权不同。	For instance, a lot more people between the ages 20-29 were invited—note that “invited” is not the same as receiving permanent residence.
	
这个年龄组在所有年龄组中获得的分数最高，通常他们获得所有 ITA 的最大部分。	This age group receives the highest number of points of all the age groups, and usually they receive the largest portion of all ITAs.
	
然而，从 2019 年到 2021 年，20-29 岁的候选人所占比例从刚刚超过一半增加到近三分之二。	However, from 2019 to 2021 the share of candidates aged 20-29 increased from just over half to almost two-thirds.
	
#### 教育	Education
	
获得 ITA 的候选人总数仍然受过高等教育。然而，获得硕士学位或实习学位的候选人较少（2019 年为 48%，而 2021 年为 19%）。	The overall number of candidates who got ITAs were still highly educated. However, fewer candidates were invited with Master’s degrees or entry-to-practice degrees (48 percent in 2019 compared to 19 percent in 2021).
	
与此同时，加拿大境内的候选人似乎最有可能持有一到三年的大专学历。 2019 年，最高教育水平为一年或两年大专课程的 ITA 持有者比例为 5%。 2021 年，这一比例激增至所有受邀候选人的 22%。	Meanwhile, in-Canada candidates appear to be most likely holding a post-secondary credential of one to three years. In 2019, the percentage of ITA holders whose highest education level was a one or two-year post-secondary program was 5 percent. In 2021, the proportion exploded to 22 percent of all invited candidates.
	
最高学历是三年或三年以上专上教育的候选人从 2019 年的 42% 增加到 2021 年的 54%。	Candidates whose highest education attainment was a post-secondary program of three years or more increased from 42 percent in 2019 to 54 percent in 2021.
	
#### 语言	Language
	
虽然 ITA 接受者的官方语言能力仍然很高，但在 2019 年至 2021 年期间下降了两个基准点。2019 年，最大比例的受邀候选人的加拿大语言基准 (CLB)/Niveaux de compétence linguistique canadiens (NCLC) 水平为 9 ( 45%）。 2021 年，最常见的级别是 CLB 7 (41%)。	While official language proficiency is still high among ITA recipients, it declined two benchmark points between 2019 and 2021. In 2019, the largest proportion of invited candidates had Canadian Language Benchmarks (CLB)/Niveaux de compétence linguistique canadiens (NCLC) level of 9 (45 percent). In 2021, the most common level was CLB 7 (41 percent).
	
CLB 7 被认为是“足够的中级”熟练程度。用户可以理解抽象概念，以及适度复杂的正式和非正式交流。 CLB 9 被认为是“初始高级能力”。	CLB 7 is considered “Adequate Intermediate” proficiency. Users can understand abstract concepts, as well as moderately complex formal and informal communication. CLB 9 is considered “Initial Advanced Ability”.
	
拥有 CLB 9 而不是 CLB 7 可以获得的额外综合排名系统 (CRS) 积分仅为 2-3 分——除非包括可转移性积分。	The extra Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) points you can get for having a CLB 9 as opposed to a CLB 7 is just 2-3 points—except when transferability points are included.
	
如果你有国外工作经验并且官方语言熟练，你可以获得 CLB 9 超过 CLB 7 的额外加分 12-25 分。从国外收到 ITA 的人较少这一事实可能表明在这里获得加分的人较少。	If you have foreign work experience with good official language proficiency you can get 12-25 additional points for having CLB 9 over CLB 7. The fact that fewer people received ITAs from abroad could indicate that fewer people got extra points here.
	
您还可以获得教育和高语言能力的可转移点。额外分数之间的差异是相同的，与 CLB 7 相比，拥有 CLB 9 的分数多 12-25 分。	You can also get transferability points for education and high language proficiency. The difference between additional points is the same, 12-25 more points for having a CLB 9 compared to a CLB 7.
	
有趣的是，虽然加拿大在 2020 年提高了法语水平的分数，但在 2021 年向符合标准的候选人发出的邀请减少了。IRCC 表示，这可能是由于转向了 CEC 特定轮次，因为从历史上看，大多数讲法语的候选人有资格根据 FSWP 但不是 CEC 被邀请。	Interestingly, although Canada increased points for French-language proficiency in 2020, fewer invitations were sent to candidates who met the criteria in 2021. IRCC says it is likely due to the shift to CEC-specific rounds, as historically, most French-speaking candidates have been eligible to be invited under the FSWP but not the CEC.
	
#### 工作经验	Work experience
	
CEC 候选人需要至少一年的加拿大工作经验（技术职业）才有资格参加该计划。	CEC candidates need at least one year of Canadian work experience—in a skilled occupation—to be eligible for the program.
	
出于这个原因，92% 的邀请发给了至少有一年符合条件的加拿大工作经验的候选人。邀请具有大量国外工作经验的候选人申请的人数较少。	For this reason, 92 percent of invitations went to candidates with at least one year of eligible Canadian work experience. Fewer candidates with significant foreign work experience were invited to apply.
	
2021 年，没有符合条件的外国工作经验的人数比例从 2019 年的 21% 飙升至 58%。	The percentage of people with no eligible foreign work experience shot up to 58 percent in 2021 from 21 percent in 2019.
	
#### 补充要点	Additional points
	
仅根据人力资本点（即工作经验、教育程度、年龄和语言能力）获得邀请的人数从 2019 年的 40% 下降到 2020 年的 27%。	The number of people who got invited based on human capital points alone (i.e. work experience, education, age, and language ability) were down from 40 percent in 2019 to 27 percent in 2020.
	
根据该报告，这种下降表明“加分”对于候选人获得 ITA 的机会越来越重要。	According to the report, this decrease suggests that “additional points” are increasingly important to a candidate’s chance of receiving an ITA.
	
额外加分包括那些因以下因素而获得加分的人：省提名（600 分）、就业安排（50 或 200 分）、加拿大的高等教育证书（15 或 30 分）、法语水平（25 或 50 分） );在加拿大有一个兄弟姐妹（15 分）。	Additional points encompass those who receive points for the following factors: provincial nomination (600 points), arranged employment (50 or 200 points), post-secondary credentials in Canada (15 or 30 points), French-language proficiency (25 or 50 points); and having a sibling in Canada (15 points).
	
在“加分”类别中得分最多可获得 600 CRS 积分。例如，如果您获得了省提名，价值 600 分，那么您将不会因为其他因素而获得分数。您可以有资格获得多种额外的积分类型，例如在加拿大拥有兄弟姐妹和法语能力的积分。	You can get a maximum of 600 CRS points for scoring in the “additional points” category. For example, if you get a provincial nomination, worth 600 points, then you won’t get points for the other factors. You can qualify for multiple additional points types, like points for having a sibling in Canada and French-language proficiency.
	
#### 性别	Gender
	
总体而言，男性收到了 2021 年发出的邀请的 57%，女性收到了 43%。从 2019 年到 2021 年，共有 21 份邀请函向表明其他性别、未指定性别或未知的候选人发出。由于人数较少，IRCC 的数据并未按这些性别类别进行细分。	Overall, men received 57 percent of the invitations issued in 2021 and women received 43 percent.  From 2019 to 2021, there were 21 invitations issued to candidates who indicated another gender, an unspecified gender or unknown. Because of the small counts, IRCC’s data is not broken down by these gender categories.
	
按计划向男性和女性发出的邀请比例是相同的：两种性别都最常收到申请 CEC 的邀请 (87%)，其次是 PNP (13%)，而 FSWP 或 FSTP 则没有。	The proportion of invitations issued to men and women by program was identical: both genders received invitations to apply to the CEC most often (87 percent), followed by the PNP (13 percent) and none under the FSWP or FSTP.
	
在查看其他要点时，这些数字通常与按性别划分的 ITA 的总体细分相一致——安排的就业除外。尽管考虑到所有其他因素，男性和女性获得额外分数的比例大约为 50-50/45-55%，但在获得符合条件的工作邀请的 ITA 候选人中，有三分之二是男性。	When looking at additional points, the figures generally align with the overall breakdown of ITAs by gender—except for arranged employment. Whereas the instances of additional points assigned to men and women were roughly 50-50/45-55 percent for all other factors, two thirds of candidates who received ITAs with eligible job offers were men.
	
该统计数据表明，男性比女性更有可能报告有效的 CRS 工作机会。	This stat suggests that men are more likely to report a valid job offer for CRS points than women.
	
#### 国家	Countries
	
加拿大是 ITA 接收者中最常见的居住国。发放给加拿大候选人的 ITA 比例从 2020 年的 63% 增长到 2021 年的 90%。	Canada was the most common country of residence among ITA receivers. The proportion of ITAs issued to candidates in Canada grew from 63 percent in 2020 to 90 percent in 2021.
	
虽然印度仍然是外国邀请者的首选居住国，但这一比例从候选人的 10% 下降到 3%。	While India remained the top country of residence for those invited from abroad, the proportion dropped from 10 percent of candidates to 3 percent.
	
尼日利亚是 2021 年 ITA 接收者第二大最常见的居住国，高于前几年的第三大最常见居住国。	Nigeria was the second most common country of residence for ITA-receivers in 2021, up from the third most common in previous years.
	
来自美国（前几年位居第二）的受邀者所占比例从 7% 下降到不足 1%。	The share of those invited from the U.S. (which had been second place in previous years) fell from 7 percent to less than 1 percent.
	
### 为什么 2021 年只有 CEC 和 PNP？	Why only CEC and PNP in 2021?
	
只邀请 CEC 和 PNP 候选人的原因是为了在边境仍然关闭的情况下达到当时创纪录的移民目标。 CEC 候选人比任何其他快速通道管理计划的候选人更有可能已经在加拿大，因为他们需要一年的加拿大工作经验。 2021 年 2 月 13 日的一轮邀请，向当时池中所有符合 CEC 资格的候选人发出了 27,000 多份 ITA，其中 90% 以上已经在加拿大并就业。	The reason for only inviting CEC and PNP candidates was to meet what were, at the time, record-high immigration targets while the border was still closed. CEC candidates are more likely than candidates of any other Express Entry-managed program to already be in Canada as they need one year of Canadian work experience. One invitation round on February 13, 2021, through which more than 27,000 ITAs were issued to all CEC-eligible candidates in the pool at that time, over 90 percent of whom were already in Canada and employed.
	
PNP 候选人，虽然不一定在加拿大，但受益于与支持移民的联邦政府的省和地区协议（除了加拿大欢迎 401,000 名新永久居民之外。）	PNP candidates, although not necessarily in Canada, benefitted from provincial and territorial agreements with the federal government that support immigration (in addition to Canada’s bid to welcome 401,000 new permanent residents.)
	
加拿大于 2021 年开始开放边境，但邀请联邦技术工人计划 (FSWP) 候选人的所有计划抽签仍暂停。 2021 年没有候选人被邀请申请 FSWP 或联邦技术贸易计划 (FSTP)。2021 年 9 月，CEC 候选人的抽签暂停，直到加拿大于 2022 年 7 月再次举行首次全项目抽签。	Canada began opening its border in 2021, but all-program draws that would invite Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP) candidates were still paused. No candidates were invited to apply to the FSWP or the Federal Skilled Trades Program (FSTP) in 2021. In September 2021, draws for CEC candidates came to a halt until Canada held its first all-program draw again in July 2022.
	
## 快速通道即将发生的变化	Upcoming changes to Express Entry
	
今年，加拿大计划在新的基础上开始邀请快速通道候选人。与其每次抽签都关注 CRS，还将邀请候选人根据加拿大政府设定的经济目标进行申请。它可以是职业、语言能力或教育程度。目前关于这些类别的具体细节很少。	This year, Canada has planned to start inviting Express Entry candidates on a new basis. Rather than focusing on CRS every draw, candidates will also be invited to apply based on an economic goal set out by the Canadian government. It could be an occupation, language ability, or education attainment. Actual details on what these categories will be are scarce at this time.
	
IRCC 表示，“这些抽签的类别将被确定，并随着时间的推移而变化，并将根据数据和劳动力市场信息，以及与省和地区合作伙伴的接触以及利益相关者的协商来告知。”	IRCC says, “categories for these draws will be established, change over time, and will be informed by data and labour market information, as well as engagement with provincial and territorial partners and through stakeholder consultations.”
	
IRCC 称之为“基于类别的选择”，预计将于 2023 年开始。	IRCC is calling it “category-based selection” and it is expected to start in 2023.
