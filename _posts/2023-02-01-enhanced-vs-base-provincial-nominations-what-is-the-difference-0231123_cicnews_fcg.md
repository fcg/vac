增强型和基本省级提名——有什么区别？省提名有两种形式——基础版和增强版提名。	Enhanced vs. Base Provincial Nominations—What is the difference? There are two forms of provincial nominations—the base version, and enhanced nominations.
	
自 1998 年实施以来，省提名计划 (PNP) 帮助了大量的人移民到加拿大。希望通过 PNP 申请的候选人可能会获得两种提名：常规（基础）PNP（与快速通道分开）或与快速通道对齐的（增强型）PNP。	Since its implementation in 1998, the Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) has helped a plethora of people immigrate to Canada. Candidates looking to apply through the PNP will potentially have two streams of nomination available to them: the regular (base) PNP (separate from Express Entry) or the Express Entry-aligned (enhanced) PNP.
	
### 基础 PNP	Base PNP
	
加拿大利用 PNP 允许某些省和地区提名外国技术工人（基于省劳动力市场、经济和个人技能因素）来加拿大工作和定居，从而帮助在全国推广移民的好处。根据该计划，技术工人可以获得永久居留权 (PR)，并最终成为入籍公民。	Canada utilizes the PNP to help spread the benefits of immigration throughout the country, by allowing certain provinces and territories to nominate foreign skilled workers (based on provincial labour market, economic, and individual skill factors) to come, work, and settle in Canada. Under the program, skilled workers may obtain permanent residence (PR) and can eventually become naturalized citizens.
	
每个省份都有多个 PNP，适用于多种类别和类型的工人。这些项目中至少有一个也将与快速通道相关联——这是增强型 PNP 提名发生的地方，也是两种提名类型之间的主要区别。	Each province has a number of PNPs for multiple categories and types of workers. At least one of these programs will be connected to Express Entry as well—this is where enhanced PNP nominations take place and the primary difference between both nomination types.
	
### 增强型 PNP	Enhanced PNP
	
根据相关省份或地区的不同，已经在快速通道池中的候选人可以通过特定省份的 PNP 收到（如果他们符合条件）“兴趣通知”。如果候选人申请并获得批准（获得省提名证书），在快速通道池中，他们现在将获得增强的 PNP 提名。	Depending on the province or territory in question, candidates already in the Express Entry pool can receive (if they are eligible) a “notification of interest” through a specific province’s PNP. If candidates apply and are approved (granted a provincial nomination certificate), while in the Express Entry pool, they now have an enhanced PNP nomination.
	
通过这一增强的提名，候选人将在快速通道池中进行管理，但（如果成功）将收到 PNP 下的移民邀请。请注意，有时这可能会发生在相反的方向（PNP 中的候选人也被邀请通过快速通道申请）；尽管当申请人被接受移民到加拿大时，是通过 PNP。	Through this enhanced nomination, candidates will be managed under the Express Entry pool, but will (if successful) receive an invitation for immigration under the PNP. Note that sometimes this can happen in the opposite direction (with candidates in the PNP being invited to also apply through Express Entry); though when applicants are accepted to immigrate to Canada, it is through the PNP.
	
### 增强提名的注意事项	Considerations for an enhanced nomination
	
增强型 PNP 提名的主要优势在于，符合条件的候选人可以获得省级提名证书，获得额外的 600 综合排名分数 (CRS) 分（几乎可以保证他们将获得 PR 的 ITA）。 CRS 是加拿大移民难民和公民身份 (IRCC) 在移民系统及其多个项目和途径下评估大多数申请人的方法。此外，获得增强提名的候选人可以在短短六个月内处理他们的 PR 申请。	The main advantage to enhanced PNP nominations is that eligible candidates can receive a provincial nomination certificate, gaining an additional 600 Comprehensive Ranking Score (CRS) points (all but guaranteeing they will receive an ITA for PR). The CRS is the method by which most applicants are assessed by Immigration Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) under the immigration system and its multiple programs and pathways. Additionally, candidates with enhanced nominations can have their PR applications processed within just six months.
	
但是，（与快速通道管理系统不同），PNP 要求被提名的申请人必须在提名他们的省份工作和定居。由于增强提名是 PNP 的一部分，因此根据该计划接受的人必须遵守这些规定。	However, (unlike with Express Entry managed systems), the PNP requires that applicants that are nominated must work and settle in the province that nominated them. As enhanced nominations are part of the PNP, those accepted under the program will have to follow these regulations.
	
请注意，一个人必须同时符合快速入境计划和他们申请的 PNP 的资格，才能获得增强提名。如果候选人不符合其中任何一项的资格，他们很可能无法寻求增强提名。	Note that one must be eligible for both an Express Entry program, and the PNP they are applying for, to receive an enhanced nomination. If candidates are ineligible for either they likely will not be able to pursue an enhanced nomination.
	
### 过程	Process
	
获得增强型 PNP 提名的过程介于 PNP 和快速通道申请过程之间。通常，作为候选人，您必须：	The process of getting an enhanced PNP nomination lies in between both the PNP and Express Entry application processes. Typically, as a candidate you must:
	
* 了解您是否有资格通过快速通道申请；	  Find out if you are eligible to apply through Express Entry;
* 向 IRCC 提交您有资格获得的一项快速通道管理计划（联邦技术工人计划、联邦技术贸易计划或加拿大经验类）的申请。从这里各省也将能够查看和评估您的 PNP 资料；	  Submit an application to IRCC for one of the Express Entry managed programs (either the Federal Skilled Worker’s Program, Federal Skilled Trades Program, or the Canadian Experience Class) that you are eligible for. From here provinces will also be able to view and assess your profile for PNP;
* 某些省份和地区可能要求您先联系他们并表明您有兴趣申请他们的增强型 PNP 流；	  Certain provinces and territories may require you to contact them first and indicate your interest in applying to their enhanced PNP stream;
* 如果省/地区同样感兴趣，他们可以向您发送“感兴趣通知”；	  If the province/territory is similarly interested they can send you a “notification of interest”;
* 从这里您可以直接联系省/地区以完成他们的 PNP 流程；	  From here you can contact the province/territory directly to go through their PNP process;
* 如果成功，您将收到一份省级提名证书——在快速通道池中为您额外获得 600 个 CRS 积分——并且几乎可以保证您从 IRCC 获得 ITA for PR；	  If successful, you will receive a provincial nomination certificate—granting you an additional 600 CRS points within the Express Entry pool—and all but guaranteeing you an ITA for PR from IRCC;
* 现在您可以提交您的 PR 申请、通过体检、警察检查并收集所有必要的文件；	  Now you can submit your application for PR, pass a medical exam, police check, and assemble all necessary documents;
* 如果一切顺利，您将获得永久居留权，并可以开始您在加拿大生活的新篇章。	  If everything is in order you will be granted PR and can begin a new chapter of your life in Canada.
