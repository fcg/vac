IRCC 恢复对从加拿大境内申请临时居留的人收集生物识别信息这一变化将影响 2023 年 2 月 23 日或之后在加拿大申请临时居留的任何人。	IRCC resuming biometrics collection for people applying for temporary residence from within Canada This change will effect anyone applying for temporary residence in Canada on or after February 23, 2023.
	
今天，加拿大政府宣布他们正在为从加拿大境内申请临时居留 (TR) 的个人“恢复生物特征收集”。	Today, the Government of Canada announced that they are “resuming the collection of biometrics” for individuals applying for temporary residence (TR) from within Canada.
	
在加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 于 2020 年 7 月 15 日对从内部申请的 TR 申请人的生物识别提交引入了一项临时豁免政策（由于 COVID-19 大流行关闭和服务中断）之后的 31 个多月后，这一恢复就恢复了加拿大。	This resumption comes more than 31 months after Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) – on July 15, 2020 – introduced a temporary exemption policy (because of COVID-19 pandemic closures and service disruptions) on biometrics submissions for TR applicants applying from inside Canada.
	
这一变化影响所有申请临时居留的个人，包括 IRCC 新闻稿中明确指出的五个申请人群体：	This change impacts all individuals applying for temporary residence, including five applicant groups that were identified explicitly in IRCC’s press release:
	
* 申请工作许可或学习许可的个人	  Individuals applying for a work permit or study permit
* 申请临时居留许可的个人	  Individuals applying for a temporary resident permit
* 申请访客签证的个人	  Individuals applying for a visitor visa
* 以学生、访客或工人身份申请延长逗留时间的个人	  Individuals applying to extend their stay as a student, visitor or worker
* 申请恢复学生、访客或工人身份的个人	  Individuals applying to restore their status as a student, visitor or worker
	
**注意：**尽管做出了这一决定，IRCC 指出某些豁免和“一些生物识别收集的临时措施”仍然适用于“特殊情况”	**Note: **Despite this decision, IRCC notes that certain exemptions and “some temporary measures for biometrics collection” remain in place for “special situations”
	
### 提交生物特征	Submitting biometrics
	
作为 TR 申请的一部分需要提交生物识别信息的个人必须确保他们在申请提交过程中支付生物识别费用。然后，申请人将通过电子邮件收到生物识别说明信，并找到有关如何在线进行生物识别的信息。	Individuals required to submit their biometrics as part of a TR application must ensure they pay the biometrics fee during the application submission process. Applicants will then receive a biometric instruction letter via email and find information on how to give biometrics online.
	
全国有 70 多个加拿大服务中心收集站点，TR 申请人可以在那里提交他们的生物识别信息，但生物识别信息收集站点仅通过预约运营。	There are more than 70 Service Canada Centre collection sites across the country where TR applicants can submit their biometrics, but biometrics collection sites operate by appointment only.
