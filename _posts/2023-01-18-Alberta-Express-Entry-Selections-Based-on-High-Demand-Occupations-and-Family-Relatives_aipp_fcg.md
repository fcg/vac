### 2023 年 1 月 18 日：基于高需求职业和家庭亲属的艾伯塔省快速通道选择	January 18, 2023: Alberta Express Entry Selections Based on High Demand Occupations and Family Relatives

艾伯塔省优势移民计划继续帮助雇主满足他们的劳动力需求，提名职业需求量大且父母、子女或兄弟姐妹是加拿大公民或居住在艾伯塔省的永久居民的个人。在艾伯塔省拥有直系亲属为这些新移民提供了现成的支持系统的额外好处，这为他们在艾伯塔省的就业和生活取得成功奠定了基础。	The Alberta Advantage Immigration Program continues to help employers meet their workforce needs by nominating individuals whose occupation is in high demand and who have a parent, child or sibling who is a Canadian citizen or permanent resident living in Alberta. Having immediate relatives in Alberta provides these newcomers with the added benefit of a ready-made support system, which sets them up for success in their employment and lives in Alberta.

加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 规定了艾伯塔优势移民计划每年可以签发的提名限额。 IRCC 向艾伯塔省提供了 6,500 份 2022 年的提名证书，并全部颁发。每年分配的提名证书的一部分可供艾伯塔省专门用于艾伯塔省快速通道流，其中包括加速技术途径。艾伯塔省快速通道流基于联邦快速通道门户中可用的个人资料信息进行操作。	Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) sets the limits for nominations the Alberta Advantage Immigration Program can issue each year. IRCC provided 6,500 nomination certificates to Alberta for 2022, all of which were issued. A portion of the annually allocated nomination certificates are available to Alberta to use specifically for the Alberta Express Entry Stream, which includes the Accelerated Tech Pathway. The Alberta Express Entry Stream operates based on available profile information in the federal Express Entry portal.

今年，艾伯塔省快速通道流抽签的一部分将结合高需求职业和直系亲属关系作为选择因素，从联邦快速通道池中完成抽签并邀请他们提交完整的申请。根据候选人的主要职业和与艾伯塔省的家庭关系，这一变化可能会增加在艾伯塔省快速通道类别下选择和收到意向通知书的可能性。如果没有收到来自该项目的意向通知信，候选人不能申请艾伯塔省快速通道流。	This year, a portion of Alberta Express Entry Stream draws will use the combination of high-demand occupations and immediate family ties as selection factors when completing draws from the federal Express Entry pool and inviting them to submit a completed application. This change may increase the likelihood for selection and receipt of a Notification of Interest letter under the Alberta Express Entry Stream, depending on a candidate’s primary occupation and family connection to Alberta. Candidates cannot apply to the Alberta Express Entry Stream without receiving a Notification of Interest letter from the program.

艾伯塔省优势移民计划的任何类别的资格标准都没有变化。这只是对该计划使用的基于类别的选择因素的调整，这些因素增加了候选人在艾伯塔省快速通道流下收到意向通知书的机会。	There is no change to eligibility criteria in any stream of the Alberta Advantage Immigration Program. This is solely an adjustment to the category-based selection factors used by the program that increase a candidate’s chances of receiving a Notification of Interest letter under the Alberta Express Entry Stream.

如果满足选择因素，则无法保证会发出意向书通知。意向通知书和申请请求受满足这些要求的潜在候选人数量、处理队列中提交的类型（职业或部门）、省经济移民优先级和可用提名数量的影响。	There is no guarantee a Notification of Interest letter will be issued if selection factors are met. Notification of Interest letters and requests to apply are affected by the volume of potential candidates meeting these requirements, the type (occupation or sector) of submissions in processing queues, provincial economic immigration priorities and the number of available nominations.

有关艾伯塔省快速通道意向通知选择因素的信息包含在“资格”页面上。	Information on Alberta Express Entry Stream Notification of Interest selection factors is included on the Eligibility page.
