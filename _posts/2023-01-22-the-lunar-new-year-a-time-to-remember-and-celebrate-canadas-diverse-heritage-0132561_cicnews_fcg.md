农历新年：纪念和庆祝加拿大多元传统的时刻 农历新年是一年一度的假期，标志着华裔人民新农历的开始。	The Lunar New Year: A Time to Remember and Celebrate Canada’s Diverse Heritage Lunar New Year is an annual holiday that marks the beginning of a new lunar calendar for people of Chinese heritage.
	
2023 年农历新年也称为春节，从今天（1 月 22 日）开始，到 2 月 1 日结束。	Also known as the Spring Festival, Lunar New Year 2023 begins today — on January 22 — and ends on February 1.
	
今年对全国各地的加拿大华人也具有重要意义，因为 2023 年也是《排华法案》颁布 100 周年。	This year also carries added significance for Chinese Canadians across the country, as 2023 also marks the 100th anniversary of the Chinese Exclusion Act.
	
接下来将介绍今年加拿大的农历新年庆祝活动，以及加拿大华人在这个国家的经历，特别是与 1923 年排华法案有关的经历。	What follows will cover the Lunar New Year celebration in Canada this year as well as the experiences of Chinese Canadians in this country over time, specifically in relation to the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1923.
	
### 2023 年农历新年	Chinese New Year 2023
	
在加拿大，华裔加拿大人是该国最大的族群之一，截至 2021 年占总人口（171 万人）的 4.6% 略多一点。换言之，许多加拿大公民和永久居民 (PR) 都会庆祝这个节日每年。	In Canada, Chinese Canadians are one of the largest ethnic groups in the country, representing slightly over 4.6% of the total population (1.71 million people) as of 2021. In other words, many Canadian citizens and permanent residents (PRs) celebrate this holiday every year.
	
每年，加拿大各地的社区都会组织农历新年庆祝活动，为庆祝的人们庆祝这一时刻。例如，安大略省的几个购物中心和社区场所昨天举行了包括舞狮游行/表演在内的活动，今天将继续进行。同样，加拿大最大的温哥华唐人街社区今天将举办第 48 届年度中国新年游行。	Annually, communities across Canada organize Chinese New Year celebrations to mark the occasion for those who celebrate. For example, several malls and community spaces in Ontario held events including a lion dance parade/performance yesterday, which they will continue today. Likewise, Vancouver’s Chinatown neighbourhood — the largest in Canada — will be hosting its 48th annual Chinese New Year parade today.
	
根据中国十二生肖，除越南外的所有地区，2023年都是兔年。	According to the Chinese zodiac, in all regions except Vietnam, 2023 is the Year of the Rabbit.
	
这表明 2023 年对于中国传统文化来说将是个好年头，因为“预计这将是充满希望的一年\[因为\]兔子在中国文化中象征着长寿、和平与繁荣。”	This suggests that 2023 will be a good year for those of Chinese heritage, as “it is predicted to be a year of hope \[because\] the Rabbit symbolizes longevity, peace and prosperity in Chinese culture.”
	
**注意：** 在越南，2023 年是猫年	**Note:** In Vietnam, 2023 is the Year of the Cat
	
尽管根据中国的十二生肖，2023 年的前景是幸运的，但同样重要的是要认识到加拿大的农历新年历史和加拿大华人社区并不总是幸福的接受和庆祝。	Despite the fortunate outlook of 2023 according to the Chinese zodiac, it is also important to recognize that Canada’s history with the Lunar New Year and the Chinese Canadian community has not always been one of blissful acceptance and celebration.
	
### 加拿大与加拿大华人社区的历史	Canada’s history with the Chinese Canadian community
	
虽然华人移民加拿大的历史可以追溯到 1700 年代，但距今不到 150 年的历史为加拿大和华人社区之间存在的紧张关系提供了很好的洞察力。	While the immigration of Chinese people to Canada can be traced back to the 1700s, history dating back less than 150 years provides a good deal of insight into the tensions that existed between Canada and the Chinese community.
	
1923 年，在对华人征收人头税 37 年之后，由于排华法案，华人移民加拿大被完全禁止了 20 多年。	In 1923, following 37 years of a head tax being imposed on people of Chinese origin, Chinese immigration to Canada was completely banned for more than 20 years thanks to the Chinese Exclusion Act.
	
**注：** 作为 1885 年《华人移民法》的一部分通过的人头税意味着“每个移民到加拿大的华人都必须缴纳费用”。这笔费用从每人 50 美元开始，然后在 1990 年提高到 100 美元，三年后又提高到 500 美元。据说在 37 年的时间里，大约有 81,000 名移民缴纳了这种人头税。	**Note:** The head tax passed as part of the 1885 Chinese Immigration Act meant that “every person of Chinese origin immigrating to Canada had to pay a fee”. This fee started at $50 per person before being raised to $100 in 1990 and then $500 just three years later. It is said that approximately 81,000 immigrants paid this head tax over 37 years.
	
对来自中国的移民的禁令对那些寻求进入加拿大的人以及已经在该国境内的人产生了重大影响。根据采访不列颠哥伦比亚大学历史教授余亨利的马修·麦克雷 (Matthew McRae) 的故事，“直到 1940 年代后期，不列颠哥伦比亚省的华人还不允许与白人一起在游泳池游泳，并且\[他们\]在电影院被隔离.许多中国移民生活在被驱逐出境的恐惧中，因为当局经常会寻找理由将人们驱逐出境。”	This ban on immigration from China led to significant ramifications for those seeking entry into Canada but also for those who were already inside the country. According to a story by Matthew McRae, who interviewed University of British Columbia history professor Henry Yu, “until the late 1940s, the Chinese in British Columbia were not allowed to swim in pools with whites and \[they\] were segregated in movie theatres. Many Chinese immigrants lived in fear of being deported because authorities would often look for reasons to remove people from the country.”
	
尽管排华法案于 1947 年结束，但直到 1967 年之前，很少有中国移民被允许进入该国，而那些真正来到加拿大的人通常只是为了家庭团聚而获准入境。	Despite the end of the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1947, few Chinese immigrants were let into the country until 1967 and those who did come to Canada were usually only granted access for family reunification purposes.
	
### 加拿大华人社区现状	The current state of the Chinese Canadian community
	
根据 2021 年的人口普查，华裔人口，包括在加拿大出生的华人和归化的中国移民，占加拿大人口的比例略低于 5%。仅次于具有印度血统的加拿大人，加拿大华人社区现在是亚裔加拿大人的第二大族群。	People of Chinese origin, including both Canadian-born Chinese people and naturalized Chinese immigrants, represent slightly under 5% of Canada’s population according to the 2021 census. Next to Canadians with Indian heritage, the Chinese Canadian community is now the second-largest ethnic group of Canadians of Asian descent.
	
在加拿大和加拿大华人之间经历了一段紧张的历史之后，虽然事情远非完美，但加拿大华人社区的状况现在呈上升趋势。事实上，华裔加拿大人是对整个国家做出的一些最显着贡献的核心。	After a strained history between Canada and Chinese people in this country, although things are nowhere near perfect, the state of the Chinese Canadian community is now trending upwards. In fact, Chinese Canadians are at the core of some of the most notable contributions made across the entire country.
	
在加拿大产生显着影响的华裔加拿大人包括第 26 任加拿大总督艾德丽安·克拉克森 (Adrienne Clarkson) 和第一位被任命为加拿大参议院议员的亚裔加拿大人薇薇安·波伊 (Vivienne Poy)。 Poy 也被认为是“在加拿大将五月确立为亚裔传统月”的推动力。	Chinese Canadians who have made a remarkable impact in this country include Adrienne Clarkson — the 26th Governor General of Canada — and Vivienne Poy, the first Canadian of Asian heritage ever appointed to the Senate of Canada. Poy is also credited as being a driving force behind “establishing May as Asian Heritage Month in Canada.”
	
在最近的一个例子中，新斯科舍省的一位加拿大华裔小企业主在 2022 年 9 月因极端慷慨的行为登上了头条新闻。Jay's Chicken and Pizza 的老板 Carol Yang 在事后向当地居民分发了 2000 份免费餐食为期两天的热带风暴菲奥娜。	In a more recent example, a Chinese Canadian small business owner in Nova Scotia made headlines for an act of extreme generosity back in September 2022. Carol Yang, the owner of Jay’s Chicken and Pizza, handed out 2000 free meals to local residents in the aftermath of tropical storm Fiona over a two-day period.
	
### 展望未来	Looking ahead
	
重要的是，尤其是在这样的时刻，记住并承认加拿大华裔社区的历史是很重要的。回顾这样的历史，或加拿大任何种族化群体的历史，都可以提醒我们加拿大所有社区持续需要接受和包容，以及从过去的错误中吸取教训以建设更美好未来的重要性。	It is important to always, but especially at moments like this, remember and acknowledge the history of the Chinese Canadian community in Canada. Looking back at such history, or that of any racialized group in Canada, serves as a necessary reminder of the ongoing need for acceptance and inclusion for all communities in Canada as well as the importance of learning from past mistakes to build a better future.
	
### 2023 年农历新年和 COVID-19	Lunar New Year 2023 and COVID-19
	
简要地回到农历新年前后的话题，这个盛大的假期带来了旅游热潮，与此同时中国的冠状病毒病例激增。这种激增导致加拿大对来自中国（以及香港和澳门）的入境航空旅客实施制裁。来自这些国家/地区的旅客必须在从今年 1 月 5 日开始的最初 30 天内，出示在前往加拿大的航班出发前不到两天取得的阴性检测结果。	Returning briefly to the conversation around Lunar New Year, the marquee holiday is bringing with it a travel rush that coincides with a surge of Coronavirus cases in China. This surge has caused Canada to impose sanctions on incoming air travellers from China (as well as Hong Kong and Macao). Travellers from these countries must, for an initial period of 30 days beginning on January 5 of this year, present a negative test result taken less than two days before their departure on a flight destined for Canada.
	
对于任何期待家人或其他亲人从中国飞来庆祝节日的加拿大人来说，这一点很重要。	This is important to note for any Canadians who are expecting family or other loved ones to fly in from China to celebrate the holiday.
