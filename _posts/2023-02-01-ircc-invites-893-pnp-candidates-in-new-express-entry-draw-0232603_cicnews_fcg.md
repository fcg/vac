IRCC 在新的快速通道抽签中邀请了 893 名 PNP 候选人 在 2023 年 2 月 1 日的抽签中只邀请了 PNP 候选人。	IRCC invites 893 PNP candidates in new Express Entry draw Only PNP candidates were invited in the February 1, 2023 draw.
	
IRCC 举行了 2023 年的第三次快速通道抽签。	IRCC has held its third Express Entry draw of 2023.
	
加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 向 893 名综合排名系统 (CRS) 最低分数为 733 的省提名计划 (PNP) 候选人发出了永久居民邀请。	Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) issued permanent resident invitations to 893 Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) candidates with a minimum Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) score of 733.
	
这是自 2022 年 7 月以来首次针对特定项目的快速通道抽签。从 7 月到今天，IRCC 举行了所有项目的抽签，它正在考虑邀请所有符合条件的快速通道候选人。在所有项目抽签中，可以从快速通道申请管理系统管理的三个项目之一中邀请快速通道候选人，而无需省级提名。	This was the first program-specific Express Entry draw since July 2022. Between July until today, IRCC was holding all-program draws in which it was considering all eligible Express Entry candidates for invitations. In an all-program draw, Express Entry candidates may be invited, without a provincial nomination, from one of the three programs managed by the Express Entry application management system.
	
本次抽签中的快速通道候选人已经获得省提名。省提名计划 (PNP) 允许加拿大各省提名支持其区域劳动力市场和人口目标的个人。除魁北克省和努纳武特地区外，大多数加拿大省份和地区都有与“快速通道”保持一致的 PNP。	Express Entry candidates in this draw have already received provincial nomination. Provincial Nominee Programs (PNPs) allow Canadian provinces to nominate individuals who support their regional labour market and population objectives. Most Canadian provinces and territories have PNPs aligned with Express Entry, except for Quebec and Nunavut.
	
获得省提名会使候选人的 CRS 分数提高 600 分。在此特定抽签中，Express Entry 候选人在获得省提名之前需要最低 CRS 分数为 133 才有资格。	Receiving provincial nomination increases a candidate’s CRS score by 600 points. In this specific draw, Express Entry candidates needed a minimum CRS score of 133 before getting provincial nomination in order to be eligible.
	
### 最近的快速通道结果	Recent Express Entry results
	
在 11 月 23 日至 1 月 11 日期间意外暂停六周后，快速通道抽签三周前恢复。IRCC 在 1 月 11 日的抽签之后于 1 月 18 日举行了另一场抽签。	Express Entry draws resumed three weeks ago after an unexpected pause of six weeks between November 23 and January 11. IRCC followed its January 11 draw by holding another one on January 18.
	
虽然暂停的原因尚未得到证实，但 IRCC 最近向_CIC 新闻_发送了一封电子邮件，暗示暂停是由于 11 月 16 日实施国家职业分类 (NOC 2021) 时出现的系统故障。	While the reason for the pause has not been confirmed, IRCC recently sent _CIC News_ an email that implies the pause was due to a system glitch that occurred with the implementation of National Occupation Classification (NOC 2021) on November 16.
	
IRCC 发言人说：“不幸的是，2022 年 11 月 16 日实施新分类系统的技术问题对 2022 年 11 月 23 日的快速通道邀请回合产生了不利影响。这些技术问题虽然给 IRCC 客户带来了极大的不便，但已得到解决。 2023 年 1 月 11 日成功实施了一轮 Express Entry 邀请。”	An IRCC spokesperson said, “Unfortunately, technical issues with the implementation of the new classification system on November 16, 2022, had adverse implications for the November 23, 2022, Express Entry invitation round. These technical issues, while a great inconvenience to IRCC clients, have since been resolved. A round of invitations for Express Entry was successfully implemented on January 11, 2023.”
	
1 月 11 日的抽签邀请了 5,500 名候选人，最低 CRS 截止分数为 507。接下来的一周，IRCC 在 1 月 18 日举行了另一场令人惊讶的抽签，候选人数量相同，但 CRS 分数显着降低，为 490。	The January 11 draw saw 5,500 candidates invited with minimum CRS cut-off scores of 507. The following week IRCC held another, surprise, draw on January 18 with the same number of candidates but a significantly lower CRS score of 490.
	
IRCC 表示，该部门正在努力恢复定期抽签。自 2015 年开始快速通道以来，抽签每两周定期在周三进行。即使在 2020 年 12 月至 2022 年 7 月期间快速通道管理项目抽签长期暂停期间也是如此，IRCC 继续邀请省提名项目的快速通道候选人。	IRCC has said the department is working to resume regular draws. Since Express Entry began in 2015, draws have occurred regularly every two weeks on Wednesdays. This was true even during a long pause of draws for Express Entry managed programs between December 2020 and July 2022 and IRCC continued to invite Express Entry candidates from the Provincial Nominee Program.
	
创建快速通道的目的是识别和定位政府认为高技能的候选人。这些候选人更有可能迅速融入并对加拿大的劳动力和经济产生积极影响。这是因为移民占加拿大劳动力增长的 90%，占人口增长的大约 75%。	Express Entry was created with the objective of identifying and targeting candidates that the government considers highly skilled. These candidates are more likely to integrate quickly and have a positive impact on Canada’s workforce and economy. This is because immigration accounts for as much as 90% of labour force growth in Canada and approximately 75% of population growth.
	
### 什么是快速通道？	What is Express Entry?
	
Express Entry 是三个加拿大移民计划的申请管理系统：加拿大经验类移民计划 (CEC)、联邦技术工人计划 (FSWP) 和联邦技术贸易计划 (FSTP)。快速通道池中的省提名计划 (PNP) 候选人已经有资格参加其中至少一项计划。	Express Entry is the application management system for three Canadian immigration programs: the Canadian Experience Class (CEC), the Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP) and the Federal Skilled Trades Program (FSTP). Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) candidates in the Express Entry pool are already eligible for at least one of these programs.
	
Express Entry 使用基于积分的系统，即综合排名系统 (CRS)，对候选人的个人资料进行排名。得分最高的候选人会收到申请邀请 (ITA)，然后可以申请永久居留权。	Express Entry uses a points-based system, the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS), to rank candidates’ profiles. The top-scoring candidates receive an Invitation to Apply (ITA) and can then apply for permanent residency.
	
候选人申请后，IRCC 官员会审查申请并决定是否批准。一旦完成并获得批准，候选人现在就是加拿大的永久居民，离成为加拿大公民又近了一步。	After the candidate applies, an IRCC officer reviews the application and decides if they are approved. Once this is complete, if approved, the candidate is now a permanent resident of Canada and one step closer to becoming a Canadian citizen.
