加拿大举行 2023 年第一轮快速通道抽签今天的全项目邀请是自 11 月 23 日快速通道抽签以来的第一轮。	Canada holds first Express Entry draw of 2023 Today's all-program round of invitations is the first since the November 23 Express Entry draw.
	
加拿大今天举行了今年的第一次快速通道抽签，也是自 11 月 23 日以来的第一次抽签。	Canada held its first Express Entry draw of the year today, and the first since November 23.
	
加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 向 5,500 名最低综合排名系统 (CRS) 分数为 507 的候选人发出了邀请。符合条件的候选人被邀请来自加拿大经验类 (CEC)、联邦技术工人计划 (FSWP) 和联邦技术行业计划 (FSTP)。所有这些都是在 Express Entry 系统下运行的程序。	Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) issued invitations to 5,500 candidates with a minimum Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) score of 507. Eligible candidates were invited from the Canadian Experience Class (CEC), Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP) and the Federal Skilled Trades Program (FSTP). All are programs that operate under the Express Entry system.
	
此次抽签标志着 ITA 签发数量的增加，是自去年 7 月恢复以来最大的全项目快速通道抽签。在 11 月 23 日的抽签中，有 750 份额外邀请，邀请了 4,750 名候选人，CRS 分数也高于 9 月 28 日抽签以来的分数。	This draw marks an increase in the number of ITAs issued, and is the largest all-program Express Entry draw since they resumed last July. There were 750 additional invitations over the November 23 draw, which invited 4,750 candidates, as well as a higher CRS score than has been seen since the draw on September 28.
	
### 2022 年快速通道	Express Entry in 2022
	
去年对于 Express Entry 来说是独特的一年。部长指示显示，在 2022 年的 23 次抽签中，向快速通道候选人发出了 46,538 份 ITA。这个数字包括 1 月和 7 月之间的抽签，这些抽签专门针对省提名计划 (PNP) 的候选人。从 2020 年 12 月开始，所有项目的快速通道抽签暂停了超过 18 个月。暂停是由于与 COVID-19 相关的旅行限制导致申请积压。在此期间，只有来自 CEC 或 PNP 的候选人收到了申请邀请 (ITA)。然而，在 2021 年 9 月，IRCC 也暂停了 CEC 的抽签。从 7 月开始并跨越今年剩余时间的所有项目抽签的 ITA 总数为 35,750。	Last year was a unique year for Express Entry. Ministerial instructions show that over the 23 draws in 2022, there were 46,538 ITAs issued to Express Entry candidates. This number includes draws between January and July, which were exclusively for candidates in Provincial Nominee Programs (PNPs). All-program Express Entry draws were paused for over 18 months starting in December 2020. The pause was due to a backlog in applications caused by COVID-19 related travel restrictions. During this period, only candidates from the CEC or PNP were issued invitations to apply (ITAs). However, in September 2021, IRCC also paused draws for the CEC.The total ITAs for just all-program draws, which began in July and spanned the rest of the year, was 35,750.
	
上一次快速通道抽签的最低综合排名系统 (CRS) 分数最低，为 491。	The last Express Entry draw saw the lowest minimum Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) score at 491.
	
### Express Entry 准备好改变	Express Entry getting ready for changes
	
在 2022 年下半年，IRCC 为 2023 年快速通道的预期变化奠定了基础。例如，在 11 月，IRCC 实施了 NOC 2021，这是对 NOC 2016 的更新。使用国家职业分类 (NOC) 系统确定快速通道候选人的职业和技能水平。	In the second half of 2022, IRCC set the stage for changes to be expected in Express Entry in 2023. For example, in November, IRCC implemented NOC 2021, an updated take on NOC 2016.  The National Occupation Classification (NOC) system is used to determine an Express Entry candidate’s profession and skill level.
	
IRCC 从将技能分类为 0-D 级别转变为基于培训、教育、经验和责任 (TEER) 的系统。新的 TEER 系统修改了 NOC 2016 的技能级别 0-E 并创建了等效的五个 TEERS。根据 NOC 2021，16 个新职业现在有资格申请由 Express Entry 管理的经济移民计划，例如 FSWP 或 CEC。	IRCC moved from categorizing skills as 0-D level to a system based on training, education, experience and responsibilities (TEER). The new TEER system has revised NOC 2016’s skill levels 0-E and created an equivalent five TEERS. Under NOC 2021, 16 new occupations are now eligible to apply for economic immigration programs managed by Express Entry, such as the FSWP or CEC. 
	
已向 IRCC 快速通道池提交个人资料的候选人被邀请独立将他们的 NOC 切换到新的 NOC 2021。必须针对其 IRCC 个人资料中包含的每个职位（工作）进行更新。如果不这样做，候选人将失去收到申请邀请 (ITA) 的资格。	Candidates who have a profile already submitted to the IRCC Express Entry pool were invited to switch their NOCs to the new NOC 2021 independently. The update must be done for each position (job) included in their IRCC profile. Failure to do so will disqualify candidates from receiving an Invitation to Apply (ITA).
	
根据 11 月 1 日发布的《2023-2025 年移民水平计划》，加拿大还将增加通过“快速通道”计划邀请的候选人数量。到 2023 年，将有 82,880 名移民通过“快速通道”进入加拿大成为永久居民。这将在 2024 年增加到 109,020 人，到 2025 年增加到 114,000 人，约占加拿大永久居民总招生目标的五分之一。这些更高的目标强调了加拿大在面临持续劳动力短缺的情况下对经济移民的重视。移民占加拿大劳动力增长的 90%，占人口增长的大约 75%。	Canada will also increase the number of candidates invited through Express Entry programs, based on the Immigration Levels Plan 2023-2025 released on November 1. In 2023, 82,880 immigrants will be admitted to Canada as permanent residents through Express Entry. This will increase to 109,020 in 2024 and 114,000 in 2025, or approximately one-fifth of Canada’s total permanent resident admissions goals. These higher targets emphasize the importance Canada places on economic immigration in the face of an ongoing labour shortage. Immigration accounts for as much as 90% of labour force growth in Canada and approximately 75% of population growth.
	
### 什么是快速通道？	What is Express Entry?
	
Express Entry 是三个加拿大移民计划的申请管理系统：加拿大经验类移民计划 (CEC)、联邦技术工人计划 (FSWP) 和联邦技术贸易计划 (FSTP)。快速通道池中的省提名计划 (PNP) 候选人已经有资格参加其中至少一项计划。	Express Entry is the application management system for three Canadian immigration programs: the Canadian Experience Class (CEC), the Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP) and the Federal Skilled Trades Program (FSTP). Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) candidates in the Express Entry pool are already eligible for at least one of these programs.
	
Express Entry 使用基于积分的系统，即综合排名系统 (CRS)，对候选人的个人资料进行排名。得分最高的候选人会收到申请邀请 (ITA)，然后可以申请永久居留权。	Express Entry uses a points-based system, the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS), to rank candidates’ profiles. The top-scoring candidates receive an Invitation to Apply (ITA) and can then apply for permanent residency.
	
候选人申请后，IRCC 官员会审查申请并决定是否批准。一旦完成并获得批准，候选人现在就是加拿大的永久居民，并且离成为加拿大公民又近了一步。	After the candidate applies, an IRCC officer reviews the application and decides if they are approved. Once this is complete, if approved, the candidate is now a permanent resident of Canada and one step closer to becoming a Canadian citizen.
