# 不列颠哥伦比亚省、魁北克省和马尼托巴省通过省级移民计划向候选人发出邀请。三个省已邀请候选人申请省提名。	British Columbia, Quebec, and Manitoba issue invitations to candidates through provincial immigration programs. Three provinces have invited candidates to apply for provincial nomination.
不列颠哥伦比亚省、魁北克省和马尼托巴省公布了通过省级移民计划向候选人发出的最新申请邀请数量。	British Columbia, Quebec and Manitoba have published the most recent number of invitations to apply issued to candidates through their provincial immigration programs.
	
除魁北克和努纳武特外，所有省份和地区都有自己的省提名计划 (PNP)。这些经济移民计划允许省政府选择最有可能成功融入省经济的候选人，同时填补劳动力的紧迫缺口。	All provinces and territories except Quebec and Nunavut operate their own Provincial Nominee Programs (PNPs). These economic immigration programs allow provincial governments to select the candidates who are most likely to successfully integrate into the provincial economy while filling urgent gaps in the labour force.
	
移民是各省和联邦政府的共同责任。 PNP 允许各省提名他们认为可以轻松融入该省并选择长期定居的候选人，但加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 对所有申请人的永久居民身份拥有最终决定权。	Immigration is a shared responsibility between the provinces and the federal government. PNPs allow provinces to nominate the candidates they feel will easily integrate into the province and choose to settle long-term but Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) has the final say on permanent resident status for all applicants.
	
魁北克移民计划的不同之处在于它们由该省管理，并且与加拿大其他移民计划不同。魁北克省是唯一一个控制所有经济类移民的省份。	Quebec’s immigration programs are different in that they are administered by the province and are distinct from the rest of Canada’s immigration programs. Quebec is the only province that has control over all economic class immigrants.
