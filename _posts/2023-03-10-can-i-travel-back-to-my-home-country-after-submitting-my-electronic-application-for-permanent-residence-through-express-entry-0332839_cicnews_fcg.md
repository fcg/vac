# 我可以在通过快速通道提交永久居留电子申请后返回我的祖国吗？继续阅读以了解更多关于在提交快速通道电子永久居留申请 (eAPR) 后可以做什么和不能做什么。	Can I travel back to my home country after submitting my electronic Application for Permanent Residence through Express Entry? Read on to understand more about what you can and cannot do after submitting your Express Entry electronic Application for Permanent Residence (eAPR).
电子永久居留申请 (eAPR) 是快速通道申请成功的结果。	An electronic Application for Permanent Residence (eAPR) is the result of a successful Express Entry application.
	
换句话说，在申请了 Express Entry 系统管理的三个项目中的任何一个（稍后会详细介绍）之后，eAPR 是申请人在收到申请邀请后最终提交给加拿大移民、难民和公民部（IRCC）的文件（ ITA）在快速通道抽签后永久居留（PR）到加拿大。	In other words, after applying to any of the three programs (more on that later) managed under the Express Entry system, an eAPR is what applicants finally submit to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) if they receive an Invitation to Apply (ITA) for permanent residence (PR) to Canada following an Express Entry draw.
	
**注意：**虽然申请人可以在提交 eAPR 后旅行，但在申请处理期间旅行时需要注意一些重要条件（更多信息见下文）	**Note:** While applicants are able to travel after submission of their eAPR, there are important conditions to note when travelling during application processing (more on that below)
	
eAPR 为成功的快速通道候选人提供 60 天的时间来申请加拿大永久居民。此时，ITA 接收者必须登录他们的 IRCC 个人资料并填写适当的表格，以根据快速通道申请 PR。简而言之，这要求申请人确保他们在申请中包含所有必需的文件，验证对 eAPR 问题的所有回答都是“完整和真实的”，并支付所有必需的费用。	eAPRs provide successful Express Entry candidates with a period of 60 days to apply for Canadian PR. At this time, ITA recipients must sign in to their IRCC profile and fill out the appropriate form to apply for PR under Express Entry. Briefly, this requires the applicant to ensure they include all required documents with their application, verify that all answers to eAPR questions are “complete and true”, and pay all required fees.
	
有关 eAPR 提交的更多详细信息，请访问加拿大政府网站（此处）。	More details on eAPR submission are available through the Government of Canada’s website here.
	
现在我们已经了解了 eAPR，在回答本文的中心问题之前，让我们首先更好地理解什么是快速通道。	Now that we understand eAPRs, before answering the question at the center of this piece, let us first better understand exactly what Express Entry is.
	
### 什么是快速通道？	What is Express Entry?
	
Express Entry 是 IRCC 给系统的名称，该系统管理三个不同项目的移民申请——加拿大经验类 (CEC)、联邦技术工人项目 (FSWP) 和联邦技术贸易项目 (FSWP)。	Express Entry is the name given by IRCC to the system that manages immigration applications to three different programs – the Canadian Experience Class (CEC), the Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP) and the Federal Skilled Trades Program (FSWP).
	
**注意：**快速通道是加拿大联邦政府将外国技术工人带到加拿大的主要移民途径之一	**Note:** Express Entry is one of the Canadian federal government’s top immigration pathways for bringing foreign skilled workers to Canada
	
Express Entry 要求有兴趣的候选人首先确定并验证他们是否有资格参加上述三个项目中的任何一个。 IRCC 概述的详细要求可用于帮助开始此过程。相反，有兴趣的候选人可以在这里回答几个问题，以验证他们是否满足快速通道的最低要求。	Express Entry requires interested candidates to first determine and verify their eligibility for any of the three above programs. Detailed requirements outlined by IRCC are available to help begin this process. Conversely, interested candidates can answer a few questions here to verify that they meet the minimum requirements for Express Entry.
	
从那里，候选人可以向 IRCC 的网站提交在线个人资料，并使用 CRS 分数计算器检查他们的综合排名系统 (CRS) 分数。 CRS 是加拿大目前用来根据各种因素对 Express Entry 候选人进行评分和排名的工具。这些因素包括人力资本（年龄、教育程度、官方语言能力等）、技能可转移性（工作经验等）等。	From there, candidates may submit an online profile to IRCC’s website and check their Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) score using a CRS score calculator. The CRS is what Canada currently uses to score and rank Express Entry candidates based on a variety of factors. These factors include Human Capital (age, education, official language proficiency etc.), Skills Transferability (work experience etc.) and more.
	
在提交他们的“快速通道”个人资料后，候选人必须等待，看看他们是否通过 IRCC 的“快速通道”抽签之一收到了 ITA，抽签大约每两周进行一次。这些抽签基于 IRCC 确定的截止分数，随机选择适用的候选人并向他们提供 ITA，允许他们向 IRCC 提交 eAPR（在收到 ITA 后 60 天内）。	After submitting their Express Entry profile, candidates must wait and see if they receive an ITA through one of IRCC’s Express Entry draws, which occur roughly every two weeks. These draws, based on a cut-off score determined by IRCC, randomly select applicable candidates and provides them with an ITA, which allows them to submit an eAPR to IRCC (within 60 days of ITA receipt).
	
**注意：** ITA 是快速入境申请人在加拿大申请永久居民的唯一途径。	**Note:** An ITA is the only way Express Entry applicants can apply for PR in Canada.
	
最后，选定的候选人必须在线提交他们的 eAPR（如上所述）并等待 IRCC 的最终 PR 决定。	Finally, selected candidates must submit their eAPR online (as detailed above) and wait for a final PR decision from IRCC.
	
### 提交我的 eAPR 后，我可以返回我的祖国吗？	After submitting my eAPR, can I travel back to my home country?
	
从加拿大境内提交 eAPR 的 PR 申请人通常可以在申请处理期间自由返回本国。如果他们有返回加拿大的愿望，他们必须持有重新入境所需的文件。	PR applicants who submit their eAPR from inside Canada are generally free to travel back to their home country while their application is being processed. Should they have the desire to return to Canada, they must have the required documents for re-entry.
	
**注意：** eAPR 处理期间的国际旅行视具体情况而定。经验丰富的移民律师可以根据个人情况在提交 eAPR 后协助解决有关旅行的个别问题。	**Note:** International travel during eAPR processing works on a case-by-case basis. An experienced immigration lawyer can assist with individual questions about travel after eAPR submission based on a single person’s circumstances.
	
要重新进入加拿大，那些已提交 eAPR 的人将需要持有有效护照。此外，根据重新入境的原因，个人必须持有有效的加拿大工作或学习许可和/或有效的访客签证/电子旅行授权 (eTA)，除非他们是美国公民或永久居民。	To re-enter Canada, those who have submitted their eAPR will need to have a valid passport. Additionally, depending on the reason for re-entry, the individual must have a valid Canadian work or study permit and/or a valid visitor visa/electronic Travel Authorization (eTA) unless they are a U.S. citizen or permanent resident.
	
请注意，访客签证，也称为临时居民签证 (TRV)，只有在申请人前往的国家/地区指定的情况下，才需要重新进入加拿大。	Please be aware that visitor visas, also known as Temporary Resident Visas (TRVs), are only required for re-entry to Canada if designated by the country to which the applicant is travelling.
	
此外，如果符合条件的外国技术工人申请桥接开放式工作许可证 (BOWP)，则他们可以在当前工作许可证到期和对 eAPR 做出最终决定之间留在加拿大。在外国公民提交 eAPR 并希望申请 BOWP 的情况下，他们也可以在 eAPR 处理期间旅行，只要他们不处于维持状态，并且他们将在工作许可到期之前返回加拿大。在此处了解有关维护状态的更多信息。	Additionally, eligible foreign skilled workers can stay in Canada between the expiration of their current work permit and the time a final decision is made on their eAPR if they apply for a Bridging Open Work Permit (BOWP). In circumstances where a foreign national submits an eAPR and wishes to apply for a BOWP, they may also travel during eAPR processing as long as they are not under maintained status and they will return to Canada prior to the expiration of the work permit. Learn more about maintained status here.
	
获得 BOWP 的资格要求有兴趣的候选人除其他标准外：	Eligibility for a BOWP requires interested candidates, among other criteria, to either:
	
- 目前持有有效的工作许可证	-   Currently have a valid work permit
- 根据移民和难民保护条例 (IRPR) 第 186(u) 节“由于根据 R201(1) 小节提交更新工作许可的申请”，保持在加拿大工作的身份和授权	-   Have maintained status and authorization to work in Canada under section 186(u) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (IRPR) “due to submitting an application to renew their work permit under subsection R201(1)”
- 有资格恢复他们的临时居民身份，并有权获得工作许可工作	-   Be eligible to restore their temporary resident status with authorization to work on a work permit
	
同样，如果这种情况下的外国国民来自需要 TRV 的国家，他们必须确保获得有效的 TRV 或 eTA 才能重新进入加拿大。	Again, if the foreign national in this situation is from a country that requires a TRV, they must ensure that they obtain a valid TRV or eTA for re-entry to Canada.
