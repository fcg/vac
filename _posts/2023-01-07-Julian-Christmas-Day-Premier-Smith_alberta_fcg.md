“致所有根据儒略历庆祝圣诞节的人——信奉使徒、东正教和东方基督教信仰的艾伯塔人——愿这是你与家人和其他在你心中占有特殊地位的人分享的幸福日子。“To everyone celebrating Christmas according to the Julian calendar - Albertans who follow the Apostolic, Orthodox and Eastern Christian faiths - may this be a blessed day you are sharing with family and others who have a special place in your heart.

“我们一直生活在困难时期。我知道许多家庭做出了牺牲，接受了他们的极限考验，对于那些从乌克兰来到我们省的新移民来说，他们看到了世界上最糟糕的情况。“We have been living through difficult times. I know that many households have made sacrifices, had their limits tested, and for those newcomers to our province from the Ukraine, seen some of the worst the world has to offer.

“即便如此，圣诞节的荣耀仍未减弱。基督诞生的奇迹仍然是一个深刻的真理和信仰的源泉。“Even so, the glory of Christmas Day stands undiminished. The miracle of Christ's birth remains a profound truth and source of faith.

“这个圣诞节让我们沿着善良、同情、爱和忠诚的道路前进。今天是庆祝慷慨带来的快乐、来自家人的爱和支持的力量，以及信仰力量带来的慰藉。“This Christmas Day gestures us forward along the road of kindness, compassion, love and loyalty. Today is a celebration of the joy that generosity brings, the strength of love and support from family, and solace in the power of faith.

“我向今天庆祝的每个人致以最热烈的祝愿。愿你的心充满圣诞精神。”“My very warmest wishes to everyone today who is celebrating. May your hearts be filled with Christmas spirit.”
