作为一个被阿尔伯塔省和萨斯喀彻温省边界分割开来的城市，食品贸易问题一直是一个长期关注的问题。这项为期两年的试点旨在找到一种解决方案，以帮助劳埃德明斯特和加拿大各地的类似边境城镇。As a city split by the Alberta-Saskatchewan border, food trade issues have been a longtime concern. The two-year pilot aims to find a solution that could help Lloydminster and similar border towns throughout Canada.

该试点由劳埃德明斯特商会管理，将缓解这两个省的食品企业在劳埃德明斯特市的贸易中面临的挑战。目标是让安全食品进城进城，仿佛没有省界。The pilot, administered by the Lloydminster Chamber of Commerce, will ease the challenges faced by food businesses in both provinces for trade into all of the city of Lloydminster. The goal is for safe food to move into and within the city as if there was no provincial border.

> “多年来，劳埃德明斯特食品企业一直在寻求针对其独特问题的解决方案，而这个试点项目是朝着解决方案迈出的激动人心的一步。我期待看到我们减少食品贸易繁文缛节的努力将如何改善劳埃德明斯特的生活，并进一步减少省际贸易壁垒。”“Lloydminster food businesses have been asking for a solution for their unique issues for years, and this pilot project is an exciting step toward a solution. I look forward to seeing how our efforts to reduce red tape on food trade will make life better in Lloydminster and inspire further reductions to interprovincial trade barriers.”

> “萨斯喀彻温省政府的首要任务之一是减少官僚主义的繁文缛节。该试点计划将使跨境贸易更加便利。”“One of the Government of Saskatchewan’s priorities is reducing bureaucratic red tape. This pilot program will allow ease of trade into and across the city across the border.”

> “农民和食品生产商在种植粮食以养活加拿大家庭和全世界方面发挥着关键作用，同时努力提高其可持续性。我们的政府与省级同事和业界一道，解决了劳埃德明斯特市食品企业面临的贸易障碍。这是联邦政府与省-地区合作伙伴如何采取行动改善国内贸易和支持所有人的经济增长的另一个例子。”“Farmers and food producers play a critical role in growing food to feed Canadian families and the world while striving to improve their sustainability. Together with provincial colleagues and industry, our government addressed trade obstacles faced by food businesses in the city of Lloydminster. This is another example of how the federal government along with provincial-territorial partners are taking action to improve domestic trade and support economic growth for everyone.”

1 月 16 日，CFIA 发布了修改加拿大安全食品法规的意向通知，以解决劳埃德明斯特的独特情况。On Jan. 16, the CFIA published a notice of intent to amend the Safe Food for Canadians Regulations to address Lloydminster’s unique situation.

联邦法规管理加拿大省际食品贸易和商业。要进行省际贸易，即使是在劳埃德明斯特市内，食品企业也必须遵守《加拿大食品安全法》及其法规的规定。Federal regulations govern interprovincial food trade and commerce in Canada. To trade interprovincially, even within the city of Lloydminster, food businesses must comply with the provisions of the _Safe Food for Canadians Act_ and its regulations.

在试点项目下，食品进出省运输仍执行本规定。试点的两年时间表将为收集数据和提供长期解决方案提供时间。Under the pilot program, these regulations and provisions will still be in effect when food is transported in and out of the province. The pilot’s two-year timeline will give time to collect data and inform long-term solutions.

有兴趣的参与者需要在劳埃德明斯特商会注册。Interested participants will be required to register with the Lloydminster Chamber of Commerce.

艾伯塔省、萨斯喀彻温省和加拿大政府一致认为，在即将到来的加拿大可持续农业伙伴关系下，为这一独特的省际贸易挑战寻找解决方案应该是一个优先事项。最终，食品企业将能够在劳埃德明斯特内交易安全食品，同时在省级监管下运营。The governments of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Canada agreed that finding a solution to this unique interprovincial trade challenge should be a priority under the upcoming Sustainable Canadian Agricultural Partnership. Ultimately, food businesses will be able to trade safe foods within Lloydminster while operating under provincial oversight.
