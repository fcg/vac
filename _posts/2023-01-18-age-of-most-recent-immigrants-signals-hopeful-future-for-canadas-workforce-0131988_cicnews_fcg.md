大多数新移民的年龄预示着加拿大劳动力充满希望的未来 大多数加拿大新移民的年龄都在 25 到 54 岁之间。阅读更多内容以了解为什么这会对加拿大的全国劳动力产生重大好处。	Age of most recent immigrants signals hopeful future for Canada’s workforce Most of Canada’s recent immigrants are between the ages of 25 and 54. Read more to find out why this could have a significant benefit on the national workforce across Canada.
	
根据加拿大统计局的数据，“工作年龄人口\[在加拿大\] - 15 至 64 岁的人 - 从未如此老”。	According to Statistics Canada, “the working-age population \[in Canada\] — persons aged 15 to 64 — has never been older”.
	
### 加拿大的劳动人口发生了什么？	What’s happening with Canada’s working population?
	
事实上，在加拿大归类为工作年龄的人中，超过 20% 的人年龄在 55 至 64 岁之间，这表明他们已接近退休。谈到加拿大人口的普遍老龄化，重要的是要认识到，从 2016 年到 2021 年，15 岁以下儿童人数的增长速度比 65 岁及以上人口的增长速度慢六倍（总计600 万）。这一现实，以及 55 至 64 岁的工作人口比例（超过五分之一）代表了加拿大人口普查历史上的历史新高，表明加拿大的劳动力显然是老化。	In fact, more than 20% of people that Canada categorizes as being of working age are between the ages of 55 and 64, which suggests that they are close to retirement. To speak to the general aging of Canada’s population, it is important to realize that, from 2016 to 2021, the number of children under the age of 15 grew at a pace six times slower than the number of people aged 65 and older (total of 6.0 million). This reality, along with the fact that this 55-to-64-year-old proportion of the working population (over 1 in 5) represents an all-time high in the recorded history of the Canadian census, signals that Canada’s workforce is clearly aging.
	
更令人担忧的是，加拿大的生育率低于人口更替水平。目前全球人口更替水平为每名妇女生育 2.1 个孩子。继 2009 年以来持续的趋势之后，加拿大的生育率随着时间的推移稳步下降，在 2020 年创下了每名妇女生育 1.4 个孩子的历史新低。2020 年，加拿大也经历了自 2007 年以来最低的出生人数，并且同比增长最多自 1997 年以来，出生率逐年下降 (-3.6%)。随着分娩率的下降，普遍认为加拿大正趋向于加入生育率“最低”的国家行列（每位妇女生育 1.3 个或更少的孩子）。	Adding to this concern is the reality that Canada’s fertility rate is below the population replacement level. The current global population replacement level stands at 2.1 children per woman. Following a trend that has continued since 2009, Canada’s fertility rate has steadily declined over time, reaching a record low of 1.4 children per woman in 2020. In 2020, Canada also experienced the lowest number of births since 2007 and the greatest year-over-year decrease in births (-3.6%) since 1997. The prevailing idea that comes with this downward turn in childbirth is that Canada is trending towards joining the countries with the “lowest-low” fertility rates (1.3 or fewer children per woman).
	
总之，这些数据表明加拿大自然劳动力的未来可能会朝着次优的方向发展。加拿大统计局认为，这些现实可能会给劳动力市场带来更大的压力，并给全国的公共医疗保健和养老金体系带来更大的压力。因此，如果加拿大想要继续维持和发展其劳动力，现在就必须将目光投向其他地方。	Together, this data suggests that the future of Canada’s natural workforce could be headed in a suboptimal direction. Statistics Canada believes that these realities may put increased stress on the labour market as well as apply added pressure on public healthcare and pension systems across the country. Accordingly, Canada must now look to other places if the country wants to continue sustaining and growing its workforce.
	
值得庆幸的是，移民应该有助于实现这一目标，特别是由于加拿大最近的人口普查显示的趋势。	Thankfully, immigration should help with this goal, especially thanks to the trends revealed by Canada’s most recent census.
	
### 最近的移民如何帮助加拿大的劳动力？	How can recent immigration help Canada’s workforce?
	
根据 2021 年的人口普查数据，2016 年至 2021 年间，近三分之二的加拿大移民 (64.2%) 属于该国定义的核心工作年龄段（25 至 54 岁）。	According to 2021 census data, nearly two-thirds of Canada’s immigrants (64.2%) between 2016 and 2021 fell into the age range that this country defines as being of core working age (25 to 54 years old).
	
要了解加拿大对来到这个国家的技术工人年龄的重视，我们可以简单地看一下用于在快速入境移民系统中对申请人进行评分的综合排名系统（CRS）。	To understand the value that Canada places on the age of skilled workers coming to this country, we can simply take a look at the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) used to score applicants within the Express Entry immigration system.
	
CRS系统根据申请时的年龄为申请人提供不同的分数。 20-29 岁 (100) 岁的快速通道申请人可以获得最多的年龄分数。	The CRS system provides applicants with a different number of points depending on their age at the time of application. The most available points for age are given to Express Entry applicants aged 20-29 (100).
	
在 20 岁之前，17 岁或以下的候选人将获得 0 分，18 岁的候选人将获得 90 分，19 岁的候选人将获得 95 分。对于 30 岁或以上的候选人，年龄类别中的可用积分将逐步增加每年从给予 20-29 岁个人的 100 分开始减少。 30 岁时，候选人可获得 CRS 95 分。对于超过 30 岁的大多数额外年份，候选人每年会额外失去 5 分——31 岁时获得 90 分，32 岁时获得 85 分，33 岁时获得 80 分，依此类推。这在 40 岁（45 分）之后略有变化，每年总共减少 10 分——41 岁时获得 35 分，42 岁时获得 25 分，43 岁时获得 15 分——直到候选人 44 岁（5 分）。 45 岁或以上的候选人在年龄类别下获得 0 CRS 积分。	Prior to the age of 20, candidates receive 0 points if they are 17 or younger, 90 points if they are 18 years old and 95 points if they are 19. For candidates aged 30 or older, the points available in the age category will progressively decrease every year from the 100 points given out to individuals aged 20-29. At 30 years of age, candidates receive CRS 95 points. For most additional years past 30, candidates lose an extra five points per year — receiving 90 points at 31 years old, 85 points at 32, 80 points at 33 and so on. This slightly changes after the age of 40 (45 points), where there is a total 10-point decrease each year — receiving 35 points at 41 years old, 25 points at 42 and 15 points at 43 — until a candidate is 44 years old (5 points). Candidates aged 45 or older receive 0 CRS points under the age category.
	
考虑到现在有越来越多的移民在加拿大工作，尤其是与大流行前的水平相比，大多数新移民都处于核心工作年龄这一现实意味着他们可能成为加拿大未来劳动力发展的更大组成部分。移民已经成为加拿大劳动力增长的重要贡献者——占 2016 年至 2021 年劳动力增长的 79.9%——移民应该继续在加拿大作为一个国家的繁荣中发挥重要作用。	Considering that an increasing number of immigrants are now working in Canada, especially compared to pre-pandemic levels, the reality that most recent immigrants are of core working age means that they could be an even bigger part of Canada’s workforce development going forward. Having already been a strong contributor to the growth of Canada’s labour force — accounting for 79.9% of workforce growth between 2016 and 2021 — immigration should continue to play a large role in Canada’s prosperity as a nation.
	
处于核心工作年龄的新移民将能够在加拿大长期工作，从而为该国的劳动力和经济增长做出多年贡献。到 2021 年，加拿大的平均退休年龄将达到 64.4 岁，而且超过 20% 的加拿大新移民来到这个国家的年龄在 30 至 34 岁之间，因此可以合理地预计，他们将在近未来的时间里为加拿大的劳动力做出贡献三个十年。	Recent immigrants of core working age will be able to work in Canada for a long time, contributing to the country’s workforce and economic growth for many years as a result. With the average retirement age in Canada coming in at 64.4 years in 2021, and over 20% of Canada’s recent immigrants coming to this country between 30 and 34 years old, it can be reasonably expected that they will contribute to Canada’s workforce over nearly the next three decades.
	
因此，尽管自然人口老龄化和低出生率等全国趋势令人担忧，但由于移民和新移民来到加拿大的年龄，该国的劳动力似乎正走向更光明的未来。	Accordingly, despite worrisome national trends including an aging natural population and a low birthrate, this country’s workforce seems to be headed for a brighter future thanks to immigration and the age at which recent immigrants are coming to Canada.
