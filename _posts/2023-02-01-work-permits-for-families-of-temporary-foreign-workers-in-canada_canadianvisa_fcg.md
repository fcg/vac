加拿大已采取措施，通过采取一些临时措施来提高 2023 年的移民目标。其中最重要的措施之一是引入了一项新政策，允许临时外籍工人的家庭成员申请工作许可。	Canada has taken steps to increase immigration targets for 2023 by introducing a number of temporary measures. One of the most significant of these measures is the introduction of a new policy that allows family members of temporary foreign workers to apply for work permits.
	
新政策	The New Policy
	
根据新政策，在加拿大受雇至少一年并持有有效工作许可的临时外国工人可以为其配偶、同居伴侣和受抚养子女申请开放式工作许可。开放式工作许可证将允许家庭成员在加拿大工作长达两年。	Under the new policy, temporary foreign workers who have been employed in Canada for at least one year and who have valid work permits can apply for open work permits for their spouses, common-law partners and dependent children. The open work permits will allow the family members to work in Canada for up to two years.
	
新政策于 1 月 30 日开始实施，是联邦政府应对经济移民增加的一部分。它旨在帮助家庭在大流行后维持收入。	The new policy commenced on January 30th and is part of the federal government’s response to increasing economic immigration. It is intended to help families maintain their incomes post-pandemic.
	
此举也被视为支持加拿大经济的一种方式，因为它允许更多人为劳动力市场做出贡献。这可能有助于减少大流行对经济的影响，并确保该国的经济在此期间保持强劲。	The move is also seen as a way to support the Canadian economy, as it allows more people to contribute to the labour market. This could help to reduce the economic impact of the pandemic and ensure that the country’s economy remains strong during this period.
	
除了开放工签外，新政策还允许家庭成员申请学习许可，这将允许他们在加拿大继续深造。这不仅可以提供宝贵的教育机会，还有助于在未来吸引高技能的外国工人到加拿大。	In addition to the open work permits, the new policy also allows family members to apply for study permits, which will allow them to pursue studies in Canada. This will not only provide valuable education opportunities, but it could also help to attract highly-skilled foreign workers to Canada in the future.
	
新政策是一个积极的步骤，可以帮助确保临时外国工人及其家人在大流行期间能够留在加拿大。这是对这些工人对加拿大经济做出的重大贡献以及他们在过去一年中所面临的困难的认可。该政策的效果如何还有待观察，但这无疑是一个受欢迎的举措。	The new policy is a positive step that could help to ensure that temporary foreign workers and their families are able to remain in Canada during the pandemic. It is a recognition of the significant contributions that these workers have made to the Canadian economy, and of the hardship that they have faced over the past year. It remains to be seen how effective the policy will be, but it is certainly a welcomed move.
	
分阶段实施	Implementation in Phases
	
加拿大政府宣布了一项新的临时措施，将分三个阶段实施，以确保其成功执行。截至目前，第二和第三阶段的日期尚未公布。	The Canadian government has announced a new temporary measure which will be implemented in three phases in order to ensure its successful execution. As of now, the dates for the second and third phases have not yet been revealed.
	
根据临时外国工人计划或国际流动计划的高薪移民抵达加拿大的工人的家庭成员将能够在第一阶段申请开放式工作许可。	Family members of workers arriving to Canada under the high-wage stream of the Temporary Foreign Worker Program or the International Mobility Program will be able to apply for an open work permit in Phase One.
	
经过一系列讨论后，第二阶段将包括扩大政策范围，将来自临时外国工人计划的低工资流的雇员的家庭成员包括在内。	Following a series of discussions, Phase Two will include an extension of the policy to include family members of employees from the low-wage stream of the Temporary Foreign Worker Program.
	
第三阶段将涉及与农业合作伙伴和利益相关者的进一步磋商，以评估将该措施扩大到农业工人家庭成员的操作可行性。	Phase Three will involve further consultation with agricultural partners and stakeholders to evaluate the operational feasibility of the measure's expansion to the family members of agricultural workers.
	
什么是临时外国工人的配偶和受抚养子女的开放式工作许可证？	What is an Open Work Permit for Spouses and Dependent Children of Temporary Foreign Workers?
	
在加拿大，允许临时外国工人携带他们的配偶和受抚养子女。这取决于某些条件，并且需要家庭成员获得开放式工作许可证 (OWP)。 OWP 允许临时外国工人的家人在加拿大生活、工作和学习。	In Canada, temporary foreign workers are allowed to bring their spouses and dependent children with them. This is subject to certain conditions and requires the family members to obtain an Open Work Permit (OWP). An OWP allows the family of temporary foreign workers to live, work, and study in Canada.
	
要获得 OWP 的资格，外国工人必须持有有效的工作许可证并在加拿大全职工作。 OWP 的有效期与外国工人的工作许可证的有效期相同。家庭成员还必须满足某些其他要求，例如健康和安全检查。	To be eligible for an OWP, the foreign worker must have a valid work permit and be working in Canada full-time. The OWP will be valid for the same period as the foreign worker’s work permit. The family members must also satisfy certain other requirements, such as health and security checks.
	
一旦签发 OWP，持有人可以在加拿大从事任何职业并为任何雇主工作。外国工人的家庭成员在加拿大期间也可以申请学习许可。	Once an OWP has been issued, the holder can work in any occupation and for any employer in Canada. The family members of the foreign worker can also apply for a study permit while they are in Canada.
	
OWP 还允许外国工人在其家人留在加拿大期间暂时离开加拿大。该许可证在外籍工人工作许可的整个期限内有效，无论外籍工人在加拿大停留了多长时间。	The OWP also allows foreign workers to leave Canada temporarily while their family members remain in the country. The permit is valid for the entire period of the foreign worker’s work permit, regardless of how much time the foreign worker spends in Canada.
	
对于想要在加拿大工作和生活的临时外国工人的家庭来说，单程证是一个很好的选择。该许可证允许家庭成员在加拿大工作、学习和旅行，而无需获得单独的工作或学习许可证。这对希望雇用外国工人及其家人的雇主也有好处，因为它简化了获得必要许可证的过程。	The OWP is a great option for families of temporary foreign workers who want to work and live in Canada. The permit allows the family members to work, study, and travel in Canada without having to obtain a separate work or study permit. It is also beneficial to employers looking to hire foreign workers and their families, as it simplifies obtaining the necessary permits.
