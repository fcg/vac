介绍：	Introduction:
	
加拿大税务局 (CRA) 负责征税和执行税法，但不幸的是，骗子经常利用 CRA 的名义和声誉来诱骗人们交出他们的钱财或个人信息。这些诈骗可以采取多种形式，从虚假电话到网络钓鱼电子邮件。在这篇博文中，我们将探讨一些最常见的 CRA 骗局，并分享有关如何保护自己的技巧。	The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) is responsible for collecting taxes and administering tax laws, but unfortunately, scammers often use the CRA’s name and reputation to trick people into giving away their money or personal information. These scams can take many forms, from fake phone calls to phishing emails. In this blog post, we’ll explore some of the most common CRA scams and share tips on how to protect yourself.
	
假电话：	Fake Phone Calls:
	
最常见的 CRA 诈骗之一是假电话。这些是假装来自 CRA 的个人打来的电话，他们要求立即支付假定的税款。如果不立即支付假定的债务，他们还可能威胁要逮捕或采取法律行动。 CRA 绝不会通过电话要求立即付款，也绝不会威胁逮捕或采取法律行动。如果您接到这样的电话，请挂断并向 CRA 和加拿大反欺诈中心报告。	One of the most common CRA scams is fake phone calls. These are calls from individuals pretending to be from the CRA, who demand immediate payment of a supposed tax debt. They may also threaten arrest or legal action if the supposed debt is not paid immediately. The CRA will never demand immediate payment over the phone and will never threaten arrest or legal action. If you receive a call like this, hang up and report it to the CRA and the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre.
	
网络钓鱼诈骗：	Phishing Scams:
	
网络钓鱼诈骗是 CRA 诈骗的另一种常见形式。这些是伪造的电子邮件或消息，看起来像是来自 CRA，但实际上它们来自试图窃取您的个人信息的诈骗者。他们可能会询问您的个人信息，例如您的社会保险号、信用卡号或网上银行登录凭据。 CRA 绝不会通过电子邮件或短信索取个人信息。如果您收到这样的电子邮件或消息，请不要点击任何链接或输入任何信息并将其报告给 CRA 和加拿大反欺诈中心。	Phishing scams are another common form of CRA scam. These are fake emails or messages that are designed to look like they are from the CRA, but they are actually from scammers trying to steal your personal information. They may ask for your personal information such as your social insurance number, credit card numbers, or online banking login credentials. The CRA will never ask for personal information through email or text message. If you receive an email or message like this, do not click on any links or enter any information and report it to the CRA and the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre.
	
虚假网站：	Fake Websites:
	
另一个需要注意的骗局是冒充 CRA 的虚假网站。这些网站可能看起来像 CRA 官方网站，但它们旨在窃取您的个人信息。为避免成为此骗局的受害者，请始终确保您访问的是 CRA 官方网站，方法是直接在浏览器中输入网址或使用您保存的书签。	Another scam to be aware of is fake websites that impersonate the CRA. These websites may look like the official CRA website, but they are designed to steal your personal information. To avoid falling victim to this scam, always ensure that you are on the official CRA website by typing the web address directly into your browser or by using a bookmark that you have saved.
	
结论：	Conclusion:
	
CRA 在征税和执行税法方面发挥着重要作用，但重要的是要注意使用 CRA 的名义诱骗人们交出他们的钱或个人信息的骗局。通过了解最常见的 CRA 骗局并采取措施保护自己，您可以避免成为欺诈的受害者。	The CRA plays an important role in collecting taxes and administering tax laws, but it’s important to be aware of the scams that use the CRA’s name to trick people into giving away their money or personal information. By being aware of the most common CRA scams and taking steps to protect yourself, you can avoid becoming a victim of fraud.
	
如果您收到怀疑是骗局的电话、电子邮件、短信或访问的网站，请不要透露任何个人信息，并将其报告给 CRA 和加拿大反欺诈中心。	If you receive a phone call, email, text message or visit a website that you suspect to be a scam, do not give out any personal information and report it to the CRA and the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre.
	
通过遵循这些提示，您可以保护自己免受 CRA 诈骗并确保您的个人信息安全。	By following these tips, you can protect yourself from CRA scams and ensure that your personal information remains safe.
