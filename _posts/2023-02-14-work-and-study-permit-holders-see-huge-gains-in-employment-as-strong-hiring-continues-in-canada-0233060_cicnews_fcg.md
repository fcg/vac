工作和学习许可证持有人看到了就业的巨大增长，因为加拿大持续强劲的招聘 2023 年开始于多个行业和五个省的大幅增长。	Work and Study Permit holders see huge gains in employment, as strong hiring continues in Canada 2023 begins with substantial growth in several industries, and across five provinces.
	
1 月份整体就业人数大幅增加，2023 年第一个月全加拿大新增 150,000 个工作岗位（占总就业人数的 5%）。	January saw a considerable increase in overall employment, as 150,000 jobs (+5% of total employment) across Canada were filled in the first month of 2023.

招聘人数的强劲增长导致许多群体（主要是 25-54 岁的工人）的就业人数大幅增加，非永久居民 (NPR)（持有学习或工作许可的人）的劳动力参与度显着增加。	The strong surge in hiring yielded big increases in employment for many groups (primarily workers aged 25-54), with Non-permanent Residents (NPRs)—those holding either a Study or Work Permit)—seeing significant increases in labour force engagement.
	
全国失业率保持在5%的历史低位；与 2022 年 12 月相比变化不大。到 2022 年底，加拿大移民的平均失业率为 5.96%，反映出加拿大就业机会丰富。	The national unemployment rate held at a historically low 5%; little changed from December 2022. Immigrants in Canada held an average unemployment rate of 5.96% at the end of 2022, reflecting the wealth of job opportunities in Canada.
	
一月份，NPR 填补了 79,000 个职位。截至 2023 年 11 月，持有有效学习许可的加拿大国际学生现在可以在学期内无限期地工作，直到 2023 年 12 月 31 日——这可能是造成这一增长的一个因素。再加上现在占加拿大人口比例最大的 NPR（根据最新的 [人口普查数据]），他们现在也有创纪录的劳动力参与率。	In January, NPRs filled 79,000 positions. As of November 2023, international students in Canada who hold a valid study permit can now work an unlimited number of hours during school semesters, until December 31st, 2023—likely a contributor to this increase. In conjunction with NPRs now making up the biggest proportion of Canada’s population ever.

### NPR 受雇于哪些行业？	What industries were NPRs hired in?
	
NPR 就业人数的增加反映在多个领域。涨幅最大的行业是：	The increases in NPR employment were reflected in multiple areas. The industries that saw the greatest increases were:
	
* 专业、科学和技术服务（雇佣了 10,349 人）；	  Professional, scientific, and technical services (+10,349 people hired);
* 零售贸易（雇用了 +9,717 人）；	  Retail trade (+9,717 people hired);
* 住宿和餐饮服务（雇用 +8,848 人）；和	  Accommodation and food services (+8,848 people hired); and
* 医疗保健和社会援助（+7742 人受聘）。	  Health care and social assistance (+7742 people hired).
	
总体而言，这一群体现在占总就业人数的 3.4%，这表明他们对加拿大劳动力市场很重要。 11 月份的职位空缺报告（撰写本文时的最新报告）显示总体职位空缺逐渐减少，但上述三个行业（不包括零售业）的空缺职位数量继续增加，并且对工人的需求持续存在。	Overall, this group now makes up 3.4% of total employment, underlying their importance to the Canadian labour market. November’s job vacancy report (the latest report at the time of writing) showed a gradual decrease in overall vacancies, however three of the above industries (excluding retail trade) continue to have an elevated number of open positions, and a persistent need for workers.
	
### 哪些行业在 1 月份出现了强劲的招聘增长，这些行业还有工作吗？	What industries saw strong hiring gains in January, and are there still jobs in these industries?
	
2023 年第一个月，以下领域的招聘人数强劲增长：	The first month of 2023 saw strong hiring gains in the:
	
* 批发和零售业（填补了 59,000 个职位，共招聘 128,960 个职位空缺）；	  Wholesale and retail trade (59,000 jobs filled, hiring for 128,960 vacancies collectively);
* 医疗保健和社会援助（填补了 40,000 个职位，招聘 131,775 个职位空缺）；	  Health care and social assistance (40,000 jobs filled, hiring for 131,775 vacancies);
* 教育服务（填补了 18,000 个职位，招聘 20,180 个职位空缺）；	  Educational services (18,000 jobs filled, hiring for 20,180 vacancies);
* 建筑业（填补了 16,000 个职位，招聘 79,025 个职位空缺）；和	  Construction (16,000 jobs filled, hiring for 79,025 vacancies); and
* 其他服务（填补了 16,000 个职位，招聘 34,985 个职位空缺）。	  Other services (16,000 jobs filled, hiring for 34,985 vacancies).
	
此外，就业人数减少了 [17,000 个职位](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/230210/dq230210a-eng.htm?CMP=mstatcan#:~:text=At%20the%20same %20time%2C%20employment%20declined%20in%20transportation%20and%20warehousing%20(%2D17%2C000%3B%20%2D1.7%25.)在运输和仓储行业，目前正在招聘46,635个职位空缺。加拿大工人现在的全国平均工资为每小时 33.01 加元——但是加拿大的平均购买力受到了打击，因为工资增长仍然低于加拿大央行 2 月初加息所带来的通胀压力。	Additionally, employment decreased by [17,000 positions](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/230210/dq230210a-eng.htm?CMP=mstatcan#:~:text=At%20the%20same%20time%2C%20employment%20declined%20in%20transportation%20and%20warehousing%20(%2D17%2C000%3B%20%2D1.7%25).) in the transportation and warehousing industry, currently hiring for 46,635 vacancies. Workers in Canada now hold a national average wage of $33.01 CAD/hour—however average purchasing power has taken a hit in Canada, as wage growth remains slower than increasing inflationary pressures seen with the Bank of Canada raising interest rates at the start of February.
	
**请注意，所有职位空缺数据均取自 2022 年 11 月的职位空缺报告，并根据季节性因素进行了调整。**	**Note that all vacancy figures are taken from the November 2022 job vacancy report and adjusted for seasonality.**
	
上述许多行业都报告了紧迫且持续的职位空缺。例如，建筑业是 11 月份职位空缺增加的少数几个行业之一。与此同时，缺乏医护人员仍然是加拿大关注的问题，因为该国试图填补自 COVID-19 大流行开始以来一直困扰该行业的持续劳动力短缺问题。	Many of the above industries report pressing and continuous job vacancies. For example, construction was one of the few industries that saw an increase in vacancies in November. Meanwhile a lack of healthcare workers continues to be a concern for Canada, as the country seeks to fill the persistent labour shortages that have plagued this industry since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.
	
这种情况的严重性反映在政府所做的政策变化中。移民占加拿大劳动力增长的近100%；因此，加拿大使临时外国医护人员更容易移民和在加拿大工作——将这些措施也扩展到护理人员试点项目的工作人员。与此同时，加拿大扩大了对无身份建筑工人的移民选择，以最大限度地增加本国劳动力。	The gravity of this situation is reflected in policy changes the government has made. Immigration accounts for nearly 100% of growth in the Canadian labour force; and as such Canada has made it easier for temporary foreign health care workers to immigrate and work in Canada—extending these measures to workers in caregiver pilot programs as well. In parallel Canada has extended immigration options for out-of-status construction workers, in a bid to maximize its workforce at home.
	
### 哪些省份的招聘人数增幅最大？	Which provinces saw the greatest increases in hiring?
	
一月份，招聘人数增幅最大的省份包括：	In January, the provinces that experienced the greatest increases in hiring included:
	
* 安大略省（+63,000 个职位已填补）；	  Ontario (+63,000 positions filled);
* 魁北克（已填补+47,000 个职位）；	  Quebec (+47,000 positions filled);
* 艾伯塔省（+21,000 个职位已填补）；	  Alberta (+21,000 positions filled);
* 新斯科舍省（+9,400 个职位已填补）；和	  Nova Scotia (+9,400 positions filled); and
* 萨斯喀彻温省（已填补 4,500 个职位）。	  Saskatchewan (4,500 positions filled).
	
相比之下，纽芬兰和拉布拉多的职位空缺有所增加，因为就业岗位减少了 2,300 个。各省通过省提名计划 (PNP) 解决其特定的劳动力短缺问题——如今这是经济移民到加拿大的主要途径。	In contrast Newfoundland and Labrador saw an increase in job vacancies as employment decreased by 2,300 positions. Provinces address their specific labour shortages through the Provincial Nominee Programs (PNPs)—which today are the main pathway of economic immigration to Canada.
	
随着时间的推移，每个省的职位空缺、特定的需求职业和招聘将有助于确定其 PNP 的具体情况。事实上，基于快速通道的项目也在朝着有针对性的抽签方向发展，需求职业是根据该政策获得有针对性的申请邀请 (ITA) 的关键考虑因素之一。	As the year progresses, job vacancies, specific in-demand occupations, and hiring in each province will help determine the specifics of their PNPs. In fact, Express Entry based programs are also moving towards targeted draws, with in-demand professions being one of the key considerations towards receiving a targeted invitation to apply (ITA) under this policy.
