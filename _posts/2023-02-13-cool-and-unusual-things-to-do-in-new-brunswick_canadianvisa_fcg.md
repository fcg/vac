!在新不伦瑞克省要做的 10 件很酷和不寻常的事情	!10 Cool and Unusual Things to Do in New Brunswick
	
您是否正在考虑在不久的将来移居或访问加拿大，但不确定要在哪个省定居？有 10 个省和 3 个地区，每个地区都有自己的省级立法政府、文化和经济动态，因此很难决定选择哪个省。	Are you thinking of moving or visiting Canada in the near future but are not sure about which province you want to settle in? With 10 provinces and 3 territories, each with their own provincial legislative governments, culture and economic dynamics it can be very difficult to decide which province to choose.
	
加拿大幅员辽阔（9,093,507 平方公里），使其成为世界上陆地总面积第二大的国家，这意味着每个地区和/或省份都相隔很远。	Canada’s immense size (9,093,507 square kilometers) which makes it the second largest country in the world on the basis of total landmass means that each region and/or province is separated from others by large distances.
	
这导致了独特的社会文化传统和生活方式的发展。例如，新不伦瑞克省、纽芬兰省和拉布拉多省、新斯科舍省和爱德华王子岛等大西洋省份的海洋文化与加拿大其他地区截然不同，这种文化在这些省份的经济、社会和生活方式传统中普遍存在。	This results in the development of distinct socio-cultural traditions and lifestyles. For example, the Atlantic provinces of New Brunswick,NewFoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island have a distinctly maritime culture from the rest of Canada which pervades and is prevalent in these provinces' economy, social and lifestyle traditions
	
与此同时，大西洋各省距离遥远且彼此分离，以至于它们在消遣、建筑偏好、经济、健康和教育方面形成了自己独特的方面。	At the same time the Atlantic provinces are distant and separate enough from each other enough that they’ve developed their own unique aspects with regards to pastimes, architectural preferences, economy, health and education.
	
这更加强调搬到加拿大某个特定省份的决定，因为您搬到的省份将为您提供与其他省份完全不同的体验生活方式。	This puts more emphasis on the decision to move to a particular Canadian province because the province you move to will offer you aspects of a completely different experiential lifestyle than others.
	
考虑到这一点，我们想推荐新不伦瑞克作为您的加拿大移民目的地。它坐落在加拿大大西洋沿岸及其周边地区，既拥有加拿大小镇的古朴品质，又拥有加拿大一些人口较多社区的无限城市活力。以下概述了在新不伦瑞克可以做的一些很酷和不寻常的事情。	With this in mind, we would like to recommend New Brunswick as your Canadian immigration destination. Nestled in and around Atlantic Canada, it possesses both the quaint qualities of small-town Canada and boundless urban energy of some of Canada’s more populous communities. The following is an outline of some of the cool and unusual things to do in New Brunswick.

!新不伦瑞克的不寻常事物	!unusual things in New Brunswick
	
### 合和角	Hopewell Cape
	
合和岩是合和角沿线的一系列巨大的潮汐岩层。这些地层经过数千年的雕刻，形成了现在的几何形状。它靠近大海，已成为进出境游客在海滩嬉戏的同时凝视其古老物质基础的巨大吸引力。	Hopewell Rocks is a series of gigantic tidal rock formations along Hopewell Cape. The formations were carved over thousands of years into their present geometric shapes. Nestled close to the sea, it has become a huge attraction for inbound and outbound tourists looking to gaze at its ancient material foundations while frolicking along the beach.
	
合和岩是新不伦瑞克最受欢迎的旅游景点之一。就像安大略省拥有尼亚加拉大瀑布这种吸引加拿大人和全世界的自然现象一样，霍普韦尔岩石在新不伦瑞克省也发挥着同样的作用。	Hopewell Rocks is one of the most popular tourist draws for New Brunswick. Much like Ontario has Niagara Falls as the natural phenomenon that has captivated both Canadians and the world, Hopewell Rocks performs the same function for the province of New Brunswick.
	
我们建议在夏季访问霍普威尔角，因为潮汐和天气都处于最平静的状态，可以不间断地进入岩石，这样您就可以在阳光或月光下见证它们在全盛时期的风采。	We recommend visiting Hopewell Cape during summer as both the tidal waves and the weather is at its most calm, allowing uninterrupted access to the rocks so you can bear witness to them in their full glory weather in the sunlight or moonlight.
	
### 蒙克顿，磁山	Moncton, Magnetic Hill
	
蒙克顿的磁山不仅在新不伦瑞克省，而且在整个加拿大都是最不寻常的地方之一。 80多年来，它一直困扰着当地居民。在一条小车道上，二十世纪三十年代，当汽车首次普及到大众时，经过这条小路的司机开始注意到小山上发生的一件奇怪的事情。	Magnetic Hill in Moncton is one of the most unusual places not only in the province of New Brunswick but in Canada as a whole. For over 80 years it has baffled the local residents. On a little cart path, back in the the twentieth centuries ‘30s, when automobiles first became widely available to the mass public, drivers who passed this path began to notice a strange occurrence on the small hill.
	
当司机将脚从车轮底部的汽车制动器上移开时，他们注意到发生了一些奇怪的事情，那就是他们的汽车开始向后滚动上山。多年来，人们一直在猜测这种现象的来源：从鬼魂到外星人，各种奇怪的猜测比比皆是。	When drivers took their feet off the car brake at the bottom of the wheel, they noticed something strange happen which was that their cars began to roll backwards up the hill. People have posited for years about what the source of the phenomenon could be: from ghosts to aliens, all manner of strange speculation abounds.
	
然而，这种现象有一个物理科学依据，即一种称为“重力山”的视错觉。对于这种物理现象，看似上坡的坡度实际上是下坡坡度的组成部分，由于斜坡的位置和地平线的视野很小甚至看不到，我们的大脑会误解它。	However, there is a physical scientific basis for this phenomenon which is an optical illusion called “gravity hill”. For this physical phenomenon, what appears to be an uphill incline is actually a component of a downhill incline which our brains misinterpret because of the situational location of the slopes and the little to no view of the horizon.
	
如果你对在不久的将来体验这座磁力山感到好奇，那就有机会去蒙克顿看看，体验一下这一生一次的奇观吧。	If you’re curious about experiencing this magnetic hill in the near future, then take a visit to Moncton when you have the opportunity and experience this once in a lifetime oddity.
	
### 哈特兰大桥，新不伦瑞克省	Hartland Bridge, New Brunswick
	
哈特兰桥是哈特兰镇的一座有盖木桥。它完全由木头制成，长 1,282 英尺，被称为世界上最长的廊桥，也以其古朴的美丽而闻名。	Hartland Bridge is a covered wooden bridge in the town of Hartland. Completely made out of wood and at a length of 1,282 feet it is known as the world’s longest covered bridge and also renowned for its quaint beauty.
	
它的长度作为一种独特的新颖性已成为旅游景点的热门来源，然而，它也经常引起游客的大量评论，认为它是幽闭恐惧症的根源。	Its length has become a popular source of tourist attraction as a unique novelty, however, it is also often the generator of lots of comments among visitors who felt that it was a source of claustrophobia.
	
这座桥建于 1901 年，是横跨圣约翰河的第一种不涉及船只的交通方式。目前，为了满足越来越多前来观桥的游客，桥边修建了人行步道。	Built in 1901, the bridge was the first mode of transportation across the St John river not involving a boat. At present, in order to accommodate the growing numbers of tourists who come to sate their curiosity by observing the bridge, a pedestrian walkway that runs alongside the bridge was built.
	
### 反转瀑布	Reversing Falls
	
在新不伦瑞克省圣约翰芬迪的一个地方，坐落着雄伟的倒车瀑布。瀑布受到当地潮汐巨大力量的影响，导致它们每天多次改变水域的走向。	In a spot of the Fundy in St John, New Brunswick lies the majestic Reversing Falls. The falls are under the influence of the immense power of the local tides which cause them to change the course of the waters multiple times per day.
	
芬迪湾的涨潮和退潮之间的潮汐高达 16 米，是世界上潮汐最高的地区之一。芬迪湾潮汐是昼夜潮汐，这意味着潮汐大约每 12 小时涨落一次。如果您有幸在涨潮和退潮时参观瀑布，那么您将有绝佳的机会观察这些惊人的潮汐变化。	With variable tides of 16 meters between high and low tides, the Bay of Fundy is one of the highest tides in the world. The Bay of Fundy tides are diurnal, which means that the tides rise and fall about once every twelve hours. Should you be lucky enough to visit the Falls at high and low tide, then you will be presented with the perfect opportunity to observe these phenomenal tidal shifts.
	
作为倒车瀑布高湍流的直接后果，大多数船只和小型航海船只都明智地避开了震中，尽管众所周知有时船只会把游客带到危险的地方靠近汹涌的中心。	As a direct consequence of the high turbulence of the Reversing Falls, most boats and small seafaring vessels wisely steer clear of the epicenter although sometimes boats have been known to bring visitors perilously close to the roiling center.
	
### 世界上最大的龙虾	World’s Largest Lobster
	
在古色古香的小镇希迪亚克 (Shediac)，新不伦瑞克 (New Brunswick)，坐落着一座玻璃纤维、钢筋和混凝土结构，巧妙地塑造成一只巨大的龙虾。龙虾站在镇内的位置上放哨，并作为纪念给予该镇“世界龙虾之都”的流行绰号的一种方式。	In the quaint small town of Shediac, New Brunswick, lies a fiberglass, steel and concrete structure skillfully shaped into the form of a gigantic lobster. The lobster stands sentry over its location within the town and was installed as means to commemorate the popular moniker given to the town of, “Lobster Capital of the World”.
	
龙虾雕像类似于 B 级电影的景点，除了与城镇相关的有意义的象征意义外，它还可以作为吉祥物和栩栩如生的怪物形象。这座雕像建于 1989 年。它坐落在一块大而平坦的混凝土石板上，长 35 英尺。	The Lobster statue is akin to a B-movie attraction and besides the meaningfully symbolic of its installation in relation to the town, it also functions as a mascot and a vision of a monster brought to life. The statue was built in 1989. It sits on top of a large, flat concrete slab of stone and is 35 feet long.
	
它位于小镇的入口处，一目了然，进出小镇的人永远不会忘记它的恐怖面貌。作为一座公共纪念碑，它向公众开放，公众可以爬上它的石头底座拍照。	It is situated at the entrance to the town and is in plain sight so those entering or exiting the town may never forget its terrifying visage. As a public monument, it is open to the public who can scale its stone plinth in order to take a picture.
	
如果您喜欢有趣的路边景点、核怪兽的恐怖景象或只想幻想大龙虾满足自己的胃口，那么我们强烈建议您前往希迪亚克 (Shediac) 看看世界上最大的龙虾。	For anyone who enjoys fun roadside attractions, terrifying visions of nuclear monstrosities or just wants to fantasize about satisfying their appetite on a huge lobster, then we highly recommend paying a visit to Shediac to see the world's largest lobster.
	
### 部长岛	Ministers Island
	
在新不伦瑞克省的圣安德鲁斯，有一个岛屿横跨狭窄的海湾地带，为路边的游客提供了驾车穿越海底的机会。退潮时，海水退去的程度如此之高，以至于出现了一块薄薄的海底板。	In Saint Andrews, New Brunswick, there is an island across the narrow strip of bay that offers roadside visitors an opportunity to drive across the ocean floor. During low tide the waters recede to such a high degree that a thin piece of slab of the ocean floor appears.
	
这块可见的海底被称为酒吧路。凭借灵巧、专业的驾驶，可以从狭窄的海滨穿越到被称为部长岛的岛屿。然而，在涨潮时，水位上升并淹没了整个 Bar Road，切断了进出 Ministers Island 的通道。	This piece of visible ocean floor is called the bar road. With deft, expert driving it becomes possible to cross from narrow beachfront to the island, which is called Ministers island. However, during high tide, the waters rise and cover up the entirety of Bar Road, cutting off access to and from Ministers Island.
	
部长岛及其连接的巴尔路静脉非常受徒步旅行者的欢迎，他们喜欢穿越其众多小径并在周围水域中涉水。请注意，任何在涨潮期间将汽车留在岛上的游客都面临着离开汽车并不得不等到第二天早上去取车并开车回家的风险。	Minister’s Island and its connecting vein of the Bar Road is very popular with hikers who like to travel through its many trails and wade around and through the surrounding waters. Please note that any visitor who leaves their car on the island during high tide runs the risk of leaving their car and having to wait until morning the next day to go collect it and drive home.
	
### Nackawic，新不伦瑞克省	Nackawic, New Brunswick
	
在新不伦瑞克省的 Nackawic 镇，有一把带刀柄的斧头半埋在周围的分层石基座中。这把斧头的轴高约 50 英尺，由 50 吨实心钢制成，被誉为世界上最大的斧头。	In the town of Nackawic, New Brunswick, lies an ax that has a bladed haft is half-way buried into the surrounding tiered stone plinth. With a shaft that rises about 50 feet into the air and made of 50 tons of solid steel, the ax is popularly known as the largest ax in the world.
	
这把斧头被安装为纪念该镇木材和林业的重要性的纪念碑。该工具创建于 1991 年，还怀旧地强调了昔日伐木工人辛勤生活的历史和遗产。	The ax was installed as a commemorative monument that celebrates the importance of the town's lumber and forestry industry. Created in 1991, the tool also puts nostalgic emphasis on the history of the industrious lives and legacy of the lumberjacks of yesteryear.
	
在巨大结构安装的同年，它被授予加拿大林业之都的称号。为子孙后代着想，斧头里藏着一个胶囊，留在那里留给后代去发现。围绕着斧头的宽阔、粗短的底座偶尔会举办音乐和戏剧表演。	During the same year of the colossal structure’s installation it was awarded the moniker of the Forestry Capital of Canada. With the thought of future generations in mind, there is a capsule hidden in the axhead that was left in there for those future generations to discover. The wide, stumpy plinth surrounding the ax occasionally plays host to musical and theater performances.
	
### 鹧鸪岛检疫站	Partridge Island Quarantine Site
	
在 19 世纪，由于马铃薯饥荒导致爱尔兰移民到新世界的高峰期，许多来到加拿大并登陆加拿大大西洋的爱尔兰移民将在新不伦瑞克省的圣约翰首次登陆。最著名的移民站之一位于帕特里奇岛，称为帕特里奇岛检疫站	During the 19th century, at the height of the great Irish migration to the New World resulting from the potato famine, a lot of Irish immigrants who came to Canada and landed across Atlantic Canada would have made the first landfall at Saint John, New Brunswick. One of the most famous immigration stations was located on Partridge Island, called the Partridge Island Quarantine Site
	
由于该站仍牢牢掌握在国家军方手中，因此很难进入该站点。然而，省政府最近放宽了限制，允许那些获得书面许可通过预约参观的人可以进入并见证该遗址令人难以置信的复杂定居历史，该历史可追溯到 17 世纪中叶。	With the station still firmly in the hands of the nation's military, it can be difficult to gain access to the site. However, the provincial government has recently loosened restrictions and allows those given documented permission to visit via appointment can gain access and bear witness to the site's incredible and complicated history of settlement that stretches back to the mid 17th century.
	
### 坎波贝洛岛	Campobello Island
	
坎波贝洛岛位于美国缅因州附近。距缅因州尖端四分之一英里的确切距离是威尔士浦，它位于国际边界上，但也正好穿过一个时区。	Situated close to the U.S. state of Maine lies Campobello Island. At the exact distance of a quarter mile from the tip of the state of Maine is Welshpool which rests on the international border but also crosses right through a time zone.
	
这个与世隔绝的地方有一座灯塔，是美国最受赞誉的总统之一富兰克林·德拉诺·罗斯福 (Franklin Delano Roosevelt) 休息和放松的著名场所。	The isolated locale that has a lighthouse on its grounds was a famous location for rest and relaxation of one of America’s most popularly lauded presidents: Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
	
由于与美国著名总统威尔士浦的这种联系，坎波内洛已成为富人休闲的好去处。如果您有兴趣了解从 19 世纪末的镀金时代开始的富人和休闲的历史，坎波贝洛岛威尔士浦就是您的最佳选择。	As a consequence of this association with a famous American president, Welshpool, Camponello has become famous as a location for leisure among the rich. Should you be interested in learning about history of the rich and leisure beginning with the Gilded Age of the late 19th century, Welshpool, Campobello Island is just the place for you.
	
### 卡尔顿山	Mount Carleton
	
卡尔顿山 (Mount Carleton) 高 817 米（2,680 英尺），耸立在新不伦瑞克 (New Brunswick) 周围的乡村之上。卡尔顿山是圣母院山脉中的一座山峰，它本身就是从绿山到佛蒙特州的阿巴拉契亚山脉中的一个山脉。	At a height of 817 meters (2,680 feet) Mount Carleton towers over the surrounding New Brunswick countryside. Mount Carleton is a peak within the Notre Dame Mountains, which is itself a range within the Appalachian mountains which run from the Green Mountains to Vermont.
	
由 4 亿年的火山岩制成，在那段时间里，经过元素的无情撞击，火山岩被风化成现在的柔软形状。如果您是一位寻求新挑战的登山爱好者，那么我们推荐卡尔顿山作为任何想要测试自己勇气的人的一项有价值且持久的耐力测试。	Made of 400 million years of volcanic rock which over the course of that time was weathered into its current soft form through the relentless bashing of the elements. If you’re a mountain hiking enthusiast looking for a new challenge, then we recommend Mount Carleton as a worthy and durable test of endurance for anyone looking to test their mettle.
