凌晨 3 点 36 分，斯特拉斯莫尔皇家骑警接到 Ridge Road 赫斯基加油站服务员打来的 911 报警电话。服务员告诉警方，店内有一名情绪激动的男子不肯离开。At 3:36 a.m., Strathmore RCMP received a 911 call from the attendant at the Husky gas station on Ridge Road. The attendant told police that there was an agitated man inside the store who would not leave.

正如商店内的监控录像所示，两名警察于凌晨 3 点 43 分到达并与该男子交谈。该男子仍留在店内，凌晨 4 点 20 分，警察试图逮捕他。这名男子和两名警官扭打起来，警官们对他使用了传导能量武器。警察随后离开商店等待支援。该男子留在里面并开始自残并损坏商店及其物品。此时，服务员已经离开店内，没有生命危险。As shown on the surveillance video inside the store, two officers arrived at 3:43 a.m. and spoke to the man. The man remained inside the store and, at 4:20 a.m., the officers tried to arrest him. The man and the two officers struggled, and the officers used their conducted energy weapons on him. The officers then left the store to await backup. The man remained inside and began to self-harm and damage the store and its contents. By this time, the attendant had left the store and was not in danger.

凌晨 4 点 38 分，这名男子带着一把锤子和一根手杖离开了商店，并用其中一个物品撞上了一辆有标记的加拿大皇家骑警车辆。警察向这名男子喷了胡椒喷雾，然后他又回到了商店。At 4:38 a.m., the man left the store, carrying a hammer and a walking cane, and hit a marked RCMP vehicle with one of the objects. Officers deployed pepper spray at the man, and he went back into the store.

几分钟后，这名男子再次离开了商店，并在凌晨 4 点 44 分遇到了更多乘坐带有标记的警车的警员，这些警车抵达并停在加油站附近的十字路口。发生了冲突，其中两名警员开枪击中了该男子。The man left the store again a few minutes later, encountering additional officers in marked police vehicles who arrived and stopped at the intersection near the gas station at 4:44 a.m. A confrontation occurred and two of the officers discharged their firearms, striking the man.

这名男子接受了官员的治疗，然后接受了紧急医疗服务。他被送往医院，在那里他死了。The man was treated by the officers and then emergency medical services. He was transported to hospital, where he died.

调查人员在十字路口的警车附近找到了一把锤子。Investigators located a hammer near the police vehicles in the intersection.

ASIRT 的调查将检查武力的使用。不会发布更多信息。ASIRT’s investigation will examine the uses of force. No additional information will be released.

作为正在进行的调查的一部分，ASIRT 正在继续努力查明可能目睹了这名男子与警方对峙的各个方面的人。 ASIRT 要求任何可能去过该地区并且可能目睹了这些事件和/或可能有视频的人拨打 403-592-4306 联系调查人员。As part of its ongoing investigation, ASIRT is continuing efforts to identify people who may have witnessed aspects of the confrontation between the man and police. ASIRT is asking anyone who may have been in the area and may have witnessed these events and/or may have video to contact investigators at 403-592-4306.

ASIRT 的任务是有效、独立和客观地调查涉及艾伯塔省警察并导致任何人严重受伤或死亡的事件，以及对警察不当行为的严重或敏感指控。ASIRT’s mandate is to effectively, independently and objectively investigate incidents involving Alberta’s police that have resulted in serious injury or death to any person, as well as serious or sensitive allegations of police misconduct.
