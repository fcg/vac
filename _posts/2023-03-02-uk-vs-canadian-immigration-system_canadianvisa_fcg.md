!英国与加拿大移民制度	!The UK vs the Canadian Immigration System
	
加拿大和英国是世界上最具影响力和最发达国家的两个国家，这使它们成为热门的移民目的地。这两个国家都有包容性的移民政策，如果您符合标准，就可以轻松获得永久居留权。加拿大比英国提供更多的工作机会和更好的工资来支付成本，所以人们选择加拿大移民比英国更多。	Canada and the UK are two of the world's most influential and developed countries, making them popular destinations for immigrants. Both countries have inclusive immigration policies that make it easy to gain permanent residency if you fit the criteria. Canada offers more job opportunities and better wages to cover costs than the UK, so people opt for Canada's immigration more than the UK.
	
加拿大的生活成本比英国低近 8.7%，因此您可以在不超出预算的情况下过上优质的生活。加拿大拥有卓越的生活水平、独特的风景以及对移民友好、热情的态度。它的共同语言和与英国的密切联系使它成为一个完美的新目的地，但又不会显得完全陌生。加拿大的犯罪率比英国低23%，是世界上最安全的十大国家之一。	The cost of living in Canada is nearly 8.7% less than in the UK, so you can live a quality life without going out of your budget. Canada has an excellent standard of living, exceptional scenery, and a friendly, welcoming attitude to immigrants. Its shared language and close ties to the UK make it a perfect new destination without seeming entirely foreign. The crime rate in Canada is 23% lower than in the United Kingdom, making it one of the top ten safest nations in the world.

但是，在您做出决定之前，至关重要的是要检查每个国家/地区的移民系统，看看加拿大和英国哪个更适合您。	However, before you decide, it’s vital to examine each country’s immigration system and see which out of Canada vs UK is the right way for you.
	
## 加拿大的主要移民项目是什么？	What are Canada's Main Immigration Programs?
	
!加拿大的主要移民项目是什么	!What are Canada's Main Immigration Programs
	
加拿大有许多允许外国国民成为永久居民的计划。但是，加拿大最受欢迎的移民项目如下：	Canada has numerous programs allowing foreign nationals to become permanent residents. However, the most popular immigration programs for Canada are as follows:
	
### 快速通道	Express Entry
	
这是加拿大最受欢迎的移民项目，因为外国公民可以在线申请，处理时间可短至六个月。该系统主要针对那些被归类为技术工人的人。它为三种不同类型的技术工人提供了三个流：	This is Canada’s most popular immigration program, as foreign nationals can apply online, and processing times can be as low as six months. This system is primarily for those classed as skilled workers. It has three streams for the three different types of skilled workers:
	
- 联邦技术工人计划	-   The Federal Skilled Worker Program
	
- 对于那些从事需要学位的职业的人	-   For those who work in occupations that require a degree
	
- 联邦技术贸易计划	-   The Federal Skilled Trades Program
	
- 对于那些从事需要文凭等认证的行业的人。	-   For those who work in trades that require certification like a diploma.
	
- 加拿大体验班	-   The Canadian Experience Class
	
- 适用于在加拿大生活和工作至少一年的技术工人。	-   For skilled workers living and working in Canada for at least a year.

### 省提名计划	Provincial Nominee Program
	
加拿大 13 个省和地区中的 11 个通过省提名计划 (PNP) 提供特定的永久居留省提名。您可以直接向您选择的省份或通过快速通道系统申请，以增加获得永久居留权的机会。	Eleven of Canada’s 13 provinces and territories offer specific Provincial Nominations for permanent residency via a Provincial Nominee Program (PNP). You can apply directly to the province of your choice or via the Express Entry system to increase your chances of getting your permanent residency.

### 家庭赞助	Family Sponsorship
	
如果您有居住在加拿大的伴侣或近亲，他们可以担保您移居加拿大。您的担保人必须年满 18 岁，是加拿大公民或永久居民，并且拥有足够的资金来支持您抵达加拿大后的生活。	If you have a partner or close family member living in Canada, they can sponsor you to move to Canada. Your sponsor must be over 18, a Canadian citizen or permanent resident and possess enough money to support you once you arrive in Canada.

## 英国的主要移民项目是什么？	What are The Main Immigration Programs in the UK?
	
!英国的主要移民项目是什么	!What are The Main Immigration Programs in the UK
	
英国的系统与加拿大的系统略有不同。要获准永久居住在英国，您必须已经在英国生活和工作或在英国有家人。这称为无限期居留 (ILR)。	The UK’s system works slightly differently than Canada’s. To be allowed to live in the UK permanently, you must already be living and working in the UK or have family in the UK. This is called Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR).
	
除非您有家人居住在英国，否则您必须持有英国签证才能申请 ILR。英国最受欢迎的签证是技术工人签证，适用于具有以下条件的外国公民：	Unless you have family living in the UK, you must have a UK visa to apply for ILR. The most popular visa for the UK is the Skilled Worker Visa, which is for foreign nationals with:
	
- 在认可的英国雇主那里工作	-   A job with an approved UK employer
- 符合条件的职业列表中的工作机会	-   A job offer from the list of eligible occupations
- 雇主出具的赞助证明	-   A certificate of sponsorship from their employer
- 高于国家最低工资的工资协议。	-   An agreement of salary higher than the national minimum wage.
	
英国根据您的情况有多种签证计划，您可以在英国政府网站上找到。	The UK has multiple visa programs outside of this, based on your circumstances, which you can find on the UK government website.
	
## 移民到加拿大和英国需要多长时间？	How Long does it Take To Immigrate to Canada vs the UK?
	
!移民到加拿大和英国需要多长时间	!How long does it Take To Immigrate to Canada vs the UK
	
移民时间有很大差异，具体取决于您申请的项目以及您打算如何申请。然而，在英国获得永久居留权比在加拿大需要更长的时间。在加拿大，获得永久居留权可能只需要六个月，也可能需要五年以上，具体取决于您的资格和选择的移民计划。	Immigration times vary massively depending on which program you apply to and how you plan on applying. However, getting permanent residence in the UK takes longer than in Canada. In Canada, getting permanent residency can take as little as six months, or over five years, depending on your eligibility and chosen immigration program.
	
但是，如果您有资格参加特定国家/地区特定的计划，在加拿大获得工作或学习许可可能只需五周甚至 20 天。	However, getting a work or study permit in Canada can take as little as five weeks or even 20 days if you’re eligible for specific country-specific programs.
	
在此处了解有关加拿大移民时间的更多信息。	Learn more about Canadian Immigration times here.
	
移民英国所需的时间取决于签证类型和申请。如果申请很简单，将在处理时间内做出决定。根据英国政府的说法，90% 的非定居申请在申请日期后三周内决定，98% 在六周内决定，100% 在申请日期后的 12 周内决定。技术工人签证需要三个星期。您可以支付更快的决定。	The time it takes to immigrate to the UK depends on the type of visa and application. If the application is straightforward, it will be decided within processing times. According to the British government, 90% of non-settlement applications are decided within three weeks, 98% within six weeks, and 100% within 12 weeks of the application date. The Skilled Worker visa takes three weeks. You can pay for a faster decision.
	
如果您想在英国停留更长的时间，如果您仍然符合资格要求，您可以多次申请延长签证。五年后，您可以申请 ILR，您可以随心所欲地在英国生活、工作和学习。然而，许多申请人可能需要长达六年的时间才能通过英国移民系统成为英国公民。	If you want to stay longer in the UK, you can apply to extend your visa as many times as you like if you still meet eligibility requirements. After five years, you can apply for ILR, which gives you the right to live, work and study in the UK for as long as you like. However, it can take up to six years for many applicants to go through the UK immigration system to become British citizens.
	
## 哪个国家/地区的资格要求更高？	Which Country has Higher Eligibility Requirements?
	
!哪个国家有更高的资格要求	!Which Country has Higher Eligibility Requirements
	
这两个国家/地区都有广泛的资格要求，并且资格要求根据您的移民计划而有很大差异。然而，加拿大以较低的资格要求和对移民更为开放的政策而闻名，前提是他们与加拿大有联系或可以为加拿大经济做出重大贡献。	Both countries have a wide range of eligibility requirements, and eligibility requirements differ massively depending on your immigration program. However, Canada is known for lower eligibility requirements and a far more open policy towards immigrants, provided they have links to Canada or can substantially contribute to the Canadian economy.
	
虽然英国的最低要求可能相对较低，但如果没有来自英国的技术工作机会、在英国的家庭以及来自英国教育机构的录取通知书，英国政府几乎不可能获得延长的英国签证。	While the UK may have relatively low minimum requirements, the UK government makes getting a prolonged UK visa almost impossible without a skilled job offer from the UK, a family in the UK, and an acceptance letter from a UK educational institution.
	
但是，要了解您移民到这两个国家的机会有多大，最好咨询经过认证的移民专业人士，例如受监管的加拿大移民顾问 (RCIC)。 RCIC 了解加拿大移民系统并为您找到完美的途径。	However, to know what your chances are of immigrating to either of these countries, it’s best if you speak to a certified immigration professional like a Regulated Canadian Immigration Consultant (RCIC). An RCIC knows the Canadian immigration system backwards and finds the perfect pathway for you.

就像处理时间一样，费用也有很大差异，具体取决于您的签证或移民计划。这是加拿大移民费用的完整明细，以了解您必须为您的项目支付多少费用。	Much like processing times, costs vary massively, depending on your visa or immigration program. Here’s a full breakdown of Canada’s immigration fees to see how much you must pay for your program.
	
移民英国的费用取决于几个因素，包括签证类型、医疗附加费和其他费用。例如，截至 2023 年 2 月，技术工人签证申请费为 610 英镑。为帮助您确定费用，请使用英国政府的签证费用评估工具。	The cost of immigrating to the UK depends on several factors, including visa type, healthcare surcharge, and other expenses. For example, the Skilled Worker visa application fee is £610 as of February 2023. To help you determine your fees, here’s the UK government’s visa fee assessment tool.

!移民到加拿大与英国有多容易	!How Easy is it To Immigrate to Canada vs UK
	
英国和加拿大都有基于积分的移民系统，但它们之间存在显着差异。英国的新移民法优先考虑具有科学、学术和技术相关资格的高技能人才。相比之下，加拿大为特定技能、专业、学历、年龄、工作经验等授予积分。	The UK and Canada both have points-based immigration systems, but they have significant differences. The UK's new immigration law prioritizes highly skilled individuals with scientific, academic, and technology-related qualifications. In contrast, Canada grants points for particular skills, professions, educational qualifications, age, work experience, etc.
	
长期以来，加拿大一直以其友好的移民政策而闻名，因为它为移民开放了多个渠道。如果您符合条件，获得加拿大永久居留权很容易。英国的教育体系比加拿大更全面，拥有更多的大学和学院。但是，获得英国学生签证比获得加拿大学生签证容易得多。虽然获得英国学生签证可能很容易，但在英国获得永久居留权是一个漫长的过程。	Canada has long been known for its friendly immigration policies because of the multiple streams it has opened for immigrants. Gaining Canadian PR is easy if you fit the criteria. The education system in the UK is more comprehensive than Canada's, with more universities and colleges. However, getting a UK student visa is far easier than getting a Canadian one. Although getting a UK student visa might be easy, getting a PR in the UK is a long process.
	
另一方面，加拿大向完成两年硕士学位的学生提供两年工作许可，向完成八个月加拿大任何机构的扩展文凭或证书课程的学生提供一年工作许可。	On the other hand, Canada offers two years of work permits to students for completing two years long Master's degree and 1-year work permit to students who complete eight months extended diploma or certificate course from any Canadian institute.
	
## 带家人一起来有多容易？	How Easy is it to Bring My Family With Me?
	
!带家人一起来有多容易	!How Easy is it to Bring My Family With Me
	
每个国家/地区都有基于您与计划携带的家庭成员的关系的要求。但是，与您的家人一起移民加拿大通常更容易，因为加拿大更喜欢家庭移民，而不是单身申请人。	Each country has requirements based on your relationship with the family members you plan to bring. However, it’s generally easier to immigrate with your family to Canada as Canada prefers families to immigrate there over single applicants.
	
要与家人一起移居英国，您可以申请与家人团聚的签证。最常见的签证申请是加入伴侣，但您也可以申请其他家庭签证之一。带着孩子搬到英国很舒服，而且乘飞机也很方便。然而，带着孩子移居英国可能会有压力，因此了解英国的教育体系至关重要。	To move to the UK with your family, you can apply for a visa to join a family member. The most common visa applications are to join a partner, but you can also apply for one of the other family visas. Moving to England with kids is comfortable and well-connected by air. However, moving to the UK with children can be stressful, so it's essential to understand the UK education system.
	
如果您来自欧盟内部，并且在您的祖国同居过，您仍然可以持英国配偶签证移居英国。技术工人签证的家属必须证明他们的关系并且他们在本国共同生活过。	If you're from within the EU, you may still be able to move to the UK with a UK partner visa if you have lived together in your home country. Dependents of Skilled Worker Visa must prove their relationship and that they have lived together in their home country.
	
与您的家人一起搬到加拿大意味着您可以带家人，如果他们作为您的家属被处理为永久居留权。这包括您的配偶或同居伴侣、受抚养子女、配偶或同居伴侣的受抚养子女，以及受抚养子女的受抚养子女。您的家属不能在您之前到达加拿大。他们必须与您一起或在您之后到达。但是，在您通过家庭担保计划移民加拿大后，您也许可以担保他们。	Moving to Canada with your family means you can bring family members if they were processed for permanent residence as your dependents. This includes your spouse or common-law partner, dependent child, spouse or common-law partner’s dependent child, and a dependent child of a dependent child. Your dependents cannot arrive in Canada before you. They must arrive with you or after you. However, you may be able to sponsor them after you immigrate to Canada through the Family sponsorship program.

根据国家统计局的数据，2020 年 6 月至 2022 年 6 月期间，有 110 万人移居英国，平均每年有 550,000 人。	According to the Office for National Statistics, 1.1 million people migrated to the UK between June 2020 and June 2022, making it an average of 550,00 people annually.
	
根据加拿大移民、难民和公民部的数据，加拿大在 2022 年迎来了 431,645 名新永久居民。	According to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, Canada welcomed 431,645 new permanent residents in 2022.
	
虽然加拿大的数字可能看起来较低，但加拿大的统计委员会只考虑了永久居民，而英国统计了所有移民，无论他们是永久居民还是持临时签证（如工作许可）。	While the Canadian numbers may seem lower, Canada’s statistics board only ever considered permanent residents, while the UK counted all immigrants, whether they’re permanent or on a temporary visa like a work permit.
