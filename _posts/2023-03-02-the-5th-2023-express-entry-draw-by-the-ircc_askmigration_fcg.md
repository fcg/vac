2 月 1 日的 Express Entry 抽签仅针对获得省提名的候选人，而 2 月 2 日的抽签仅针对联邦技术工人计划 (FSWP)。	On the 1st of February, the Express Entry Draw was only for candidates who had a provincial nomination, while the draw on the 2nd of February was only for the Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP).
	
**什么是快速通道？**	**What is Express Entry?**
	
Express Entry 是指 IRCC 用于三个加拿大移民计划的申请管理系统：加拿大经验类移民计划 (CEC)、联邦技术贸易计划 (FSTP) 和联邦技术工人计划 (FSWP)。	Express Entry refers to an application management system the IRCC uses for three Canadian immigration programs: the Canadian Experience Class (CEC), the Federal Skilled Trades Program (FSTP) and the Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP).
	
如果您是省提名计划 (PNP) 的候选人并进入快速通道池，您将自动获得至少一个计划的资格。	If you are a candidate in the Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) and enter the Express Entry pool, you are automatically eligible for at least one of the programs.

Express Entry 是一个基于积分的系统。 IRCC 使用综合排名系统 (CRS) 对候选人的个人资料进行分类，并确定谁可以进入候选名单。	Express Entry is a point-based system. The IRCC uses the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) to classify candidates’ profiles and determine who gets to enter the pool.
	
只有得分最高的候选人才能获得申请邀请 (ITA)，并可以申请成为加拿大永久居民。	Only candidates with the highest scores get an Invitation to Apply (ITA) and can apply to become permanent residents in Canada.
	
候选人发送申请后，IRCC 的代表将审核申请并确定是否批准。如果获得批准，候选人可以申请永久居留权，这意味着他们距离成为加拿大公民仅一步之遥。	After the candidate sends their application, a representative from IRCC will review the application and determine if it is approved. If approved, the candidate can apply for permanent residency, which means they are one step away from becoming a Canadian citizen.
