如何将宠物带到加拿大 如果您有证据证明它已接种狂犬病疫苗，那么将您的宠物带到加拿大并不复杂。	How to bring pets to Canada Bringing your pet to Canada is not complicated if you have proof that it has received a rabies vaccine.
	
宠物是家庭的一员，很多新移民在决定移民加拿大时，都不会想着将宠物抛在身后。	Pets are members of the family, and many newcomers wouldn’t think of leaving them behind when they decide to immigrate to Canada.
	
加拿大对进口宠物的规定相当简单，几乎没有要求。但是，这可能会有所不同，具体取决于将动物带到加拿大的原因，以及您将宠物从哪个国家/地区带走。	Canada’s rules for importing pets are fairly straightforward and have few requirements. However, this can vary depending on why an animal is being brought to Canada, and what country you are bringing your pet from.
	
例如，将动物带到加拿大的规则可能会发生变化，具体取决于它是否已经是您的宠物，或者是否由救援组织带到加拿大供以后收养，是否被带入繁殖或表演，或者是否用于出售.任何非个人宠物的动物都被视为商业宠物，并受不同的入境要求约束。	For example, the rules for bringing an animal to Canada can change depending on whether it is already your pet or if it is being brought to Canada by a rescue organization for later adoption, being brought in for breeding or shows or if it is for sale. Any animal that is not a personal pet is considered a commercial pet and is subject to different entry requirements.
	
如果您有正确的文件在您到达时向加拿大边境服务代理人 (CBSA) 出示，那么将您的宠物带到加拿大并不困难。最好的起点是快速拜访您的兽医。	Bringing your pet to Canada is not difficult if you have the right documentation to show the Canadian Boarder Services Agent (CBSA) when you arrive. The best place to start is with a quick visit to your vet.
	
### 我的宠物需要什么样的文件？	What kind of documentation does my pet need?
	
**狂犬病疫苗证明**	**Proof of a rabies vaccine**
	
加拿大是一个无狂犬病的国家，并努力保持这种状态。进入加拿大的每只猫或狗都需要狂犬病疫苗接种证明，或者宠物来自“无狂犬病”名单上的国家之一。如果没有疫苗接种证明或宠物来自这些国家之一，您的宠物可能会被拒绝入境。	Canada is a rabies-free country and strives to stay that way. Every cat or dog that comes into Canada needs proof of rabies vaccination or that the pet is from one of the countries on the “rabies free” list. Without proof of vaccination or that the pet comes from one of these countries, your pet will likely be denied entry.
	
狂犬病疫苗接种证明必须：	The rabies vaccination certificate must:
	
* 以英文或法文书写；	  be written in English or French;
* 由有执照的兽医签发和签署；	  be issued and signed by a licensed veterinarian;
* 识别动物（年龄、品种、性别、颜色/标记、重量和微芯片/纹身编号（如果适用））；	  identify the animal (age, breed, sex, colour/markings, weight, and microchip/tattoo number if applicable);
* 声明该动物已接种狂犬病疫苗；	  state that the animal is vaccinated against rabies;
* 注明接种日期；	  indicate the date of vaccination;
* 注明许可疫苗的商品名称和序号；	  indicate the trade name and the serial number of the licensed vaccine;
* 注明免疫期限（否则，将被视为自接种之日起 1 年内有效）；和	  specify the duration of immunity (otherwise, it will be considered valid for 1 year from the date of vaccination); and
* 有签发证书的持照兽医的姓名和签名以及签名日期。	  have the name and signature of the licensed veterinarian that issued the certificate and the date it was signed.
	
狂犬病疫苗接种时，猫狗必须至少满 3 个月大。三个月以下未接种疫苗的小狗和小猫需要年龄证明。	Cats and dogs must be at least 3 months of age at the time of rabies vaccination. Puppies and kittens younger than three months, and are therefore not vaccinated, require proof of age.
	
### 我的宠物需要微芯片吗？	Does my pet need a microchip?
	
加拿大不要求对进口的个人宠物进行微芯片或纹身，但强烈建议这样做。微芯片是一种射频识别转发器，如果您的宠物丢失并被带到收容所，兽医会对其进行扫描。该芯片有一个识别号，可作为在国家、省或市数据库中查找所有者联系信息的参考。	Canada does not require imported personal pets to be microchipped or tattooed, but it is highly recommended. A microchip is a radio-frequency identification transponder that a veterinarian will scan for if your pet is lost and brought to a shelter. The chip has an identification number that acts as a reference to find the owner’s contact information in a national, provincial, or municipal database.
	
在商业类别下进口的 8 个月以下的狗必须有一个微芯片。这也适用于注定要被收养的狗。	Dogs under 8 months of age, who are imported under the commercial category, must have a microchip. This also applies to dogs who are destined for adoption.
	
### 爬行动物和啮齿动物呢？	What about reptiles and rodents?
	
由于沙门氏菌病毒的风险，加拿大食品检验局 (CFIA) 禁止进口任何两栖动物或爬行动物，包括海龟和乌龟。 CFIA 是加拿大的监管机构，负责确定哪些植物和牲畜（包括宠物）可以入境。	The Canada Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) prohibits importing any amphibians or reptiles, including turtles and tortoises due to the risk of salmonella viruses. The CFIA is the regulatory authority in Canada that determines what plants and livestock, including pets, are admissible.
	
老鼠、仓鼠和豚鼠等啮齿动物无需任何必要证明即可进入，因为腺鼠疫不再是严重威胁。这也适用于海狸、旅鼠和水豚等。	Rodents, such as rats, hamsters and guinea pigs are permitted without any certification necessary as bubonic plague is no longer a serious threat. This also applies to beavers, lemmings, and capybaras, among others.
	
### 费用	Fees
	
将您的宠物带到加拿大无需支付进口费用。但是，您可以期望 CBSA 代理人检查您的文件并确保您的宠物健康且受到良好照顾。您的第一只宠物的检查费用略高于 30 美元，任何其他宠物的检查费用为 5 美元。此费用不适用于从美国进入加拿大的动物。	There are no import fees for bringing your pet to Canada. However, you can expect a CBSA agent to inspect your documents and to ensure that your pet is healthy and well-cared for. The inspection costs just over $30 for your first pet and $5 for any additional pets. This fee does not apply to animals who are entering Canada from the United States.
	
如果边境人员认为您的宠物不健康并需要进一步检查，CFIA 的官员将被要求对您的宠物进行额外收费的评估。	If a border agent decides that your pet is not healthy and requires further inspection, an official from CFIA will be called upon to evaluate your pet for an additional fee.
	
### 运输	Transportation
	
无论动物的类型如何，一件事始终如一，那就是它们都需要人道地运输。虽然大多数关于人道运输的现有法规都与牛和猪等牲畜有关，但如果 CBSA 官员认为您没有安全舒适地运输宠物，他们可能会拒绝入境。此外，如果您的宠物乘飞机抵达，各个航空公司可能对如何运输您的宠物有不同的要求，您应该提前确认这些要求。	One thing that remains consistent, regardless of the type of animal, is that they all need to be transported humanely. While most existing regulations surrounding humane transportation are related to livestock such as cows and pigs, if a CBSA official deems that you are not transporting your pet safely and comfortably, they may deny entry. Additionally, if your pet is arriving by air, individual airlines may have different requirements for how to transport your pet and you should verify these requirements far in advance.
	
### 带走	Take away
	
决定您是否可以将您的宠物带到加拿大的主要因素是它是否来自一个已知疾病可以传播给其他宠物和牲畜的国家。例如，如果鸟主人来自禽流感（禽流感）风险较高的国家，则不允许他们携带宠物。	The main factor in deciding if you can bring your pet to Canada is if it comes from a country where there are known diseases that can spread to other pets and livestock. For example, bird owners are not allowed to bring their pets if they come from countries with a higher risk of avian influenza (bird flu).
	
此外，在 9 月，CFIA 禁止从被认为是狗狂犬病高风险国家的名单中进口商用狗。	Additionally, in September, CFIA put a banned the importation of commercial dogs from a list of countries that are considered high-risk for dog rabies.
