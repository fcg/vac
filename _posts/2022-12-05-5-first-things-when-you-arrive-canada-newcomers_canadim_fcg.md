您打算移民加拿大吗？新移民抵达加拿大后必须做几件事，为他们在加拿大的新生活做准备。虽然这个过程让人感到不知所措，但加拿大政府为新移民提供了许多服务，以帮助他们完成每一步。以下是您初到加拿大时应该做的五件事。	Are you planning on immigrating to Canada? There are several things that newcomers must do once they arrive to prepare for their new life in Canada. While the process can feel overwhelming, the Canadian government offers many services for newcomers to help every step of the way. Here are the top five things that you should do when you first arrive in Canada.
		
1\。住房	1\. Housing
	
当您抵达加拿大时，您需要立即找到住所。为自己省去一些压力，并在抵达前为自己预订一些临时住所。酒店或旅馆是短期住宿的绝佳选择，大多数都允许您在线预订房间。一旦您对自己的住所有了更多了解，您就可以开始寻找更永久的解决方案。	You’ll need a place to live right away when you land in Canada. Save yourself some stress and book yourself some temporary accommodations before you arrive. Hotels or hostels are a great option for short-term housing, and most allow you to reserve a room online. Once you know more about where you’re going to live, you can start looking into a more permanent solution.

2\.健康保险	2\. Health Insurance
	
加拿大公民和永久居民可以申请公共健康保险。每个省和地区都有自己的健康保险计划，所以一旦您知道您将在哪个省定居，请对省级计划涵盖的内容进行一些研究。	Canadian citizens and permanent residents can apply for public health insurance. Each province and territory has its own health insurance plan, so once you know which province you’ll settle in, do some research about what the provincial plan covers.
	
一些省份要求新居民最多等待三个月才能获得政府医疗保险。在等待期间，您可以购买私人保险来满足您的需求。您还可以为您所在省的公共计划未涵盖的任何服务购买私人保险。一些加拿大雇主还为其雇员提供扩展的健康保险。	Some provinces require new residents wait up to three months before they can receive government health insurance. You can buy private insurance to cover your needs while you wait. You can also buy private insurance for any services your province’s public plan doesn’t cover. Some Canadian employers also offer extended health insurance coverage for their employees.

3\.社会保险号码	3\. Social insurance number
	
社会保险号 (SIN) 是一个九位数的号码，您需要在加拿大工作。您还需要它才能获得政府计划和福利。您可以通过邮寄或亲自到加拿大服务办公室申请一份。您需要提供原始主要文件来证明您的身份和身份，例如永久居民卡或永久居留确认书。	A Social Insurance Number (SIN) is a nine-digit number that you need to work in Canada. You also need it to have access to government programs and benefits. You can apply for one by mail or in person at a Service Canada office. You’ll need to provide an original primary document to prove your identity and status, like a permanent resident card or confirmation of permanent residence.

4\。加拿大银行账户	4\. Canadian bank account
	
您应该尽快开设加拿大银行账户。在加拿大，即使您没有工作、没有永久地址、没有任何钱可以存入账户、信用评级很差或已经破产，您也可以开设个人银行账户。您只需亲自前往银行并出示有效的个人身份证明即可。银行出纳员将能够引导您完成整个过程，而且许多银行都有专门为加拿大新移民提供的服务。	You should open a Canadian bank account as soon as you can. In Canada, you can open a personal bank account even if you don’t have a job, don’t have a permanent address, don’t have any money to put in the account, have poor credit rating, or have been bankrupt. You just need to go to a bank in person and present valid personal identification. The teller at the bank will be able to walk you through the process, and many banks have services specifically for newcomers to Canada.

5\。与您的社区联系	5\. Connect with your community
	
搬到一个新地方可能会让人害怕，尤其是当您在新社区中不认识任何人时。结交新朋友不仅会让您有宾至如归的感觉，还会扩大您的专业网络并帮助您在加拿大找到工作。有移民服务组织将新移民与其他移民或加拿大人联系起来，这可能非常有帮助。您也可以在当地的社区中心、学校或慈善组织做志愿者。参与的方式有很多种，尝试寻找您可以参与的活动，以结识与您有相似兴趣的人。	Moving to a new place can be scary, especially if you don’t know anyone in your new community. Making new friends will not only help you feel at home, it will also grow your professional network and help you find a job in Canada. There are immigrant-serving organizations that connect newcomers with other immigrants or Canadians, which can be very helpful. You can also volunteer in your local community centres, schools, or charitable organizations. There are a lot of ways to get involved, try to find activities you can participate in to get to know people with similar interests to you.
