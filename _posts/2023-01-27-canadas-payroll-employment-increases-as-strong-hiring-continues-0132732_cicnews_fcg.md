2022 年 11 月，随着强劲的招聘持续，加拿大的就业人数增加，就业人数增加，表明招聘市场活跃。	Canada’s payroll employment increases, as strong hiring continues November 2022 saw increases in payroll employment that suggest a lively hiring market.
	
2022 年 11 月，在 15 个行业中的 10 个行业中，工资就业人数（从雇主那里领取工资或福利的员工人数）有所增加，这很好地表明了强劲的招聘环境，以及加拿大恢复到 COVID 之前的经济产出。	Across 10 out of 15 sectors, payroll employment (the number of employees receiving pay or receiving benefits from their employer) increased in November 2022—a good indication of a strong hiring climate, and a returning to pre-COVID economic output in Canada.
	
因此，许多行业的职位空缺也有所减少——因为面对迫在眉睫的劳动力短缺，雇主能够更有效地招聘来填补职位空缺。总体就业人数增加了 7,100 个，这是因为专业科技服务、公共管理、金融和保险部门的增加被零售贸易空间的大幅减少所抵消。	As a result, many industries also saw a decrease in job vacancies—as employers were more effectively able to hire to fill openings, in the face of looming labour shortages. Overall payroll employment increased by 7,100 jobs, as increases in the professional scientific and technical services, public administration, and finance and insurance sectors were offset by significant decreases in the retail trade space.
	
2022 年 11 月，职位空缺总数减少了 20,700 个，导致加拿大全国累计职位空缺 850,300 个。这意味着自 2022 年 5 月创下 100 万个职位空缺的历史新高以来，职位空缺减少了 151,900 个。这可以解释为商品和服务的经济生产正在继续恢复到大流行前水平的迹象。	Total job vacancies were down by 20,700 positions in November 2022, leading to a cumulative 850,300 vacancies across Canada. This represents a decrease of 151,900 job openings since the record high 1 million vacancies seen in May of 2022. This can be interpreted as a sign that economic production of goods and services is continuing to recover to pre-pandemic levels.
	
就业人数的增加（更具体地说）是一个很好的迹象，表明公司正在招聘并需要更多的工人——这是衡量经济增长的一个指标，因为更多的人可以通过增加就业来为经济做出贡献。从这个意义上说，对于新移民来说，了解哪些行业现在正在增加工资就业，了解哪些类型的企业正在经历加拿大的招聘激增可能是相关的。	An increase in payroll employment is (more specifically) a good indication that companies are hiring and have the necessity for more workers—a gauge of economic growth as more people overall can contribute to the economy through increased employment. In this sense it may be pertinent for newcomers to understand which sectors are increasing payroll employment now, to recognize which kind of businesses are experiencing surges in hiring in Canada.
	
11 月份就业人数增幅最大的行业包括：	The sectors which recorded the biggest gains in payroll employment in November included:
	
* 专业的科技服务（+5,600 个职位）；	  Professional scientific and technical services (+5,600 positions);
* 公共行政（+4,800 个职位）；	  Public administration (+4,800 positions);
* 金融和保险（+4,700 个职位）；和	  Finance and insurance (+4,700 positions); and
* 建筑业（+4,300 个职位）。	  Construction (+4,300 positions).
	
### 持续职位空缺	Persistent job vacancies
	
尽管 2022 年 11 月就业人数强劲增长，但加拿大在多个行业仍然面临大量职位空缺。	Despite strong growth in payroll employment in November 2022, Canada still faced a high number of job vacancies across multiple sectors.
	
医疗保健和社会援助（131,800 个职位空缺）——正如大量职位空缺所表明的那样，加拿大目前面临的一个长期问题是寻找更多的医疗保健工作者。尽管职位空缺减少了 19,300 个，但该领域的职位空缺总数仍然很高，比 2020 年 3 月增加了近 45%；加拿大政府采取的政策变化进一步反映了该领域对工人的需求：包括针对受过外国教育的医疗保健专业人员进行更简化的认证，并减少医生的移民障碍。	Healthcare and social assistance (131,800 vacancies)—a persistent problem for Canada currently is finding more healthcare workers, as the high number of vacancies indicates. Despite decreasing vacancies by 19,300 jobs in the total number of job vacancies in the space remain elevated, up nearly 45% from March 2020; This need for workers in the space is further reflected in policy changes the Canadian government has undertaken: including targeting more streamlined accreditation for foreign-educated healthcare professionals and reducing immigration barriers to physicians.
	
建筑业（79,000 个职位空缺）——值得注意的是，建筑业的职位空缺持续存在。尽管 11 月份就业人数强劲增长，但该行业的职位空缺仍然很高。这可能表明业务产出有所增加，但也表明该领域对员工的持续需求。事实上，2021 年 11 月建筑业的职位空缺几乎没有变化（73,900），表明这是加拿大持续需要工人的另一个行业，尤其是在经济复苏持续的情况下。同样，加拿大最近承诺帮助失去身份的建筑工人等政策变化，传达了此类劳动力对该国经济的重要性	Construction (79,000 vacancies)—It is interesting to note the persistent vacancies in the construction space. Despite making strong gains in payroll employment in November, job vacancies remain elevated in this sector. This may indicate both an increase in business output, but also a persistent need for workers in the space. In fact, vacancies in the construction sector in November of 2021 were virtually unchanged (73,900), indicating this is another sector where Canada has a persistent need for workers, especially as economic recovery continues. Again, policy changes like Canada’s recent commitment to helping out-of-status construction workers, communicates the importance of such labour to the country’s economy
	
专业、科学和技术服务（52,000 个职位空缺）——与建筑部门类似，专业、科学和技术部门在工资就业方面取得了良好进展——但职位空缺数量仍然增加。同样，这表明加拿大国内该领域的招聘和对工人的持续需求。事实上，自 2020 年 10 月以来，该行业的就业人数出现了积极增长。面对如此多的职位空缺，这是加拿大对这些工人的持续高需求的有力指标。	Professional, scientific, and technical services (52,000 vacancies)—similar to the construction sector, the Professional, scientific and technical sector experienced good gains in payroll employment—but still suffers from an increased number of job vacancies. Again, this shows both strong hiring, and continued demand for workers in the space within Canada. In fact, the sector has experienced positive employment gains since October of 2020. In the face of such a high number of job vacancies, this is a strong indicator of enduringly high demand for these workers within Canada.
	
移民对于解决这些劳动力短缺问题至关重要，因为加拿大的人口统计数据目前无法支持填补当前的职位空缺。在 2022 年 C-19 法案上台后，尊敬的肖恩弗雷泽（作为移民部长）现在能够在联邦快速通道池中创建组（可能基于候选人的职业、教育或语言能力等标准)——并向这些人发出申请邀请 (ITA)，以更直接地解决加拿大的经济和社会需求。具有持续职位空缺的职业很有可能成为这些抽签的目标。	Immigration will be crucial to address these labour shortages, as Canadian demographics currently cannot support filling current job vacancies. Following the ascension of Bill C-19 in 2022, the Honorable Sean Fraser (as Minister of Immigration) is now able to create groups in the federal Express Entry pool (possibly based on criteria such as the occupations, educations, or language ability of candidates)—and issue invitations to apply (ITAs) to these individuals to more directly address Canada’s economic and social needs. Professions with persistent job vacancies stand a strong chance of being targeted in these draws.
