作为快速通道申请人，我的资金证明需要多少钱？快速通道内三个项目中的两个项目的申请人必须出示资金证明作为项目资格的最低要求。在下面了解有关资金证明的更多信息。	How much money do I require for my proof of funds as an Express Entry applicant? Applicants to two of the three programs within Express Entry must show proof of funds as a minimum requirement for program eligibility. Find out more about proof of funds below.
	
资金证明是准加拿大移民向加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 证明他们拥有足够的资金在加拿大定居的方式。	Proof of funds is how a prospective Canadian immigrant shows Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) that they possess enough money to settle in Canada.
	
资金证明是加拿大移民申请流程的重要组成部分，因为它们消除了 IRCC 可能对申请人开始在加拿大开始生活的经济支持能力的任何怀疑。此外，资金证明具体确定了申请人照顾家庭成员的能力。	Proof of funds is a vital part of the Canadian immigration application process because they remove any doubt that IRCC may have surrounding an applicant’s ability to financially support themselves as they begin building a life in this country. Moreover, proof of funds concretely establishes an applicant’s capacity to take care of their family members.
	
以下将重点介绍快速通道背景下的资金证明，因为快速通道是 IRCC 欢迎经济类移民来到加拿大的主要途径。	The following will focus on proof of funds in the context of Express Entry because Express Entry is the main pathway through which IRCC welcomes economic class immigrants to Canada.
	
### 有关资金证明的重要细节	Important details about proof of funds
	
用作资金证明的资金必须可供申请人随时使用。换句话说，财产权益不符合这些目的。此外，这笔钱不能从其他人那里借来，而且必须在支付生活费用时可用。最后，任何用于资金证明的资金都必须“在\[个人申请加拿大永久居留权\]和\[申请人获得\]永久居留签证时”可用。	Money used as proof of funds must be readily available to the applicant. In other words, equity on a property does not qualify for these purposes. Additionally, this money cannot be borrowed from another person and it must be available when it is time to pay the costs of living. Finally, any money used for proof of funds must be available “both when \[an individual applies for Canadian permanent residence\] and when \[the applicant is issued\] a permanent residence visa.”
	
抵达加拿大后，申请人必须准备好并能够向 IRCC 官员证明他们可以合法地使用这笔钱在这里使用。	Upon arrival in Canada, the applicant must be prepared and able to prove to an IRCC officer that they can legally access the money to use here.
	
使用移民申请人持有资金的“来自任何银行或金融机构的正式信函”，申请人必须能够证明他们持有足够的资金来支持自己和所有家庭成员抵达时的生活到加拿大。	Using an official letter “from any bank(s) or financial institution(s) where” an immigration applicant is holding their money, the applicant must be able to display that they hold enough money to support themselves and all members of their family upon arrival to Canada.
	
任何资金证明信必须：	Any proof of funds letter must:
	
* 打印在金融机构的抬头纸上	  be printed on the financial institution’s letterhead
* 包括他们的姓名和联系信息（地址、电话号码和电子邮件地址）	  include their name and contact information (address, telephone number and email address)
* 列出任何未偿债务（信用卡债务和贷款）	  list any outstanding debts (credit card debts and loans)
* 包括，对于每个活期银行和投资账户，：账户号码、开户日期和每个账户的当前余额以及过去 6 个月的平均余额	  include, for each current bank and investment account, the: account numbers, open date and current balance of each account and average balance for the past 6 months
	
### 了解谁有资格成为家庭成员	Understanding who qualifies as a member of the family
	
出于这些目的，家庭成员包括主申请人、他们的受抚养子女、他们的配偶或同居伴侣以及申请人配偶/伴侣的任何受抚养子女。	For these purposes, members of a family include the principal applicant, their dependent children, their spouse or common-law partner and any dependent children of the applicant’s spouse/partner.
	
**注意：** 申请人的配偶/伴侣和配偶/伴侣的受抚养子女应包括在资金证明的家庭成员中，即使他们本身是永久居民（PR）/加拿大公民或他们不来加拿大与申请人一起	**Note:** The applicant’s spouse/partner and the spouse/partner’s dependent children should be included as members of the family for proof of funds even if they are themselves permanent residents (PRs)/Canadian citizens or they are not coming to Canada alongside the applicant
	
如果申请人的配偶/伴侣将陪同他们前往加拿大，则联名账户中的资金可计入资金证明。仅在配偶/伴侣名下的账户中持有的资金也可以计算在内，前提是主申请人可以证明他们可以使用这笔钱。	In the case that an applicant’s spouse/partner will be accompanying them to Canada, funds held in a joint account may be counted towards proof of funds. Funds held in an account under only the spouse/partner’s name can be counted as well, assuming the principal applicant can prove they have access to the money.
	
### 谁需要出示资金证明，谁不需要？	Who needs to show proof of funds and who does not?
	
联邦技术工人计划 (FSWP) 和联邦技术贸易计划 (FSTP) 的申请人必须出示资金证明，以满足这些计划的最低资格要求。	Applicants to the Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP) and Federal Skilled Trades Program (FSTP) are required to present proof of funds to meet the minimum eligibility requirements for these programs.
	
同时，加拿大经验类（CEC）申请人以及获准在加拿大工作并持有有效工作机会的移民申请人无需提供资金证明。即使对于满足这些条件的 FSWP 和 FSTP 申请人也是如此。	Meanwhile, Canadian Experience Class (CEC) applicants as well as immigration applicants who are authorized to work in Canada and hold a valid job offer are not required to provide proof of funds. This remains true even for FSWP and FSTP applicants who meet these conditions.
	
### 根据家庭规模细分资金证明要求	Breakdown of proof of funds requirements based on family size
	
每个申请人需要证明他们拥有的金额根据他们拥有的家庭成员的数量而有所不同。同样，就“资金证明”而言，一个人的家庭人数必须包括主申请人的配偶和同居伴侣（以及他们的受抚养子女），即使他们已经是加拿大公民/永久居民，或者他们是不与申请人一起来加拿大。	The amount of money that each individual applicant will need to prove they possess varies in accordance with the number of family members they have. Again, the size of one’s family for the purposes of a “proof of funds” must include the spouses and common-law partners (as well as their dependent children) of the principal applicant even if they are already Canadian citizens/PRs or they are not coming to Canada alongside the applicant.
