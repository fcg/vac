# Express Entry：加拿大举行有史以来最大规模的全项目抽签 IRCC 邀请了 7,000 名最低 CRS 分数为 490 的候选人。这是自 1 月 18 日以来的首次全项目抽签。	Express Entry: Canada holds largest all-program draw ever IRCC invites 7,000 candidates with a minimum CRS score of 490. This is the first all-program draw since January 18.
IRCC 今天举行了 2023 年第七次快速通道抽签。	IRCC held the seventh Express Entry draw of 2023 today.
	
加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 向 7,000 名最低综合排名系统 (CRS) 分数为 490 分的候选人发出了邀请。	Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) issued invitations to 7,000 candidates with a minimum Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) score of 490.
	
本次抽签中的 ITA 数量打破了 1 月 18 日上次全项目抽签邀请的 5,500 名候选人的记录。在全项目抽签中，考虑了所有三个快速入境项目的候选人：联邦技术工人计划 (FSWP) 、联邦技术贸易计划 (FSTP) 和加拿大经验类 (CEC)。	The number of ITAs in this draw beats the previous record of 5,500 candidates invited in the last all-program draw on January 18. In an all-program draw candidates are considered from all three Express Entry programs: the Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP), the Federal Skilled Trades Program (FSTP) and the Canadian Experience Class (CEC). 
	
此次抽签打破了过去两个月出现的特定项目抽签的模式。自上次全项目抽签以来，已经进行了四轮针对特定项目的邀请，三轮仅针对 PNP，另一轮针对 FSWP 候选人。最近的抽签仅限 PNP，3 月 1 日只有 697 名候选人收到了 ITA。	This draw breaks a pattern of program specific draws that have been occurring over the past two months. Since the last all-program draw there have been four program-specific rounds of invitations, three for PNP-only and one for FSWP candidates. The most recent draw was PNP-only and just 697 candidates received ITAs on March 1.
	
在 2023 年之前，2022 年 7 月至 2022 年 11 月之间的所有快速通道抽签都是全项目抽签，每次邀请超过 1,000 名候选人，并且随着最低 CRS 分数的降低而增加。	Prior to 2023, all Express Entry draws between July and November 2022 were all-program draws that invited over 1,000 candidates each time and grew as the minimum CRS score decreased.
	
### IRCC 发布 2021 快速通道数据	IRCC releases 2021 Express Entry data
	
IRCC 最近发布的一份报告总结了 2021 年的快速通道数据，这是该项目历史上独一无二的一年。	A recently released report from IRCC summarizes Express Entry data for 2021, which was a unique year in the program’s history.
	
从 2020 年 12 月开始，所有计划的抽签都暂停了，以缓解因 COVID-19 相关旅行限制和边境关闭造成的积压。 IRCC 继续向加拿大经验类 (CEC) 和省提名计划 (PNP) 的候选人发出 ITA，直到 2021 年 9 月 CEC 抽签也暂停。	Starting in December 2020, all-program draws were paused to ease the backlog caused by COVID-19 related travel restrictions and border closures. IRCC continued to issue ITAs to candidates in the Canadian Experience Class (CEC) and the Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) until September 2021 when CEC draws were also paused.
	
总体而言，2021 年签发了 114,431 个 ITA。2021 年没有全项目快速通道抽签。所有 42 个快速通道抽签都是针对 PNP 和 CEC 的特定项目，没有 ITA 签发给 FSWP 或联邦技术贸易计划 (FSTP) ） 候选人。	Overall, there were 114,431 ITAs issued in 2021. There were no all-program Express Entry draws in 2021. All 42 Express Entry draws were program specific for the PNP and the CEC and no ITAs were issued to FSWP or Federal Skilled Trades Program (FSTP) candidates.
	
超过一半 (64%) 的 ITA 签发给了 20-29 岁之间的接受者。在综合排名系统下，这个年龄段的候选人将获得 100 CRS 积分。候选人在 30 岁后获得的分数会减少。	Over half, 64%, of ITAs were issued to recipients between the ages of 20-29 years. Under the Comprehensive Ranking System, candidates in this age range receive 100 CRS points. Candidates receive fewer points after they turn 30.
	
由于暂停，大多数 ITA 都发给了已经作为临时居民居住在加拿大的候选人。但是，仍有一些 ITA 签发给居住在国外的候选人。排名前五的民族是	Because of the pauses, the majority of ITAs were issued to candidates who were already living in Canada as temporary residents. However, there were still some ITAs issued to candidates living abroad. The top five nationalities were

### 什么是快速通道？	What is Express Entry?
	
快速通道申请管理系统监管三个项目：加拿大经验类项目 (CEC)、联邦技术工人项目 (FSWP) 和联邦技工项目 (FSTP)。省提名计划 (PNP) 的候选人已经有资格参加至少一项快速入境计划。	The Express Entry application management system oversees three programs: the Canadian Experience Class (CEC), the Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP) and the Federal Skilled Trades Program (FSTP). Candidates in the Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) are already eligible for at least one Express Entry program.
	
Express Entry 项目使用基于积分的综合排名系统 (CRS) 对候选人进行排名。分数是根据工作经验、语言能力、教育和人力资本因素授予的。得分最高的候选人将收到申请邀请 (ITA)，然后可以申请永久居留权。	Express Entry programs rank candidates using the points-based Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS). Points are awarded based on work experience, language ability, education, and human capital factors. Candidates with the highest scores will receive an Invitation to Apply (ITA) and can then apply for permanent residency.
	
候选人有 60 天的时间来完成并提交申请。然后 IRCC 官员审查申请并决定候选人是否被批准。	A candidate has 60 days to complete and submit their application. An IRCC officer then reviews the application and decides if the candidate is approved.
