确保在快速通道下提交完整电子申请的重要性重要的是，准加拿大移民在收到通过快速通道申请加拿大永久居留的邀请后，确切地知道该怎么做。	The importance of making sure to submit a complete electronic application under Express Entry It is important that prospective Canadian immigrants know exactly what to do after they receive an Invitation to Apply through Express Entry for permanent residence in Canada.
	
长期以来，快速通道一直是希望来加拿大的外国人的首选移民途径。	Express Entry has long been a top immigration pathway for foreign nationals looking to come to Canada.
	
这种移民途径的流行使得收到申请邀请 (ITA) 的人在完成加拿大永久居留 (PR) 在线申请时确切地知道该做什么至关重要。	The popularity of this immigration pathway makes it crucial that people who receive an Invitation to Apply (ITA) know exactly what to do when completing their online application for Canadian permanent residence (PR).
	
事实上，加拿大的目标是在 2023 年至 2025 年期间通过快速入境申请管理系统欢迎 305,900 名移民，该系统管理通过三个项目提出的移民申请：加拿大经验类 (CEC)、联邦技术工人计划 (FSWP) 和联邦技术行业计划 (FSTP)。	In fact, Canada is aiming to welcome 305,900 immigrants between 2023 and 2025 through the Express Entry application management system, which manages immigration applications made through three programs: the Canadian Experience Class (CEC), the Federal Skilled Workers Program (FSWP) and the Federal Skilled Trades Program (FSTP).
	
注：根据加拿大最新的移民水平计划（2023-2025），未来三年 305,900 名移民的总目标仅落后于加拿大省提名计划 (PNP) 的目标	Note: The total target of 305,900 immigrants over the next three years trails only Canada’s Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) target according to Canada’s latest Immigration Levels Plan (2023-2025)
	
既然已经对 Express Entry 有了基本的了解，那么重要的是准加拿大移民了解不完整的 Express Entry PR 申请的后果，并了解他们可以做些什么来确保他们不会犯这个错误。	Now that a basic understanding of Express Entry has been established, it is important that prospective Canadian immigrants understand the consequences of an incomplete Express Entry PR application and learn what they can do to ensure they do not make this mistake.
	
### 快速通道申请不完整的后果	Consequences of an incomplete Express Entry application
	
如果加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 收到不完整的加拿大永久居民申请，他们会将文件退还给申请人。	If Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) receives an incomplete application for PR in Canada, they will return the file to the applicant.
	
收到退回的申请后，申请人将需要完全重新开始他们的快速通道之旅。这是因为 IRCC 的政策规定，加拿大移民管理机构在任何情况下都不会接受因不完整而被退回的相同申请。因此，因申请不完整而收到退回申请的申请人必须向 IRCC 提交新的个人资料，以重新进入快速通道池，并希望他们再次被邀请申请加拿大永久居民。	Upon receipt of a returned application, the applicant will need to completely restart their Express Entry journey. This is because IRCC’s policy dictates that Canadian immigration’s governing body will, under no circumstances, accept the same application back after it was returned due to incompletion. Therefore, applicants who receive a returned application because it was incomplete must submit a new profile with IRCC to re-enter the Express Entry pool and hope that they get invited to apply for Canadian PR again.
	
换句话说，在收到 ITA 后失去第一次申请加拿大永久居民的机会（由于提交的申请不完整）可能对移民在加拿大的未来不利。这是因为 Express Entry 抽签固有的不可预测性——目前根据经常波动的综合排名系统 (CRS) 分数对候选人进行优先排序——使得潜在移民在需要提交 ITA 时很难获得“第二次机会”在他们的第一份申请被不完整地退回后，他们拥有全新的快速通道资料。	In other words, losing out on a first opportunity to apply for Canadian PR (due to the submission of an incomplete application) after receiving an ITA could be detrimental to an immigrant’s future in this country. This is because the inherent unpredictability of Express Entry draws — which currently prioritize candidates based on often-fluctuating Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) scores — makes it hard for prospective immigrants to get a “second chance” at an ITA should they need to submit a completely new Express Entry profile after their first application was returned incomplete.
	
### 给快速通道申请人的提示和建议	Tips and recommendations for Express Entry applicants
	
为避免通过快速通道系统提交不完整申请的后果，以下内容将为加拿大的准移民提供一些在收到 ITA 后申请永久居留权时需要记住的关键事项。	To avoid the consequences of submitting an incomplete application through the Express Entry system, the following will provide prospective immigrants to Canada with a few key things to remember as they apply for PR after receiving an ITA.
	
首先，如果 Express Entry 候选人知道他们将缺少 IRCC 要求作为 PR 申请一部分的文件，他们必须在提交时包含一份单独的文件，概述未包含该文件的原因。	To begin, if an Express Entry candidate knows that they will be missing a document that IRCC requires as part of a PR application, they must include a separate document with their submission that outlines the reasons why the document is not included.
	
**注意：**是否接受这种文件遗漏的推理将由 IRCC 和处理给定文件的移民官员/当局全权酌情决定	**Note:** Acceptance of this reasoning for document omission will be at the full discretion of IRCC and the immigration officer/authorities handling a given file
	
加拿大公关申请人还必须记住，他们需要按照加拿大政府要求的格式翻译任何提交材料，包括非英语或法语的印章和印章。有关文档翻译的详细信息，请参见此处。	Canadian PR applicants must also remember that they are required to translate any submission materials, including stamps and seals that aren’t in English or French, in the format that is required by the Government of Canada. Details about document translation are available here.
	
此外，关于快速入境 ITA 接收者在申请加拿大永久居民时必须提交的许多文件，还有一些重要事项需要记住。	Additionally, there are important things to remember with respect to many of the documents that an Express Entry ITA recipient must submit as part of their application for Canadian PR.
	
### 警方证明	Police Certificates
	
例如，提交无犯罪记录涉及 IRCC 概述的非常具体的要求，因为不同无犯罪证明的格式因签发国家/地区而异。因此，所有申请人都必须仔细阅读 IRCC 的提交要求，因为未能根据加拿大指南提供警方证明将导致申请被退回。	For example, police certificate submissions involve very specific requirements outlined by IRCC because the format of different police certificates varies by issuing country. Therefore, all applicants must review IRCC’s submission requirements with care because failure to provide a police certificate according to Canadian guidelines will result in a returned application.
	
该文件必须由主申请人、他们的配偶或同居伴侣以及任何 18 岁或以上的受抚养子女（包括非陪同子女）提交。	This documentation must be submitted by the principal applicant, their spouse or common-law partner and any dependent children who are 18 or older (including non-accompanying).
	
### 体检确认	Medical Examination Confirmations
	
作为 PR 申请的一部分提交的体检确认书必须在提交时有效，并且移民体检 (IME) 编号必须包含在永久居留申请中。 PR 申请必须包括“信息打印件或前期医疗报告表 \[IMM 1017B\]”。	Medical examination confirmations submitted as part of a PR application must be valid at the time of submission, and the immigration medical examination (IME) number must be included in the application for permanent residence. The application for PR must include either “the information printout or the Upfront Medical Report form \[IMM 1017B\]”.
	
该文件必须由主申请人、他们的配偶或同居伴侣及其受抚养子女（包括非随行子女）提交。	This documentation must be submitted by the principal applicant, their spouse or common-law partner and their dependent children (including non-accompanying).
	
### 工作经验证明	Proof of Work Experience
	
对于申请人声明的每项工作经验，他们必须提交雇主的推荐信或经验信或“公司章程或其他企业所有权证据、个体经营证明和第三方个人的文件，表明所提供的服务以及付款详情”（如果是自雇人士）。	For each work experience declared by the applicant, they must submit a reference or experience letter from the employer or “articles of incorporation or other evidence of business ownership, evidence of self-employment and documentation from third-party individuals indicating the service provided along with payment details” (if self-employed).
	
该文件必须由主申请人及其配偶或同居伴侣（如果声称在加拿大有工作经验）提交。	This documentation must be submitted by the principal applicant and their spouse or common-law partner (if claiming work experience in Canada).
	
**注意：**加拿大政府网站上提供了加拿大永久居民申请所需文件的完整列表，以及每份文件的具体要求	**Note:** A complete list of required documents for a Canadian PR application, as well as specific requirements for each document, is available on the Government of Canada’s website
