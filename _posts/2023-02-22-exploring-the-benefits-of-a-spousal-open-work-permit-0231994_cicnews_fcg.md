探索配偶开放式工作许可的好处 配偶开放式工作许可允许您的伴侣在加拿大工作，同时等待 IRCC 的决定。	Exploring the benefits of a spousal open work permit A Spousal Open Work Permit allows your partner to work in Canada while waiting for a decision from IRCC.
	
加拿大希望通过配偶和子女赞助计划每年欢迎 82,000 名新永久居民来到加拿大。但是，加拿大移民难民和公民部 (IRCC) 可能需要一年多的时间来处理该计划下的申请。与此同时，您的配偶或伴侣可能可以获得配偶开放式工作许可证 (SOWP)。	Canada hopes to welcome 82,000 new permanent residents to Canada per year under Spousal Partner and children sponsorship programs. However, it can take over a year for Immigration Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) to process an application under this program. In the meantime, your spouse or partner may be able to obtain a Spousal Open Work Permit (SOWP).
	
如果您的伴侣通过内陆配偶担保申请永久居留权，他们可能有资格获得配偶开放式工作许可。	If your partner is applying for permanent residence through inland spousal sponsorship, they may be eligible for a spousal open work permit.
	
### 什么是开放式工作许可证？	What is an open work permit?
	
与封闭式工作许可证将一个人限制为一个雇主不同，开放式工作许可证赋予外国公民合法居住在加拿大任何地方并为任何雇主工作的权利。	Unlike a closed work permit, that limits a person to one employer, an open work permit gives foreign nationals the right to legally live anywhere in Canada and work for any employer.
	
持开放式工作许可在加拿大工作可以免除其他临时工作许可所涉及的一些要求，例如劳动力市场影响评估 (LMIA)。此外，申请工作不一定要有工作邀请。	Working in Canada on an open work permit frees you from some of the requirements involved in other temporary work permits, such as a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA). Further, it is not necessary to have a job offer to apply.
	
### 配偶开放式工签的好处	Benefits of a spousal open work permit
	
在短期内，拥有开放式工作许可可能意味着您的伴侣能够进入加拿大的劳动力市场，从而在 IRCC 处理他们的永久居留申请时减轻您家庭的经济压力。	In the short term, having an open work permit can mean that your partner is able to enter Canada’s workforce and therefore reduce the financial strain on your household while IRCC processes their permanent residency application.
	
此外，开放式工作许可证允许夫妻在等待 IRCC 的决定时住在一起。如果没有某种临时工作许可，外国国民在整个过程中被允许留在加拿大的可能性要小得多。	Additionally, an open work permit allows couples to live together while they wait for a decision from IRCC. Without a temporary work permit of some kind, it is far less likely a foreign national will be allowed to stay in Canada for the entire length of the process.
	
在等待永久居留权的同时在加拿大工作可以让个人提高语言技能，获得加拿大工作经验并建立专业和社交网络。这些都是在申请永久居留权时可以发挥优势的因素。	Working in Canada while waiting for permanent residency allows an individual to improve their language skills, gain Canadian work experience and create professional and social networks. These are all factors that can work to someone’s advantage when applying for permanent residence.
	
SOWP 的有效期取决于主申请人的工作许可证何时到期。例如，如果您持有毕业后工作许可 (PGWP) 在加拿大，当您的 PGWP 到期时，您伴侣的 SOWP 将不再有效。同样的逻辑适用于所有其他类型的临时居留权。	The length of validity for an SOWP depends on when the lead applicant’s work permit expires. For example, if you are in Canada on a Post-Graduate Work Permit (PGWP), your partner’s SOWP will no longer be valid when your PGWP expires. The same logic applies to all other types of temporary residency.
	
如果主要申请人是加拿大公民，您的 SOWP 将在他们的护照到期时到期。	If the lead applicant is a Canadian citizen, your SOWP will expire when their passport does.
	
### **SOWP 的资格**	**Eligibility for a SOWP**
	
为了获得配偶开放式工作许可，必须满足某些标准。	In order to get a spousal open work permit, there are certain criteria which must be met.
	
* 提交永久居留的配偶/同居伴侣担保申请。	  A spousal/common-law partner sponsorship application for permanent residence is submitted.
* 申请人必须具有访客、学生或工人等有效的临时居民身份。	  The applicant must have valid temporary resident status as a visitor, student or worker.
* 申请人和担保人必须满足配偶/同居伴侣担保的所有资格标准。	  The applicant and sponsor must meet all eligibility criteria for the spousal/common-law partner sponsorship.
	
值得注意的是，被担保人必须已经在加拿大并与其伴侣同住。已申请配偶担保但居住在加拿大境外的申请人不符合资格。	Notably, the person being sponsored must already be in Canada and living with their partner. Applicants who have applied for spousal sponsorship but are living outside of Canada are not eligible.
	
### 如何申请	How to apply
	
外国配偶或伴侣可以同时或之后的任何时间申请 SOWP，他们可以通过配偶担保计划申请永久居留权。	Foreign spouses or partners can apply for a SOWP at the same time, or any time after, they apply for permanent residence through the spousal sponsorship program.
	
一旦您的伴侣收到 IRCC 的通知，表明他们有资格获得永久居留权，或者“原则上批准”，他们就可以在线申请 SOWP。原则上获得批准意味着他们符合资格标准，但尚未通过医疗、安全或背景调查。	Once your partner has received notification from IRCC that they are eligible for permanent residence, or “approved in principle” they can apply for SOWP online. To be approved in principle means they meet eligibility criteria but have not passed medical, security or background checks.
