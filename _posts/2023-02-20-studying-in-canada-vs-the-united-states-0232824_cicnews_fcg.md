在美国或加拿大学习的决定是这些学生中的许多人将面临的决定。虽然这两个国家在教育质量和毕业后就业机会方面具有可比性，但在学费、经济援助和毕业后移民机会方面存在重大差异，这使得加拿大成为国际学生的首选目的地。	The decision to study in either the U.S. or Canada is one that many of these students will face. While the two nations are comparable with respect to quality of education, and post-Graduation employment opportunities —there are key differences in tuition, financial aid, and immigration opportunities post-graduation, that have made Canada a preferred destination among international students.
	
### 教育质量	Quality of Education
	
虽然教育质量通常因个别学术机构（和学习项目）而异，但加拿大和美国的高等教育可以进行显着比较。	Though quality of education is often specific to individual academic institutions (and programs of study), there are notable comparisons that can be made higher education in Canada and the U.S.
	
2023年，QS（国际公认的高等教育分析机构）对国际最佳学生城市进行了排名。加拿大占据前 20 名中的三个（蒙特利尔、多伦多和温哥华），而美国占据两个（波士顿和纽约市）。这是两国教育质量均衡的普遍迹象——至少在构成高等教育中心的城市是这样。	In the 2023, QS (an internationally recognized higher education analytics agency) ranked the best student cities internationally. Canada held three of the top 20 spots (Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver), while the United States held two (Boston and New York City). This is a general indication of evenness in the quality of education between both countries—at least in the cities that make up their post-secondary educational hubs.
	
虽然这很有用，但当我们按国家/地区查看数据时会发生什么？	While this is helpful, what happens when we look at data on a country-by-country basis?
	
IDP（国际发展项目）——一家专门从事加拿大、澳大利亚和美国学生安置的国际教育组织——最近进行的一项调查发现，加拿大绝对是国际学生的首选学习目的地：27% 的受访者认为加拿大成为他们的首选。相比之下，只有 15% 的受访者选择了美国，排名第四，分别落后于澳大利亚和英国 (U.K.)。	A recent survey conducted by the IDP (International Development Project)—an international education organization specializing in student placement in Canada, Australia, and the US—found that Canada was overwhelmingly the top choice destination of study among international students: 27% of respondents consider Canada as their first choice. By comparison only 15% of respondents picked the U.S., which ranked fourth—trailing behind Australia and the United Kingdom (U.K.) respectively.
	
如果教育质量大体相似，是否还有其他原因导致国际学生强烈选择加拿大而不是美国？	If quality of education is largely similar, are there other reasons that international students strongly preferred Canada to the U.S.?
	
### 价格	Price
	
学费是选择出国留学地点的一个重要因素。在美国，平均教育费用在 20,000 美元到 60,000 美元之间，具体取决于一个人是就读于公立还是私立机构，以及所追求的学习水平。	Tuition costs are a huge factor in choosing where to study abroad. In the U.S., the average cost of education is between $20,000 to $60,000 USD, depending on whether one attends a public or private institution, and what level of study one is pursuing.
	
相反，加拿大高等教育的平均费用在 20,000 加元到 40,000 加元之间——同样取决于机构和学习水平。但是请注意，货币差异。加拿大与国际货币的汇率更有利（此外平均学费较低）使其成为国际学生的一个有吸引力的目的地——尤其是与美国相比。	Conversely, the average cost of post-secondary education in Canada is between $20,000 to $40,000 CAD—again dependent on institution and level of study. Note however, the difference in currency. Canada’s more favourable exchange rate with international currency (in addition to lower average tuition costs) makes it an attractive destination for international students—especially when compared to the U.S.
	
### 经济资助	Financial Aid
	
国际学生也可以考虑奖学金和助学金的可用性。虽然美国确实有针对国际学生的国家资助和机构特定的奖学金，但没有联邦政府资助的项目为国际学生提供经济援助。在美国的国际学生也有资格获得学生贷款，但他们需要一个信誉良好的共同签署人，该担保人是美国公民或永久居民。	International students may also consider the availability of scholarships and bursaries. While the United States does have state funded, and institution-specific scholarships for international students—there are no federally funded programs to deliver financial aid to international students. International students in the U.S. are also eligible for student loans, though they will need a credit-worthy co-signer who is a U.S. citizen or permanent resident.
	
与此同时，加拿大在大学、省和联邦层面为国际学生提供奖学金，通常比美国的同类项目更容易获得。此外，国际学生还可以获得与加拿大相同的条款和还款时间表的贷款公民和永久居民。	Meanwhile, Canada has scholarships for international students on the university, provincial and federal level, that are often much easier to avail than comparable programs in the U.S. Additionally, international students are also able to take out loans with the same terms and repayment schedules as Canadian citizens and permanent residents.
	
### 国际学生的工作机会	Work possibilities for international students
	
加拿大和美国国际学生的工作成果基本相同，但两者之间存在一些显着差异。	Work outcomes were largely the same for international students in both Canada and the U.S., with some noted difference between the two.
	
例如，World Education News + Review (WENR) 的一项调查发现，在 1,095 名国际校友受访者中，有 62% 的人在毕业后找到了全职工作。国家经济研究局还发现，大约 23% 的硕士毕业生在学习期间找到了工作。	For example, a survey by World Education News + Review (WENR) found that 62% of 1,095 international alumni respondents had found full-time employment after graduation. The National Bureau of Economic Research also found that roughly 23% of Master’s graduates found work in their state of study.
	
相比之下，加拿大统计局在 2022 年进行的一项研究发现，各级学习的国际毕业生平均有 73% 的全职就业率。	Comparatively, a 2022 study conducted by Statistics Canada found that international graduates at all levels of study had on average a 73% full-time employment rate.
	
总而言之，虽然加拿大的劳动力中有更多的国际毕业生，但工作成果在很大程度上是可比的。	In summary, while Canada does have much higher international graduate participance in the workforce, work outcomes are largely comparable.
	
### 移民选项	Immigration options
	
然而，对许多人来说，工作不仅是一种经济保障手段，也是永久移民到学习国家的途径。	However, work for many is not just a means of financial security, but also a path to immigrating permanently to the country of their study.
	
虽然在美国获得永久居留 (PR) 绿卡可能很困难，但加拿大的国际学生永久居留的时间要简单得多——毕业后有通往永久居留权的明确途径。	While attaining a green card for permanent residence (PR) in the U.S. can be difficult, international students in Canada have a much simpler time staying permanently—with clear paths to PR available after graduation.
	
在美国，作为国际学生毕业后获得绿卡的途径通常涉及以下三种途径之一：	In the U.S., the path to a green card after graduation as an international student usually involves one of three pathways:
	
* 申请作为五个“优先”类别之一的移民工人（经济移民），或申请与杰出人才相同的签证；	  Apply as an immigrant worker (economic immigrant) under one of five “preference” categories, or apply themselves for the same visa as a person with extraordinary abilities;
* 申请作为投资移民；或者	  Apply as an immigrant investor; or
* 作为美国公民的配偶/未婚夫申请。	  Apply as the spouse/fiancé of a U.S. citizen.
	
虽然国际学生有多种选择可以暂时延长他们作为外籍工人在美国的逗留时间，但之后获得绿卡的途径较少。需要注意的是，每年有资格获得绿卡的经济移民总数仅为 140,000。）（在所有三个“优先”流之间），获批移民的配偶和子女也计入这一数字。被录取的实际移民人数往往少于规定的最大值。	While there are multiple options that international students can avail to temporarily extend their stay in the U.S. as foreign workers, there are fewer paths to obtaining a green card afterwards. One should note that the annual total of economic immigrants eligible for a green card is only 140,000.) (between all three “preference” streams), with spouses and children of approved immigrants also counting against this number. The actual number of immigrants admitted to this stream tends to be less than the stated maximum.
	
同时，在加拿大，国际学生的移民往往要简单得多。在指定学习机构 (DLI) 学习符合条件的课程（至少一年）的学生可以申请研究生工作许可证 (PGWP)。这是一种开放式工作许可，使毕业生能够在大多数行业和几乎任何雇主工作。在获得至少一年的加拿大工作经验后，国际学生可以通过以下任何途径获得永久居留权：	Meanwhile, in Canada, immigration for international students tends to be much simpler. Students who have studied in an eligible program (minimum one year), at a Designated Learning Institution (DLI) may apply for a Post Graduate Work Permit (PGWP). This is an open work permit that enables graduates to work in most industries, and for almost any employer. After obtaining at least one year of Canadian work experience, international students can pursue any of the following pathways to PR:
	
* Express Entry——特别是加拿大经验类（Canadian Experience Class，CEC）途径，专为具有加拿大工作经验的新移民成为永久居民而设计；	  Express Entry—specifically the Canadian Experience Class (CEC) pathway, which is designed for newcomers with Canadian work experience to become permanent residents;
* 省提名计划，允许特定省提名移民在其省定居，各省通常有专门的国际毕业生流；	  The Provincial Nominee Program, which allows specific provinces to nominate immigrants to settle in their province, with provinces often having specialized streams for international graduates;
* 魁北克移民（独立运作），包括魁北克体验计划，专为有魁北克工作和教育经验的新移民而设计；或者	  Quebec immigration (which operates independently), including the Quebec Experience Program, designed for newcomers who have Quebecois work and education experience; or
* 与加拿大公民或永久居民结婚的新移民的配偶担保。	  Spousal sponsorship for newcomers who have married a Canadian citizen or permanent resident.
	
这些移民机会，加上国际认可的教育机构、优惠的价格、多种经济援助选择和积极的工作成果，使加拿大成为最受追捧的国际学习目的地之一。对于许多人来说，教育代表着通往更美好生活的道路，而加拿大能够通过其移民途径为国际学生提供独一无二的机会。	These immigration opportunities, in conjunction with internationally accredited education institutions, favourable prices, multiple financial aid options, and positive work outcomes have made Canada one of the most widely sought-after international study destinations. For many, education represents a path to a better life, and Canada is uniquely able to give international students this opportunity through its immigration pathways.
