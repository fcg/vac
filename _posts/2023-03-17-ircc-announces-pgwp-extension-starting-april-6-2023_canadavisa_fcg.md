这一消息是今天上午在安大略省怡陶碧谷的亨伯学院举办的一次活动中宣布的。	The announcement was made this morning at an event hosted at Humber College in Etobicoke, Ontario.
	
加拿大移民部长肖恩·弗雷泽 (Sean Fraser) 和怡陶碧谷湖岸区国会议员 (MP) 詹姆斯·马洛尼 (James Maloney) 今天宣布，加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 将允许符合条件的国际学生毕业生持有即将到期的研究生工作许可证 (PGWP)申请最多 18 个月的开放式工作许可 (OWP) 延期。	Canada's Immigration Minister Sean Fraser, joined by Etobicoke-Lakeshore Member of Parliament (MP) James Maloney, announced today that Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) will allow eligible international student graduates who have an expiring Post Graduate Work Permit (PGWP) to apply for an Open Work Permit (OWP) extension of up to 18 months. 
	
符合条件的学生可以从 4 月 6 日起在线申请此延期，所有 2022 年许可证到期（并于去年申请 OWP 延期）的 PGWP 持有人和持有将于 2023 年到期的许可证的人都可以使用.	This extension, which eligible students can apply for online as of April 6, will be available to all PGWP holders who had their permit expire in 2022 (and applied for an OWP extension last year) and those who hold a permit set to expire in 2023.
	
今天的公告是加拿大移民界的一个重要公告，因为 PGWP 越来越成为许多国际学生获得加拿大永久居留权的关键部分。由于此次 PGWP 延期，许可证持有人将能够继续为加拿大经济做出贡献，同时获得最终过渡到加拿大永久居留所需的关键工作经验。	Today's announcement is an important one in the world of Canadian immigration, as the PGWP increasingly becomes a key part of the journey to Canadian permanent residence for many international students. As a result of this PGWP extension, permit holders will be able to continue contributing to the Canadian economy while simultaneously acquiring key work experience necessary for an eventual transition to permanent residence in Canada.
	
**注意：**根据加拿大统计局 2022 年发布的数据，在截至 2018 年的十年间，PGWP 的使用率增长了六倍以上。2008 年，每年新的 PGWP 持有者人数为 10,300 人。到 2018 年，这个数字增长到 64,700。	**Note:** According to Statistics Canada data released in 2022, uptake of the PGWP increased by more than six times over a ten-year period ending in 2018. In 2008, the annual number of new PGWP holders was 10,300. By 2018, this number had grown to 64,700. 
	
**关于PGWP**	**About the PGWP**
	
PGWP 使从加拿大指定学习机构 (DLI) 的合格课程毕业的国际学生能够在加拿大工作**长达三年**（取决于 PGWP 持有人毕业的课程的长度）。	PGWPs enable international student graduates from eligible programs at a Canadian designated learning institution (DLI) to work in Canada for **up to three years** (depending on the length of the program from which the PGWP holder graduated). 
	
获得此许可后的工作时间可用于完成获得加拿大永久居留资格所需的一年加拿大工作经验。	The time spent working after obtaining this permit can be used to fulfill the one year of Canadian work experience required to become eligible for permanent residence in this country. 
	
另外，一般来说，加拿大的很多经济移民项目都会奖励有加拿大工作经验的候选人。这包括在联邦政府的 Express Entry 系统下管理的项目，该系统为在该国拥有工作经验的候选人提供额外的综合排名系统 (CRS) 积分奖励。	Additionally, generally speaking, many of Canada's economic immigration programs reward candidates who have Canadian work experience. This includes the programs managed under the federal government's Express Entry system, which rewards candidates with additional Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) points for having work experience in this country.
	
因此，由于大多数在加拿大的国际学生都表现出最终成为永久居民的愿望，因此 PGWP 已成为许多人在加拿大从临时居留过渡到永久居留的关键部分。	Accordingly, since most international students in Canada display a desire to eventually become a PR, the PGWP has become a key part of many people's transition from temporary residence to permanent residence in Canada. 
	
**注意：** 2022 年，PGWP 持有人占全国所有临时居民到永久居民过渡的大约 82%（98,000 名许可证持有人）	**Note:** In 2022, PGWP holders accounted for roughly 82% of all temporary resident to permanent resident transitions across the country (98,000 permit holders)
