# Lululemon 的成长被官方认可为重大投资项目该公司将能够从 LMIA 流程的豁免中受益。	Lululemon’s growth is officially recognized as a significant investment project The company will be able to benefit from exemptions to the LMIA process.
根据加拿大-不列颠哥伦比亚省移民协议（以下简称“协议”），不列颠哥伦比亚省可以确定将从便利移民措施中受益的重大投资项目；绕过必须提交劳动力市场影响评估 (LMIA) 的能力。	Under the Canada-British Columbia Immigration Agreement (the Agreement), British Columbia can identify significant investment projects that will benefit from a facilitative immigration measure; the ability to bypass having to submit a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA).
	
根据加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 的说法，重大投资项目意味着“对现有公司运营的新尝试，或者是在该省开始运营的公司的进入，这将显着改善该省的劳动力市场或经济，而不会取代加拿大人的工作。”	According to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), a significant investment project means “a new endeavour in an existing firms’ operations or the entrance of a firm that is beginning operations in province that will result in substantial improvement to the provincial labour market or economy, without displacing jobs for Canadians.”
	
Lululemon 是一家成立于加拿大温哥华的运动服装公司。 Lululemon 是一家成长中的全球性公司，在全球拥有超过 600 家公司经营的商店，在 17 个不同的国家/地区拥有 29,000 名员工。	Lululemon is an athletic apparel company founded in Vancouver, Canada. Lululemon is a growing global company, with over 600 total company-operated stores worldwide and 29,000 employees in 17 different countries.
	
2023 年 2 月 28 日，联邦和省政府承认 lululemon 不断增长的员工队伍和全球总部是该协议下的一项重大投资项目。	On February 28th 2023, the federal and provincial government recognized lululemon’s growing workforce and global headquarters as a significant investment project under the Agreement.
	
这意味着对于各种高技能的职业，lululemon 可以聘请外国工人，而无需申请 LMIA。	This means that for a variety of high-skilled occupations, lululemon can hire foreign workers without the requirement to apply for a LMIA.
	
Lululemon 申请了一项重要的投资项目指定，以提供公司在温哥华进行大型公司扩张所需的工人。根据市政事务部的说法，扩建将在不列颠哥伦比亚省维持 3,500 个全职工作岗位，并为经济注入数百万美元。此外，随着这些高技能外国工人将把他们的知识和专长传授给不列颠哥伦比亚人，随着时间的推移，该省的劳动力将会从中受益。	Lululemon requested a significant investment project designation to provide for the workers the company needs for a major company expansion in Vancouver. According to the Ministry of Municipal Affairs, the expansion will sustain 3,500 full time jobs across British Columbia and inject millions of dollars into the economy. In addition, the province’s workforce will see benefits of this over time as these highly skilled foreign workers will transfer their knowledge and expertise to British Columbians.
	
### 什么是劳动力市场影响评估 (LMIA)？	What is a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA)?
	
希望雇用外国工人的加拿大雇主通常需要向加拿大政府提交 LMIA。 LMIA 的目的是确保雇用外国工人将对加拿大劳动力市场产生积极或中立的影响。雇主很可能必须提供证据证明他们试图用合格的加拿大人或永久居民来填补这些职位，但他们没有成功，因此需要雇用外国工人。	An employer in Canada looking to hire a foreign worker often needs to submit an LMIA to the Canada government. The purpose of the LMIA is to ensure that the hiring of the foreign worker will have a positive or neutral effect on the Canadian labour market. Employers will most likely have to provide evidence that they attempted to fill the positions with qualified Canadians or permanent residents, but they were unsuccessful, and therefore needed to hire foreign workers.
	
不需要 LMIA 的外国工人属于国际流动计划 (IMP)。 IMP 的目的是促进加拿大的经济、社会和文化利益。	Foreign workers that do not require an LMIA fall under the International Mobility Program (IMP). The purpose of the IMP is to promote Canada’s economic, social, and cultural interests.
