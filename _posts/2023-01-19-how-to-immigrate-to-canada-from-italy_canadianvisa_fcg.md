!如何在 2023 年从意大利移民到加拿大	!How to Immigrate to Canada from Italy in 2023
	
自 1960 年代以来，意大利人一直移居加拿大，以寻求富裕的经济。最早到加拿大的意大利移民主要定居在多伦多、蒙特利尔和温哥华，但也定居在全国各地的矿业和工业城市。意大利裔加拿大人社区对加拿大的社会、文化和经济结构产生了深远的影响。	Italians have been moving to Canada since the 1960s, in search of a wealthy economy. The earliest Italian immigrants to Canada settled mostly in Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver, but also in mining and industrial cities around the nation. The Italian-Canadian community had a profound impact on Canada's social, cultural, and economic fabric.
	
从那时起，意大利到加拿大的移民运动呈指数级增长。加拿大拥有令人难以置信的意大利裔加拿大人。根据 2021 年的加拿大人口普查，有 1,546,390 人声称拥有全部或部分意大利血统。这占总人口的4.3%。	Since then, there has been exponential growth in the Italy to Canada migration movement. Canada boasts an incredible italian-canadian population. According to the Canadian Census of 2021, 1,546,390 people claimed full or partial Italian ancestry. This constitutes 4.3% of the total population.
	
今天从意大利移民到加拿大比以往任何时候都容易。加拿大开放的移民政策和快速的快速通道系统以及其他著名的移民路线使像您这样的意大利人有可能在大白北地区寻求冒险的生活。	Immigrating to Canada from Italy today is easier than ever. Canada’s open immigration policy and the speedy Express Entry system among other famous immigration routes make it possible for Italians like you to seek a life of adventure in the Great White North.
	
为什么从意大利搬到加拿大？	Why Move to Canada From Italy?
		
居住在加拿大的主要原因之一是社区对意大利侨民的广泛支持。意大利人大量移民加拿大是意大利侨民历史的一部分，这是一场由意大利糟糕的经济状况引发的移民运动，始于 1860 年代，持续了一个多世纪。	One of the major reasons to live in Canada is the wide community support for Italian expats. The huge immigration of Italians to Canada is part of the larger history of the Italian Diaspora, a migratory movement sparked by bad economic conditions in Italy that began in the 1860s and continued for more than a century.  
	
意大利移民在他们的意大利裔加拿大同胞中寻求帮助，以顺利过渡到加拿大的生活，从而在全国建立了持久的社区和组织。随着越来越多的意大利人移民到加拿大，大都市小意大利地区发展壮大。许多志愿团体和俱乐部也由意大利移民组成。	Italian immigrants sought assistance among their fellow Italian-Canadians to smooth the transition to life in Canada, resulting in the establishment of long-lasting communities and organizations across the nation. As more Italians immigrated to Canada, metropolitan Little Italy areas grew and prospered. Many voluntary groups and clubs were also formed by Italian immigrants.
	
意大利移民到加拿大逐渐形成了一个强大的意大利-加拿大社区，这仍然是当今加拿大社会的重要组成部分。除了您将从加拿大人和意大利裔加拿大人那里获得的大力支持外，Great North 还具有更令人向往的品质。	Italian immigration to Canada gradually resulted in the formation of a strong Italian-Canadian community, which remains an important component of Canadian society today. Besides the great support you will receive from Canadians and italian-canadians alike, the Great North has even more desirable qualities.

通过快速通道移民加拿大的 5 个步骤	5 Steps to Immigrate to Canada Through Express Entry
		
加拿大政府使用 Express Entry 管理加拿大永久居留申请，以通过三种经济移民计划填补劳动力短缺：	The Canadian government uses Express Entry to administer Canadian permanent residence applications for filling labor shortages through three economic immigration schemes:  
	
* 联邦技术工人计划 (FSWP)	  Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP)
* 联邦技术贸易计划 (FSTP)	  Federal Skilled Trade Program (FSTP)
* 加拿大经验类 (CEC)	  Canadian Experience Class (CEC)
	
### 第 1 步：检查您的资格	Step 1: Check Your Eligibility
	
在您开始计划您的加拿大之旅之前，您必须根据您的工作、语言能力和教育满足某些要求。	Before you can start planning your trip to Canada, you’ll have to meet certain requirements based on your job, language ability and education.
	
**工作经验**	**Work Experience**
	
为了通过快速入境系统移民到加拿大，如果您是兼职工人，您必须至少有一年的连续全职工作或同等工作经验。您还必须检查您的国家职业分类 (NOC) 代码，您需要用它来确定您的工作属于什么类别。	In order to immigrate to Canada through the Express Entry System, you will have to have at least one year of continuous, full time employment or equivalent work experience if you’re a part time worker. You will also have to check your National Occupation Classification (NOC) code, which you will need to determine what your job is classified under.
	
**语言能力**	**Language Ability**
	
为了在加拿大生活并成功融入职场，您需要了解加拿大的一种国语：法语和英语。您必须提供公认的语言考试，例如国际英语语言测试系统 (IELTS)。您表现出的英语水平以及您的职业也将决定您可以申请哪个快速通道类别。	In order to live in Canada and successfully integrate into the working world, you’ll need to know one of Canada’s national languages: French and English. You’ll have to provide a recognized language exam such as the International English Language Testing System (IELTS). The level of English proficiency you show, as well your occupation, will also determine which Express Entry Stream you can apply for.
	
然后，您将使用加拿大语言基准 (CLB) 系统来计算您的英语或法语分数，作为 IRCC 使用的标准化结果。	You will then use the Canadian Language Benchmark (CLB)  System as a means of calculating your english or french score as a standardised result for IRCC to use.
	
**教育**	**Education**
	
您的教育水平将决定您是否有资格获得某些流。 FSWP 要求您拥有学位，而 FSTP 要求您拥有行业认证。您必须通过公认的权威机构认证您的贸易学位。例如，根据教育证书评估 (ECA)，您必须拥有相当于加拿大标准的学位。对于行业，您必须获得红印章证书，在某些情况下，还必须获得您居住省份的认证。	Your level of education will determine your eligibility for certain streams. The FSWP requires you to have a degree, while the FSTP requires you to have a trade certification. You will have to get your degree of trade certified with a recognised authority. For example, you must have a degree that is equivalent to Canadian standards in accordance with an Educational Credential Assessment (ECA). For Trades, you will have to get a Red Seal Certificate and in some instances, be certified by the province you live in.
	
### 第 2 步：计算您的 CRS 分数	Step 2: Calculate Your CRS Score
	
您的综合排名系统 (CRS) 分数决定了您是否会被管理机构加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 邀请申请永久居留权。您的 CRS 分数将根据年龄、教育程度、语言能力、您是否在加拿大有工作或家庭等因素计算。	Your Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) score is what determines whether you’ll be invited to apply for Permanent Residency by the governing authority Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC). Your CRS score will be calculated based on age, education, language ability, whether you have a job or family in Canada, and more.
	
### 第 3 步：收集您的文件	Step 3: Gather Your Documents
	
要申请加拿大永久居留权，您需要提供以下文件：	In order to apply for permanent residency in Canada, you’ll need to provide the following documentation:
	
*   有效护照	  Valid Passport
* 国家代码	  NOC Code
* 非洲经委会报告	  ECA report
* 语言测试结果	  Language test results
* 证明您有足够结算资金的资金证明	  Proof of funds that show you have sufficient settlement funds
* 警方证明	  Police certificate
* 显示您身体健康的医疗报告	  Medical reports that show you are in good health
* 以前工作经验的证明（以雇主来信的形式）	  Proof of previous work experience (in the form of letters from employers)
* 加拿大工作机会，如果你有一份工作排队	  Canadian job offer, if you have a job lined up
* 来自加拿大省的省提名，如果您拥有	  Provincial Nomination from canadian province, if you possess one
	
### 第 4 步：创建您的快速通道配置文件	Step 4: Create Your Express Entry Profile
	
如果您拥有所有文件并对您的 CRS 分数感到满意，请在加拿大政府网站上创建您的快速通道个人资料。确保您尽可能真实准确地填写所有信息。	Create your Express Entry profile on the Canadian government website if you have all of your papers and are pleased with your CRS score. Ensure you fill in all the information as truthfully and accurately as possible.
	
在这个过程中需要帮助吗？我们的受监管的加拿大移民顾问 (RCIC) 会在这里协助您完成申请流程。	Need help with this process? Our Regulated Canadian Immigration Consultants (RCIC) are here to assist you through your application process.
	
### 第五步：申请永久居留权	Step 5: Apply For Permanent Residency
	
一旦您的 Express Entry 个人资料完成，请留意 Express Entry 抽签，了解最低要求是什么，以及您是否有资格获得申请邀请 (ITA)，这将允许您申请公关。在收到 ITA 后，您将有 60 天的时间支付处理费用并提交所有支持文件。	Once your Express Entry profile is complete, keep an eye out on the Express Entry draw  to see what the minimum requirement is, and whether or not you’ll be eligible to get your Invitation to Apply (ITA), which will allow you to apply for PR. You'll have 60 days after receiving your ITA to pay your processing costs and submit all of your supporting papers.
	
检查您的资格	Check Your Elegibility
	
通往加拿大的替代路线	Alternative Routes to Canada
		
加拿大有超过 100 条不同的移民和签证路线，快速通道系统只是其中之一。每年，许多人也通过这些项目移民到加拿大：	Canada has over 100 different immigration and visa routes, and the Express Entry System is only one of them. Every year, many people immigrate to Canada through these programs too:  
	
### 大西洋移民计划 (AIP)	Atlantic Immigration Program (AIP)
	
这条移民路线适用于在加拿大学习但希望在加拿大大西洋地区生活和工作的有才华的外国雇员和国际毕业生：新不伦瑞克、新斯科舍、爱德华王子岛和纽芬兰与拉布拉多。	This immigration route is intended for talented foreign employees and international graduates who are studying in Canada but want to live and work in Canada's Atlantic regions: New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland & Labrador.
	
该倡议还可以作为公司寻找外国技术员工以解决该省劳动力短缺问题的筛选工具。	The initiative also functions as a screening tool for firms searching for foreign skilled employees to address labour shortages in the province.
	
### 省提名计划 (PNP)	Provincial Nomination Program (PNP)
	
省提名计划 (PNP) 既是一项移民计划，也是一种可能为您的 CRS 分数增加 600 分的方法。这几乎可以保证您将在下一次开奖时获得 ITA。加拿大不同省份需要具有不同技能的外国雇员，因为加拿大在特定地区的劳动力无法填补一些劳动力市场空缺。因此，加拿大 13 个省中的 11 个都可以使用 PNP。	A Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) is both an immigration program and a way to possibly add up to 600 points to your CRS score. This virtually guarantees that you will obtain your ITA at the next draw. Diverse provinces in Canada demand foreign employees with different skill sets since Canada's workforce in particular areas cannot fill some of the labor market vacancies. As a result, PNPs are available in 11 of Canada's 13 provinces.
	
要获得省提名资格，您必须在提名您的省居住和工作。获得提名在很大程度上取决于您的职业以及该省是否有需求。	To be eligible for a provincial nomination, you must reside and work in the province that nominated you. Obtaining a nomination is heavily influenced by your occupation and whether or not it is in demand in that province.

从意大利移居加拿大	Move to Canada From Italy
	
20 世纪末，成千上万的意大利国民通过加拿大的家庭网络和劳动力短缺来到加拿大。尽管意大利移民在抵达加拿大时面临各种障碍，但最终形成了一个欣欣向荣的意大利-加拿大社区，为国家的发展做出了巨大贡献。	Hundreds of thousands of Italian nationals came to Canada In the late 20th century through familial networks and labor shortages in Canada. Despite the fact that Italian immigrants faced a variety of hurdles upon their arrival in Canada, a thriving Italian-Canadian community ultimately evolved, considerably contributing to the nation's development.

常见问题	FAQs
	
### 我可以和家人一起搬到加拿大吗？	Can I Move to Canada With my Family?
	
是的。你应该知道，如果你或你的伴侣或配偶获得签证，其他家庭成员可以陪同他们。因此，作为伴侣，您可能希望提交两个申请，因为您永远不知道谁获得签证的机会更大。	Yes. You should be aware that if you or your partner or spouse has been granted a visa, the rest of the family can accompany them. As a result, as partners, you may wish to file two applications because you never know who has a higher chance of getting the visa.
	
### 加拿大有多冷？	How Cold Does it Get in Canada?
	
除了该国西海岸的不列颠哥伦比亚省外，加拿大冬季平均气温达不到0摄氏度。该国许多地区的气温可低至 -30°C 或 -40°C，这让外出变得不愉快。然而，冬季也是玩雪橇、靠火取暖和参加冬季节日的最佳时机。	Apart from the country's west coast in British Columbia, the average winter temperature in Canada does not reach 0 degrees Celsius. Many regions of the nation can experience temperatures as low as -30°C or -40°C, making stepping outside unpleasant. However, the winter months are also the perfect time for sledding, keeping warm by the fire and attending winter festivals.
	
### 加拿大有意大利菜吗？	Does Canada Have Italian Food?
	
当然！许多菜肴和消遣，如意大利面条和滚球，都是由意大利裔加拿大人引入加拿大的，他们也支持多元主义，使加拿大成为一个更富裕的国家。小意大利位于学院街，以其标志性的比萨饼店、饮食店和冰淇淋店以及外国餐馆和农产品市场而闻名。	Of course! Many dishes and pastimes, such as spaghetti and bocci ball, were introduced to Canada by Italian Canadians, who also supported pluralism, making Canada a wealthier country. Little Italy, located on College Street, is known for its iconic pizzerias, trattorias, and gelato businesses, as well as foreign eateries and produce markets.
