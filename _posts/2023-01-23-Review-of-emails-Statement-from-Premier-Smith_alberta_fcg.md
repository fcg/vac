“我对我的员工的诚信和专业精神充满信心。这就是为什么我感谢公共服务委员会本周末完成的无党派审查，该审查没有发现总理办公室与皇家检察官之间的联系记录。	“I am confident in the integrity and professionalism of my staff. That’s why I am grateful for the non-partisan review completed this weekend by the Public Service Commission, which found no records of contact between the Premier’s Office and Crown prosecutors.

“我完全相信公共服务部门进行了彻底和全面的审查。我要感谢他们对这件事的认真态度，以及他们在过去几天里不间断工作的承诺，为艾伯塔人提供结果以消除他们的担忧。	“I have full faith that the public service conducted a thorough and comprehensive review. I would like to thank them for the seriousness with which they took this matter as well as their commitment to working non-stop over the past number days to provide Albertans with results to put their concerns to rest.

“不受政治干预的独立皇家检察机关是维护公众对司法系统信心不可或缺的一部分。	“An independent Crown prosecution service, free from political interference, is integral to the preservation of public confidence in the justice system.

“我们要求媒体和公众在开展重要工作时也尊重他们的独立性。”	“We ask the media and public to also respect their independence as they carry out their important work.”
