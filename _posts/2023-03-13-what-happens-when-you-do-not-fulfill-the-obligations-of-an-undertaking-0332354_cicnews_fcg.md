# 如果您不履行赞助承诺的义务会怎样？一项承诺在法律上将加拿大担保人与其受抚养人联系在一起，无论是经济上还是非经济上。阅读下文以了解当该具有法律约束力的协议被破坏时会发生什么。	What happens when you do not fulfill the obligations of a sponsorship undertaking? An undertaking legally ties a Canadian sponsor to their dependant, both financially and not. Read below to understand what happens when that legally binding agreement is broken.
担保承诺是一份由担保人签署的合同，声明他们将对其受抚养配偶、同居伴侣、子女、父母或祖父母承担责任。	A sponsorship undertaking is a contract, signed by the sponsor, that states they are taking on responsibility for their dependent spouse, common-law partner, child/children, parent or grandparent.
	
企业定义的责任范围既包括非财务的，也包括财务的，包括食物、住所和衣服——以及其他生活需求。	The scope of responsibility defined by an undertaking is both non-financial and financial, including such things as food, shelter, and clothing — among other living needs.
	
由于受担保的受抚养人不享有与加拿大公民或永久居民相同的获得政府支持（例如社会援助或残疾）的权利，因此承诺还要求加拿大担保人偿还受抚养人从省政府申请和收到的任何款项或联邦政府。适当地，一项承诺成为发起人的重大财务承诺。	Because a sponsored dependant does not have the same rights to access government support such as social assistance or disability as a Canadian citizen or permanent resident, an undertaking also requires that the Canadian sponsor pays back any money that a dependant applies for and receives from the provincial or federal government. Appropriately, an undertaking becomes a significant financial commitment for the sponsor.

虽然承诺的期限因受抚养人与其担保人的关系以及他们选择的定居地点而异，但重要的是要记住，即使受抚养人获得加拿大公民身份，承诺也不会在法定期限正式结束之前终止。	While the length of an undertaking varies by the dependent individual’s relationship to their sponsor and their chosen settlement location, it is vital to remember that an undertaking does not end until the official end of the legal period, even if the dependant acquires Canadian citizenship.
	
承诺中的差异示例包括以下内容。配偶或同居伴侣的承诺期为三年，而通过父母和祖父母计划 (PGP) 担保父母或祖父母则包括 20 年的承诺协议。魁北克存在更多差异，其中 PGP 承诺是 10 年承诺。	Examples of the variance in an undertaking include the following. A spouse or common-law partner undertaking is three years, while sponsoring a parent or grandparent through the Parents and Grandparents Program (PGP) includes a 20-year undertaking agreement. Further variance exists in Quebec, where a PGP undertaking is a 10-year commitment.
	
无论具体情况如何，信守承诺的重要性都不可低估。不过，有时赞助商无法或选择不履行与其赞助责任相关的条款。例如，这种情况可能包括一对夫妇变得疏远或离婚。如果发生这种情况并且赞助商停止履行其义务，则个人将违约赞助，这可能会导致重大后果。	Regardless of the specific circumstance, the importance of honouring an undertaking cannot be understated. Still, there may come a time when a sponsor is unable or chooses not to fulfill the terms associated with their sponsorship responsibility. Such circumstances may include a couple becoming estranged or getting divorced, for example. If this occurs and a sponsor stops fulfilling their obligations, the individual will have defaulted on the sponsorship, which can lead to significant consequences.
	
### 什么是赞助默认值？	What is a sponsorship default?
	
当赞助商没有履行赞助的财务义务时，就会发生赞助违约。如果发起人违反与承诺本身相关的合同义务或未能履行任何必要的财务或非财务义务，就会发生这种情况。	A sponsorship default occurs when the sponsor has not met the financial obligations of the sponsorship. This can take place if a sponsor either breaches the contractual obligations involved with the undertaking itself or fails to fulfill any required obligations, either financial or non-financial.
	
当赞助义务停止履行时，通常是赞助中断的结果。担保失败的原因多种多样，包括无法解决的纠纷（人际冲突）、受抚养人情况的变化导致担保条款无法履行（婚姻分居）或担保人未履行某些承诺义务，例如提供安置支持.	When sponsorship obligations stop being met, it is typically the result of a sponsorship breakdown. Sponsorship breakdowns can occur for a variety of reasons, which include unresolvable disputes (interpersonal conflicts), a change in the dependant’s situation that makes the sponsorship terms impossible to fulfill (marital separation) or a sponsor not fulfilling certain undertaking obligations such as providing settlement support.
	
### 违约赞助的处罚	Penalties for defaulting on a sponorship
	
赞助违约可能导致赞助商受到几种不同的处罚。	A sponsorship default can result in several different penalties for the sponsor.
	
例如，特别是担保人有义务支付与向其受抚养人提供的社会援助相关的任何费用，未能履行这一具体义务将限制加拿大担保人担任任何其他新移民的担保人，直到还清这笔债务.	For instance, particular to the sponsor’s obligation to cover any costs associated with social assistance given to their dependant(s), failure to meet this specific obligation will restrict the Canadian sponsor from acting as a sponsor for any other newcomers until this debt is paid off.
	
更一般地说，违约的一个潜在后果是对违约责任人采取法律行动。虽然加拿大政府采取的法律行动并不总是发生在担保破裂时，但主要担保人及其共同签署人如果违约，都可能面临法律后果。	More generally, one potential consequence of defaulting on an undertaking is legal action taken against the person(s) responsible for the default. While legal action pursued by the Canadian government does not always occur upon the breakdown of sponsorship, both the primary sponsor as well as their co-signer(s) could face legal consequences if they default on their undertaking.
