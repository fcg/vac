IRCC 和加拿大各省继续合作欢迎乌克兰人 俄罗斯入侵开始一年后，乌克兰人仍然受益于独特的移民途径、额外的定居服务和免税福利	IRCC and Canada’s provinces continue working together to welcome Ukrainians One year after the Russian invasion began, Ukrainians still benefit from a unique immigration pathway, extra settlement services and non-taxable benefits
	
今天是俄罗斯入侵乌克兰一周年。	Today marks one year since the beginning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
	
联合国难民署报告称，自 2022 年 2 月以来，乌克兰已有超过 700 万人流离失所。其中许多人已逃往波兰和摩尔多瓦等邻国，但其他人则决定前往更远的国家，包括加拿大。	UNHCR reports more than 7 million people in Ukraine have been displaced since February 2022. Many of them have fled to neighbouring countries such as Poland and Moldova, but others decide to go further abroad, including Canada.
	
### 加拿大为流离失所的乌克兰人做了什么？	What is Canada doing for displaced Ukrainians?
	
加拿大在危机时期援助难民和其他流离失所者的历史由来已久。例如，加拿大在 2015 年 11 月至 2016 年 2 月期间重新安置了 25,000 名叙利亚难民，并承诺在塔利班接管后协助 40,000 名阿富汗难民。到目前为止，来自加拿大移民难民和公民部 (IRCC) 的最新数据显示，已有 28,285 名阿富汗人在所有移民流中抵达加拿大。	Canada has a long history of assisting refugees and other displaced people in times of crisis. For example, Canada resettled 25,000 Syrian refugees between November 2015 and February 2016 and has committed to assisting 40,000 Afghan refugees following the Taliban takeover. So far, the latest data from Immigration Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) says 28,285 Afghans have arrived in Canada under all immigration streams.
	
加拿大对流离失所的乌克兰人采取了略有不同的做法。他们不是以难民身份将他们带过来，而是更多地根据加拿大-乌克兰紧急旅行授权 (CUAET) 抵达加拿大。	Canada has taken a slightly different approach with displaced Ukrainians. Instead of bringing them over as refugees, they are more often arriving in Canada under the Canada-Ukraine Authorization for Emergency Travel (CUAET).
	
根据 CUAET，乌克兰人及其任何国籍的直系亲属可以作为临时居民在加拿大逗留长达三年。申请访客签证是免费的，他们可以同时免费申请开放式工作许可证。然而，所有前往加拿大的旅行都是自费的，这对许多乌克兰人造成了重大障碍。到目前为止，在收到的 862,386 份申请中，加拿大已经批准了 559,868 份申请，并且有超过 167,000 名乌克兰人抵达加拿大。	Under CUAET Ukrainians and their immediate family members of any nationality may stay in Canada as temporary residents for up to three years. There are no fees to apply for a visitor visa, and they may apply for an open work permit simultaneously, at no cost. However, all travel to Canada is self-funded which creates significant barriers for many Ukrainians. So far, Canada has approved 559,868 applications out of the 862,386 received and just over 167,000 Ukrainians have arrived in Canada.
	
Ukrainan Canadian Congress 首席执行官 Ihor Michalchyshyn 向_CIC News_ 谈到了 IRCC 对乌克兰危机的反应。	Ukrainan Canadian Congress CEO Ihor Michalchyshyn spoke  to _CIC News_ about IRCC’s response to the Ukraine crisis.
	
**“**到目前为止，对于大多数人来说，这是一次非常临时但又成功的欢迎，”他说。他将成功归功于联邦政府的收入支持、省政府提供的住房、培训和语言支持，以及社区对融合和欢迎人们的关注。	**“**Its been a very adhoc but yet successful welcome thus far for most people,” he says. He credits the success to the combination of the federal government income support, provincial governments with the housing, training and language supports and also community focus on integration and welcoming people.
	
Michalchyshyn 说，IRCC 仍然存在一些挑战和方法可以更好地帮助乌克兰新移民。	Michalchyshyn says there still some challenges and ways in which IRCC could better assist Ukrainian newcomers.
	
“其中一个挑战当然是数据。这是自费旅行，我们真的不知道人们要去哪里，什么时候去。它实际上依赖于定居机构和坐在机场的志愿者试图欢迎人们并寻找人们。我们现在正在获取一些数据，了解人们在哪里注册医疗保健或一次性收入福利的收入支付。我们需要更多关于人们到达哪里以及他们的需求的数据。 “	“One of the challenges of course is data. It’s self funded travel and we don’t really know where people are going and when. It’s really relies on settlement agencies and volunteers sitting in airports trying to welcome people and find people. We’re getting some data now about where people are registering for healthcare or income disbursement from the one-time income benefit. We need more data about where people are arriving and what their needs are. “
	
他还表示，CUAET 的临时性质给新移民在获取某些政府服务方面带来了挑战。	He also says the temporary nature of the CUAET poses challenges for newcomers when it comes to accessing some government services.
	
该计划将于今年 3 月 31 日停止接受申请，尽管一些安置服务机构以及 UCC 请求政府延长日期，因为无法知道冲突何时结束。	The program is set to stop accepting applications on March 31 this year although several settlement services, as well as the UCC, petitioned the government to extend the date because there is no way to know when the conflict will end.
	
### 其他支持措施	Other support measures
	
IRCC优先处理所有CUAET申请，服务标准为14天。	IRCC has priority processing for all CUAET applications, with a service standard of 14 days.
	
联邦政府还为 CUAET 参与者提供每名成人 3,000 美元的一次性非应税福利，并为每名 17 岁以下儿童额外提供 1,500 美元。该福利计划将于 2023 年 6 月 4 日到期。乌克兰新移民不会收到除福利外的任何额外安置资金。	The federal government also offers a one-time non-taxable benefit of $3,000 each per adult and an additional $1,500 for each child under 17 for CUAET participants. This benefit program is set to expire on June 4, 2023.  Ukrainian newcomers do not receive any additional settlement funding beyond the benefit.
	
省级也有支持措施。例如，曼尼托巴省定期邀请乌克兰候选人申请省提名，这对希望通过“快速通道”计划成为永久居民的乌克兰人非常有利。	Support measures exist on a provincial level too. For example, Manitoba regularly invites candidates from Ukraine to apply for provincial nomination, which is highly beneficial for Ukrainians who wish to become permanent residents through an Express Entry program.
	
不列颠哥伦比亚省取消了为逃离乌克兰战争的学生支付的学习健康费。对于拥有 IRCC 签发的学习许可并注册 MSP（不列颠哥伦比亚省的医疗保健计划）的所有五岁及以上的个人，每月费用为 75 美元。该省还创建了一个网站，在乌克兰新移民初到时为他们提供指导和帮助。	British Columbia has cancelled the study health fee for students who are fleeing the war in Ukraine. The fee is $75 monthly for all individuals five and older enrolled in MSP (British Columbia’s healthcare program) with a study permit issued by IRCC. The province has also created a website to direct and assist newcomers from Ukraine when they first arrive.
	
去年 8 月，新不伦瑞克省大幅降低了新抵达的已经拥有有效乌克兰驾照的乌克兰国民的费用。如果他们有两年以上的驾驶经验，他们可以花 90 美元获得省级乘用车驾照，并且不需要完成考试。他们仍必须提供身份证明文件并接受视力测试。	Last August, New Brunswick introduced significantly reduced costs for recently arrived Ukrainian nationals who already have a valid Ukrainian driver’s license. They can obtain a provincial passenger vehicle license for $90 and do not need to complete a test if they have more than two years of driving experience. They must still provide identification documents and submit to a vision test.
	
安大略省为乌克兰新移民提供了一套支持措施，例如：	Ontario has a suite of support measures for Ukrainian newcomers such as:
	
* 获得安大略省健康保险计划 (OHIP) 的覆盖范围，其中包括他们可能需要的医疗保健支持和服务，包括心理健康服务。	  Access to Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP) coverage which includes health care support and services they may need, including mental health services.
* 乌克兰人通过 OHIP 资格或接受紧急收入援助获得药物福利。	  Access to drug benefits for Ukrainians through OHIP eligibility or receiving emergency income assistance.
* 通过定居服务机构和乌克兰社区组织获得紧急住房，包括在做出长期安排之前乌克兰人可能需要的寄宿家庭和其他临时住所。	  Access to emergency housing through settlement service agencies and Ukrainian community organizations, including host homes and other temporary settings that Ukrainians may need until long-term arrangements are made.
* 确保乌克兰中小学生可以免费上公立学校。	  Ensuring Ukrainian elementary and secondary school students can attend publicly funded schools for free.
	
一些加拿大慈善组织也在努力将乌克兰人带到加拿大并帮助他们定居。其中之一，4Ukraine.ca，报告说他们已经将 500 多人空运到加拿大，帮助创建了 1,000 多份简历，并筹集了超过 275,000 美元的援助。	Several Canadian charitable organizations are also working to bring Ukrainians to Canada and help them settle. One of them, 4Ukraine.ca, reports that they have flown over 500 people to Canada, helped create over 1,000 resumes and have raised over $275,000 in aid.
	
### 加拿大人可以做什么来支持乌克兰新移民	What can Canadians do to support Ukrainian newcomers
	
加拿大政府表示，所有加拿大人都可以捐款和自愿帮助加拿大和国外的乌克兰人。一种方法是为新移民提供住房。每个省都有组织为志愿者匹配乌克兰新移民的住房需求。	Canada’s government says all Canadians can donate and volunteer to assist Ukrainians both in Canada and abroad. One way is to offer housing to newcomers. There are organizations in each province that will match volunteers with the housing needs of Ukrainian newcomers.
	
使用 jobbank.ca 的雇主也可以通过以下几个步骤表明他们想雇用一名乌克兰新移民。	Employers using jobbank.ca can also indicate that they would like to hire a Ukrainian newcomer by following a few steps.
	
* 在工作银行注册为雇主	  Register as an employer on Job Bank
* 创建新的职位发布并将其保存为草稿。	  Create a new job posting and save it as a draft.
* 联系 Job Bank 并附上职位发布的参考编号，让他们知道您想招聘乌克兰国民。	  Contact Job Bank and include the reference number of the job posting to let them know that you want to recruit Ukrainian nationals.
	
Michalchyshyn 说一些公司一直在做大量的工作。 “他们真的利用这个机会来填补乌克兰人的临时劳动力短缺，并与他们一起培养他们的语言技能。”	Michalchyshyn says some companies have been doing tremendous work. “They have really used the opportunity to fill temporary labour shortages with Ukrainians, and to work with them to build their language skills.”
	
语言仍然是许多新移民在根据 CUAET 和专业认证抵达加拿大时面临的最大障碍之一。 “一般来说，除了医疗领域，我都听说过一些好的事情。” Michalchyshyn 说。 “很多人都哭了，因为他们在乌克兰是医生或护士，在这里他们根本无法理解如何开始重新认证的过程。”	Language remains one of  the biggest obstacle many newcomers face when they arrive in Canada under CUAET alongside professional accreditation. “Generally I’ve heard good things except for in the medical field.” says Michalchyshyn. “Those are a lot of the people who have broken down crying because they are doctors or nurses in Ukraine and here its just impossible for them to understand how to begin the process of recertifying.”
	
不过，他说新移民在抵达加拿大时仍然充满希望	Still, he says newcomers remain hopeful as they arrive in Canada
	
“对于乌克兰人民来说，这是坚韧不拔的一年。作为加拿大人，我们致力于支持乌克兰成为反对暴政的民主国家。我们的主要信息是，在这一点上，我们非常感谢乌克兰人民对我们的欢迎。”	 “It’s been a year of resilience for Ukrainian people. As Canadians, we are committed to supporting Ukraine as a democracy against tyranny. Our main message is that we are just thankful at this point that we’ve had such a welcome for the people of the Ukraine.”
