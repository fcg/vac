## 根据加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 最近发布的消息，加拿大正在促进某些 lululemon 员工的雇佣。	Canada is facilitating the hiring of certain lululemon workers, according to a recent release from Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada (IRCC).
	
IRCC 网站上的一则通知称，“对于各种高技能职业，lululemon 可以雇佣外国工人，无需申请劳动力市场影响评估 (LMIA)。”	A notice on the IRCC website says that “for a variety of high-skilled occupations, lululemon can hire foreign workers without needing to apply for a labour market impact assessment (LMIA).”
	
LMIA 是加拿大雇主根据临时外国工人计划雇用外国工人所需的劳动力市场测试。并非所有工作许可都需要它。	An LMIA is a labour market test that Canadian employers need in order to hire foreign workers under the Temporary Foreign Worker Program, specifically. It is not required of all work permits.
	
根据工作许可证，雇主完成 LMIA 流程并将其发送到加拿大就业和社会发展部 (ESDC) 进行评估。如果结果表明雇用外国工人会对劳动力市场产生积极或中性的影响，则雇主可以雇用该工人。	Depending on the work permit, employers complete the LMIA process and send it to Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) to get assessed. If the results show that hiring a foreign worker would have a positive or neutral affect on the labour market, the employer can then hire that worker.
	
LMIA 可能会花费雇主时间和金钱才能完成。因此，它不被认为是雇用外国人才的理想选择。	The LMIA can cost employers time and money in order to complete. For this reason, it is not considered a desirable option for hiring foreign talent.
	
根据 IRCC 发布的消息，Lululemon 正在“被认为是一个重要的投资项目”。根据与联邦政府的双边协议中的一项规定，不列颠哥伦比亚省可以确定重大投资项目，以考虑获得 LMIA 程序的特别豁免。 ESDC 和 IRCC 然后可以评估该项目以确定它是否符合标准。	According to the IRCC release, Lululemon is being “recognized as a significant investment project.” The province of British Columbia can identify significant investment projects for consideration for a special exemption from the LMIA process, according to a provision in their bilateral agreement with the federal government. ESDC and IRCC can then assess the project to determine if it meets the criteria.
	
“将全球人才带到 lululemon 的家乡温哥华，将通过知识共享增强不列颠哥伦比亚省的劳动力，”该新闻稿称，“利用公司的国际足迹，并在未来几年内实现显着的就业增长。”	“Bringing global talent to lululemon’s hometown of Vancouver will enhance British Columbia’s workforce through knowledge sharing,” the release says, “leveraging the company’s international footprint and resulting in significant employment growth over the next several years.”
	
IRCC 表示，他们计划的更多细节预计将在今年春季晚些时候公布。	IRCC says more details of their plans are expected to be communicated later this spring.
	
### Lululemon 2016年向政府发出的呼吁	Lululemon’s 2016 appeal to the government
	
2016 年，Lululemon 向联邦政府提交了预算前报告。在这份文件中，这家价值数十亿美元的服装公司写道，其总部能否留在温哥华取决于临时外国工人计划的变化。	In 2016, Lululemon issued a pre-budget submission to the federal government. In the document, the multi-billion dollar apparel company wrote that its ability to remain headquartered in Vancouver was dependent on changes to the Temporary Foreign Worker Program.
	
Lululemon 的报告称：“[我们的] 增长和我们将总部留在温哥华的能力将要求垂直整合的服装行业获得与电影行业和学术界类似的 LMIA 过渡计划豁免。” “对于特定的 NOC 代码，该行业应免除广告和工资发布要求。”	“\[Our\] growth and our ability to remain headquartered in Vancouver will require that the vertically integrated apparel industry be granted a similar LMIA transition plan exemption as the Film industry and academia,” Lululemon’s report said. “Advertising and wage posting requirements should be waived for this sector for particular NOC Codes.”
	
在报告中，Lululemon 特别建议管理、咨询、设计和销售等某些职业应该像学者和电影行业专业人士一样享受 LMIA 豁免。但是，联邦政府尚未正式列出哪些职业符合条件。	In the report, Lululemon specifically suggested certain occupations in management, consulting, designing, and sales should benefit from an LMIA exemption similar to academics and film industry professionals. However, the federal government has not yet officially listed which occupations would be eligible.
	
### 关于加拿大工作许可	About Canadian work permits
	
加拿大有两大类工作许可：属于临时外国工人计划 (TFWP) 的类别和属于国际流动计划 (IMP) 的类别。	There are two broad work permit categories in Canada: those that fall under the Temporary Foreign Worker Program (TFWP), and those under the International Mobility Program (IMP).
	
TFWP 工作许可需要 LMIA。 LMIA 的要求因工作许可而异。在某些情况下，雇主可能需要发布职位空缺广告，以证明没有加拿大工人能够或愿意填补特定职位空缺。某些计划免除了此广告要求，例如主要面向技术人员的全球人才流 (GTS)。	TFWP work permits require an LMIA. The requirements of the LMIA are different depending on the work permit. In some cases, employers may need to advertise a job openeing in order to demonstrate that there is no Canadian worker able or willing to fill a particular job vacancy. This advertising requirement is waived under some programs such as the Global Talent Stream (GTS), which is primarily for tech workers.
	
雇主不需要通过 LMIA 程序来雇用 IMP 下的工人，其中包括工作许可，例如工作假期签证和其他加拿大国际经验 (IEC) 计划。	Employers do not need to do the LMIA process to hire workers coming under the IMP, which includes work permits such as the Working Holiday Visa and other International Experience Canada (IEC) programs.
	
LMIA 通常是特定雇主工作许可所必需的，因为 IMP 下的开放式工作许可允许工人为加拿大任何地方的任何公司工作。	The LMIA is typically required for employer-specific work permits, where as open work permits under the IMP allow workers to work for any company anywhere in Canada.
