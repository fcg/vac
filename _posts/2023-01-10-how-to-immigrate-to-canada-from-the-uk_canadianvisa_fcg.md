英国公民在能够移民到加拿大方面处于独特的地位，因为这两个国家拥有相同的国家元首并且属于同一个合作国家集团：英联邦。这使得英国人更容易移居加拿大，尤其是在获得永久居留权 (PR) 身份方面。	UK citizens are in a unique position of being able to immigrate to Canada since both countries have the same head of state and are part of the same co-operative group of nations: the Commonwealth. This makes it easier for British people to move to Canada especially with regards to receiving permanent residency(PR) status.
	
### 快速入境计划	The Express Entry Program
	
最受欢迎的项目是快速通道。对于那些寻求快速且相对轻松的移民过程的人来说，这是最简单的方法。完成此过程大约需要六个月或更长的时间。它主要涉及三个与工作相关的移民项目：联邦技术贸易项目（FSTP）、联邦技术工人项目（FSWP）和加拿大经验类项目（CEC）。	The most popular program is the Express Entry. For those looking for a quick and relatively hassle-free process of immigrating, this is the easiest method of doing so. It takes approximately six months and upwards for this process to be completed. It involves primarily three work-related immigration programs: the Federal Skilled Trades Program (FSTP), Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP), and the Canadian Experience Class (CEC).
	
这些计划在加拿大注册移民顾问 (RCIC) 和加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 的协助下，帮助加拿大企业与具有移民加拿大所需工作经验的潜在新移民建立联系。	These programs, with the facilitation of Registered Canadian Immigration Consultants (RCIC)  and Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), help connect Canadian businesses to prospective newcomers with the required work experience to immigrate to Canada.

### 省提名项目	The Provincial Nominee Programs
	
PNP 是与加拿大各省的劳动力资源需求相关的选择性移民计划，也是英国公民的主要移民来源，因为他们通常是高技能和受过教育的民众。这是 PNP 及其不同流的完整分类。	PNPs are selective immigration programs tied to the labour resource needs of each Canadian province and are also a major source of immigration for British citizens since they are a generally high-skilled and educated populace. Here's a full breakdown of the PNPs and their different streams.

英国人移民加拿大有着悠久的历史记录。长期以来，文化纽带和传统规定，在移民方面必须优先考虑持有英国护照的人。这种偏好反映在相对较多的英国受试者中，他们要么在加拿大有家庭关系，要么有工作经验。	British immigration to Canada has a long historical record. Cultural ties and tradition had long dictated that those who had a British passport must be given preference with regards to immigration. This preference is reflected in the relatively high number of British subjects who either have family ties or work experience in Canada.
	
对于那些有家庭关系的人，它建议他们通过 IRCC 官方网站或附属移民咨询公司创建注册档案来申请快速入境系统。 CanadianVisa 是一家关联移民咨询公司，拥有知名 RCIC 代理名册，将根据您的个人人口统计数据进行评估，例如家庭关系，然后将结果计算到综合排名系统（CRS）中。该评估还将表明您是否有资格移民加拿大。	For those with family ties, it advised that they apply for the Express Entry system by creating a registered profile via the official IRCC site or an affiliate immigration consultancy. CanadianVisa, which is an affiliate immigration consultancy company with a roster of reputable RCIC agents will conduct an evaluation based on your personal demographic data, e.g. family ties and after which the results are calculated into a Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS). This evaluation will also indicate whether or not you are eligible to immigrate to Canada.

CRS 分数对那些优先成为快速通道计划接受者的人有很大影响，而家庭关系对此分数有重大贡献。	CRS scores have a lot of influence on those who are prioritized to be recipients of the Express Entry program and family ties have a significant contribution to this score.
	
对于目前在加拿大生活和工作的人来说，CEC 是快速获得快速入境计划资格的最佳选择。它优先考虑那些：	For those currently living and working in Canada, the CEC is the best option to quickly qualify for an Express Entry program. It prioritizes those with:
	
* 之前在加拿大的工作经验	  Prior work experience in Canada
* 通过向他们发出申请邀请 (ITA)，在加拿大获得工作机会或精通英语或法语。	  A job offer in Canada or a high proficiency and fluency in English or French by issuing them invitations to apply (ITA’s).
* 一旦被接受，这些邀请将让您快速获得永久居留身份。	  When accepted, these invitations fast-track you towards receiving permanent residency status.
	
对于那些与加拿大有家庭或工作关系的人，请在申请 CEC 或 PNP 计划时利用这一优势。	For those with familial or work ties to Canada, use this to your advantage in your application either for CEC or PNP program.
