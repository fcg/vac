超过 430,000 名新移民通过快速入境系统被邀请到加拿大	Over 430,000 Newcomers Invited To Canada Via Express Entry System
	
2022 年对于加拿大移民部门来说是具有历史意义的一年。它记录了 431,645 名新移民被邀请移民加拿大。这一成就超过了此前在 2021 年创下的 405,000 人的记录。	The year 2022 was a historic year for the Canadian immigration department. It recorded 431,645 newcomers invited to immigrate to Canada. This achievement surpasses the previous record of 405,000 in 2021.
	
2015 年引入的快速通道系统作为处理移民申请的快速方法对获得这一成就非常有利。通过提高劳动人口的集体技能和专业知识水平，从而提高质量生产力，这对经济产生了积极影响。	The introduction of the Express Entry system in 2015 as a fast-track method of processing immigrant applications has been very beneficial towards obtaining this achievement. This has made a positive impact on the economy by increasing the collective skill and expertise level of the working population, which leads to greater qualitative productivity.

加拿大签证处理时间更新	Updates In Canadian Visa Processing Times
	
由于 IRCC 仅在 2022 年就处理了超过 480 万份申请，因此积压的申请显着减少。这一成就符合加拿大政府到 2023 年底邀请 50 万移民新移民的目标。加拿大移民、难民和公民部部长肖恩·弗雷泽 (Sean Fraser) 代表其部门对不懈努力表示感谢IRCC 员工。签证申请处理时间预计在未来几年将增加到更高的速度。根据弗雷泽的说法：	The backlog of applications was reduced significantly as the IRCC processed over 4.8 million applications in 2022 alone. This achievement is in line with the Canadian governments’ aim to invite 500,000 immigrant newcomers to its shores by the end of 2023. The Canadian Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship, the honorable Sean Fraser on behalf of his department expressed gratitude to the tireless efforts of IRCC employees. Visa Application Processing times are expected to increase to a higher rate in the coming years. According to Fraser:
	
> “如果没有加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 的员工，就不可能取得这一令人难以置信的成就，他们继续为处理设置更高的标准”~ Sean Fraser	> “This incredible achievement would not have been possible without the employees of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), who continue to set the bar higher for processing” ~ Sean Fraser
