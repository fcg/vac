加拿大如何从更广泛的移民定居点分布中受益 更多加拿大移民正在多伦多、温哥华和蒙特利尔以外的地方定居。这对加拿大的经济增长来说是个好消息。	How Canada may benefit from a broader immigrant settlement distribution More Canadian immigrants are settling outside of Toronto, Vancouver, and Montreal. This is good news for economic growth across Canada.
	
加拿大是一个移民历史上主要定居在三个主要地点的国家——多伦多、温哥华和蒙特利尔。	Canada is a country where immigrants have historically settled in three primary locations – Toronto, Vancouver, and Montreal.
	
2021 年，29.5% 的加拿大新移民——那些在 2016 年至 2021 年间来到加拿大的移民——定居在多伦多，而 12.2% 的人定居在蒙特利尔，略低于该比例 (11.7%) 的人决定将温哥华作为他们的第一个加拿大家乡城市。	In 2021, 29.5% of recent Canadian immigrants — those who came to Canada between 2016 and 2021 — landed in Toronto while 12.2% settled in Montreal and a shade less than that (11.7%) decided to call Vancouver their first Canadian home city.
	
这是一种在过去 50 年中一直存在的趋势。例如，追溯到 1999 年的人口普查数据表明，在过去的四分之一个世纪中，在三个不同的选定年份——1999 年、2001 年和 2006 年——每年都有超过 68% 的移民决定在这三个城市定居。	This is a trend that has presented itself consistently over the last 50 years. For instance, census numbers going back to 1999 indicate that, in three different chosen years — 1999, 2001 and 2006 — over the last quarter-century, more than 68% of immigrants in each year decided to settle in those three cities.
	
然而，根据 2021 年加拿大人口普查，这一现实现在开始发生变化。	However, this reality is now starting to shift, according to the 2021 Canadian census.
	
### 加拿大各地正在发生什么？	What is happening across Canada?
	
加拿大统计局最近的人口普查数据表明，“在加拿大三大城市中心定居的新移民比例\[继续\]下降。”在最新人口普查数据的五年报告期内（2016 年至 2021 年），定居在这三个城市之一的登陆移民的比例下降了 2.6%，从 56.0% 下降到 53.4%。蒙特利尔是人口普查大都市区 (CMA)，其移民定居总数下降幅度最大，移民比例从 2016 年的 14.8% 下降到 2021 年的 12.2%。	Data from Statistics Canada’s most recent census indicates that “the share of recent immigrants who have settled in Canada’s three largest urban centres \[continues\] to decline.” The percentage of landed immigrants settling in one of the three cities fell 2.6% — from 56.0% to 53.4% — over the five-year reporting period (2016 to 2021) for the latest census data. Montreal was the Census Metropolitan Area (CMA) that experienced the largest drop-off in total immigrant settlement, where the share of immigration dipped from 14.8% in 2016 to 12.2% in 2021.
	
与此同时，越来越多的新移民选择在多伦多、蒙特利尔和温哥华以外的地方定居。事实上，渥太华-加蒂诺地区的移民定居率增长了 1.3%（2016 年为 3.1%，2021 年为 4.4%）。此外，被称为基奇纳-剑桥-滑铁卢的 CMA 在同一时间段内的移民比例几乎翻了一番（1.2% 至 2.1%），而超过 3% 的新移民同时落户“小城市”（4.4%）和“农村” ” (3.2%) 领域也在 2021 年。	Meanwhile, an increasing number of recent immigrants are choosing to settle outside of Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver. In fact, the Ottawa-Gatineau region saw a 1.3% growth in immigrant settlement (3.1% in 2016 to 4.4% in 2021). Moreover, the CMA known as Kitchener-Cambridge-Waterloo nearly doubled its percentage of immigrants (1.2% to 2.1%) over the same time frame while over three percent of recent immigrants landed in both “small urban” (4.4%) and “rural” (3.2%) areas in 2021 as well.
	
在更大的范围内，新移民也正在向加拿大各地的不同省份扩散。与之前的人口普查相比，2021 年有五个省份的新移民比例有所增加。在加拿大最新人口普查的五年报告期内，安大略省的新移民比例从 39%（2016 年）上升到 44%（2021 年）。在同一时间段内，不列颠哥伦比亚省的移民从 14.5% 上升到 14.9%，而新斯科舍省（1% 到 1.6%）、新不伦瑞克省（0.8% 到 1.2%）和爱德华王子岛（0.3%）的移民定居也有所改善至 0.4%）。	On a larger scale, recent immigrants are also spreading out to different provinces across Canada. In 2021, five provinces saw their share of recent immigrants increase compared to previous censuses. Over the five-year reporting period included in the latest Canadian census, Ontario’s share of recent immigrants went up from 39% (2016) to 44% (2021). Over the same timeframe, immigration to British Columbia was up from 14.5% to 14.9%, while immigrant settlement also improved in Nova Scotia (1% to 1.6%), New Brunswick (0.8% to 1.2%) and Prince Edward Island (0.3% to 0.4%).
	
### 这种新移民分布对加拿大意味着什么？	What does this new immigrant distribution mean for Canada?
	
出于与加拿大在 1998 年推出省提名计划 (PNP) 相同的原因，加拿大各地的广泛移民通过该国较小地区的经济发展使整个国家受益。	For the very same reasons that Canada introduced its Provincial Nominee Programs (PNPs) in 1998, widespread immigration across Canada benefits the entire country through economic development in smaller regions of the country.
	
随着越来越多的移民通过 11 个 PNP 中的一个或其他移民途径在加拿大的不同地区定居，这些新移民将有助于解决他们居住地区特定的劳动力市场需求。自然地，这将导致这些地区的经济增长，因为新移民就业、赚钱，然后花钱又回到经济中。这方面的证据可以在现实中找到，据说移民在 2016 年至 2021 年期间对加拿大劳动力增长的 79.9% 做出了贡献。	As more immigrants settle in diverse areas of Canada, either through one of 11 PNPs or another immigration pathway, these newcomers will help address labour market needs specific to the area they live in. Naturally, this will result in economic growth within those regions, as new immigrants become employed, earn money, and subsequently spend money that goes back into the economy. Evidence of this can be found in the reality that immigration is said to have contributed to 79.9% of Canada’s labour force growth between 2016 and 2021.
	
此外，新移民将继续纳税，同时将钱花在住房、交通和其他必需品上，从而进一步促进全国各地近期移民激增的地区的经济增长。	Additionally, newcomers will continue to pay taxes while spending money on housing, transportation, and other necessities, further allowing the economy to grow in the places across the country that are seeing a recent boom in immigration.
	
最终，加拿大各地这些新移民定居点的增长将使整个国家受益，因为加拿大更多地区的经济和发展将变得繁荣，这将有助于加强加拿大的整体实力。	Ultimately, the growth experienced by these new immigrant settlement destinations across Canada will therefore benefit the country at large because more parts of Canada will become economically and developmentally prosperous, which will help strengthen Canada in its entirety.
