想象一下这样一种情况，在经过多轮面试后，有两名候选人正在考虑一份工作——而你是其中之一。	Imagine a situation where there are two candidates being considered for a job after multiple rounds of interviews — and you are one of them.
	
在最后一轮，只有一个人拿到了 offer，而你非常想要那个职位。那么你如何确保你能晋级并获得录取通知书呢？继续阅读，发现成为被选中的人是多么简单。	In the final round, only one person gets the offer and you desperately want that position. So how do you make sure that you will make the cut and get the offer letter? Read on and find how simple it is to become the chosen one.
	
招聘人员在两名看起来很合格的候选人之间进行选择的方法之一是超越工作所需的资格匹配。他们将深入挖掘，寻找更精细的细节，并评估每位候选人如何展示长期技能。一些关键考虑因素可能包括以下内容。	One of the ways recruiters select between two candidates who seem well-qualified is to look beyond the qualification match wanted for the job. They will dig deeper, look for finer details and evaluate how each candidate demonstrates skills for the long term. Some key considerations could include the following.
	
**1\.文化契合**	**1\. Cultural fit**
	
“文化契合度”着眼于候选人与组织工作风格无缝融合的能力。这意味着要问：最后一轮的候选人中哪一位带来了一套独特的经验，可以帮助组织更好地运作？	‘Cultural fit’ looks at a candidate’s ability to seamlessly integrate with the organization’s working style. This means asking: which one of the candidates in the final round brings in a unique set of experiences that will help the organization function better?
	
值得注意的是，招聘经理会询问应聘者的融入程度，他们最终将如何与团队融洽相处，并了解他们的个性如何与组织的需求相辅相成等等。除了考虑哪位候选人真正了解公司、对组织的使命感到兴奋并有目标之外，他们还将评估每位候选人如何适合日常工作。	Notably, hiring managers ask how well the candidates fit in, how they would eventually get along socially with the team, and look at how their personality can complement the organization’s needs and so on.  Beyond considering which candidate really understands the company, is excited about the organization’s mission and has goals, they will evaluate how each candidate would be suitable for day-to-day work.
	
**2\。软技能**	**2\. Soft skills**
	
人才招聘专业人员还会检查某些软技能是否在广告角色之外得到展示。例如，一位候选人是否在积极倾听、沟通、同理心、创造力和动力方面得分更高？一个候选人比另一个更有动力吗？一个比另一个更具前瞻性？如果被选中，哪些候选人可以在很少或没有监督的情况下开始工作？这些场景中的每一个都会影响最终的选择。	Talent acquisition professionals would also check if certain soft skills are demonstrated beyond the advertised role. For example does one candidate score more on active listening,  communication, empathy, creativity and drive? Is one candidate more motivated than the other? Is one more forward thinking than the other? Which of the candidates can hit the ground running if selected and start working with little or no supervision?  Each of these scenarios will influence the final selection.
	
如果可以证明额外的技能，比如了解一门额外的语言、软件程序或额外的证书，那总是一种奖励。甚至像哪位候选人在面试后及时发送感谢信这样的因素也可能是一个决定性因素。	If extra skills like knowing an additional language, a software program or an extra certification can be demonstrated, that can always be a bonus. Even a factor like which candidate promptly sent a thank you note after the interview can be a deciding factor.
	
**3\。未来潜力**	**3\. Future potential**
	
如果两位候选人都具备所需的技术技能，招聘经理将寻找对组织有益的其他专业领域。例如，哪位候选人在任何一个理想领域拥有更多专业知识，从长远来看这是否有用？	If both candidates possess the required technical skills, the hiring manager will look for additional areas of expertise that would benefit the organization. For instance, which candidate has more expertise in any one desired area and will that be useful in the long term?
	
当前的需求可能更加紧迫，但招聘经理也会着眼于未来。当谈到紧张的结局时，每个候选人随着时间的推移帮助组织发展的潜力将发挥重要作用。	The current need may feel more pressing, but the hiring manager will look to the future too. When it comes to a tight finish, each candidate’s potential to help grow the organization over time will play a big role.
	
特别是随着聊天 GPT 和人工智能的出现，公司将考虑能够帮助他们应对数字化转变的候选人。任何表现出更广泛的有用技术技能、对学习和发展感兴趣或具有良好领导潜力的人都将占据上风。	Especially with the advent of Chat GPT and artificial intelligence, companies will consider candidates who can help them navigate the digital shift. Anyone who displays a wider range of useful technical skills, an interest in learning and development or good leadership potential will definitely have the upper hand.
	
**4\。动力和热情**	**4\. Drive and enthusiasm**
	
最后，使候选人比其他候选人更受青睐的是个人的动力和热情。从第一次面试开始及之后，两位候选人的兴趣水平如何叠加？谁似乎对这份工作更有热情？谁问了更多的问题，什么样的问题？谁在整个过程中参与度更高？谁在上次采访后跟进以重申兴趣，在什么时间范围内？这些细节可能是决定性因素。	Finally, what tilts the scales in one candidate’s favour over other is the individual’s personal drive and enthusiasm. Between two candidates, how does the  interest level stack up, right from the first interview and beyond? Who seemed more enthusiastic for the job? Who asked more questions and what kind of questions? Who was more engaged throughout the process? Who followed up after the last interview to reiterate interest, and in what time frame? Details like these can be the deciding factor.
	
我相信以上提示可以提供帮助。在此祝愿您在成为“被选中的”人的道路上一切顺利！	I trust that the above tips can help. Here’s wishing you all the best on your quest to become the ‘chosen’ one!
