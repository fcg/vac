!以非加拿大人身份在加拿大买房	!Buying a home in Canada as a non-Canadian
	
做出移居另一个国家的决定绝非易事。有许多变量需要考虑，包括促进移民签证申请、安排适当的旅行证件、确保您有足够的钱来安顿和养活自己和/或家人，以及找到合适的地方安顿下来并扎根.	Making the decision to move to another country is never an easy task. There are many variables that need to be considered that range from facilitating immigration visa applications, arranging the proper travel documents, ensuring that you have enough money to settle and support yourself and/or family and finding the right place to settle down and plant your roots.
	
作为该国公民，在加拿大寻找和购买房屋已经是一件困难的事情。必须以非公民身份驾驭复杂的加拿大房地产市场是一项更加艰巨的任务。	Finding and buying a home in Canada is already a difficult affair as a citizen of the country. Having to navigate the complicated Canadian housing market as a non-citizen is an even harder task.
	
永久居留身份持有人处于一个独特的位置，他们有权享受与加拿大公民有权享受的相同的税收政府福利，但仍可免除其他优惠福利。	Permanent residence status holders are caught up in a unique position where they are entitled to the same tax-funded governmental benefits that Canadian citizens are entitled to but are still exempt from other preferential benefits.
	
这延伸到寻找合适的房产以在房地产市场内定居。新的永久居留权获得者一再遇到难以逾越的官僚主义和行政繁文缛节，这阻碍了他们在加拿大购买和拥有房屋的能力。	This extends to finding suitable property to settle down on within the housing market. Repeatedly new permanent residency recipients hit an insurmountable wall of bureaucracy and administrative red tape that hinders their ability to buy and own a house in Canada.
	
作为向我们的客户提供服务以减轻他们对这个问题的担忧的一种方式，我们编制了一份基本要求清单，以及您作为非加拿大人在加拿大购买房屋需要知道和做的事情。	As a means of providing a service to our customers with respect to easing their concerns around this issue, we have compiled a list of basic requirements and things you need to know and do in order to buy a home in Canada as a non-Canadian.
	
准备好开始您的旅程了吗？	Ready to Start Your Journey?
	
## 加拿大的住房	Housing in Canada
	
!在加拿大的住房	!housing in canada
	
PR 获得者在决定在加拿大买房时必须担心的最重要的考虑因素之一是他们需要多少空间/土地，这取决于他们移民到加拿大的人数。如果只有您长途跋涉来到加拿大，那么您可能只需要一间单间公寓或一居室公寓。	One of the foremost considerations PR recipients have to worry about when deciding to buy a house in Canada is how much space/land they need to have depending on the amount of people they have immigrated with to Canada. If it’s just you that has made the great permanent trek to Canada, then it is likely that all you will need is a studio or one-bedroom apartment.
	
当您永久移居加拿大后，明智地了解您的购买选择和选择非常重要。例如，在决定是否要买公寓或房子时考虑这两个问题：	When you have moved permanently to Canada, it’s important to be smart about your buying options and choices. For example, consider these two questions when deciding whether or not to take an apartment or house:
	
我是否应该为了有一个空房间而签租约租一套两居室的公寓？还是我应该在找到梦想的工作之前决定租一套更贵的公寓？	Should I sign a lease to rent a two-bedroom apartment just for the sake of having a spare room? Or should I decide to rent a more expensive apartment before I have landed my dream job?
	
即使您可能没有刻意将其纳入您的意图，但如果您要在找到一份好工作之前用现有的东西生存下去，那么尽可能存钱也是必要的。	Even if you may not intentionally factor it into your intentions, saving money wherever it is possible is necessary if you are going to survive with what you have until you get a good job.
	
如果您有幸获得工作机会，您仍然需要时间来习惯为几乎所有事情支付比您在本国所做的更多的费用。	Should you be fortunate enough to receive a job offer, you still are going to need time to get used to paying likely more for nearly everything than what you did back in your home country.
	
即使情况并非总是如此，被列为仅次于澳大利亚、瑞士和丹麦的世界上最好的第一世界国家之一，毫无疑问，你可能不得不将你的硬币翻转两次并沉迷于在加拿大成为房主的头几个月，您可以过上更节俭的生活方式。	Even if this isn’t always the case, being ranked one of the best first-world countries in the world next to Australia, Switzerland, and Denmark, there is no doubt that you may have to turn your pennies over twice and indulge in a bit of a more frugal lifestyle during your first few months as a homeowner in Canada.
	
当您开始寻找房屋以作为加拿大永久居民定居时，情况就是如此。如前所述，如果您是多人移民加拿大，考虑到您是与家人一起搬家，您将不得不考虑多人的生活费用。	This goes for when you start your search for a house to settle in as a Canadian permanent resident. As mentioned, if you are more than one person immigrating to Canada, you are going to have to consider the cost of living for more than one person, given that you are moving with your family.
	
一旦您确定了新房的大小、偏好和预算，您一定会在加拿大住房市场上找到一些价格合理的选择，以满足您的需求。	Once you have decided what the size, preferences, and budget of your new home should be, you will surely find some options with reasonable prices on the Canadian housing market to match what you are looking for.
	
当您在加拿大购买房屋时，与国外许多国家一样，您的“房东”是指定的加拿大银行，拥有您的房屋，有时甚至拥有您居住的全部财产。	When you purchase a house in Canada, in the same vein of many countries abroad, your “landlord” is the designated Canadian bank who owns your house or sometimes, the entire property that you live in.
	
在某些情况下，银行可以聘请财产和资产经理在您的付款出现拖欠的不幸情况下收取您的保证金，但通常他们会自行收取。	In some cases, banks can hire property and asset managers to collect your bond in the unfortunate circumstance of your payments going into arrears, but normally they collect it themselves.
	
每个加拿大省和地区都有不同的关于债券支付的法律和银行负责的标准，可以在这里查看。	Every Canadian province and territory has different laws regarding bond payments and criteria on what banks are responsible for, which can be reviewed here.
	
银行负责解释您居住的省份或地区的相关法律，并且必须向您提供加拿大房地产协会 (CREA) 等房地产主管部门的联系信息。	Banks are responsible for explaining relevant laws for the province or territory you live in and must provide you with the contact information of real estate authorities like the Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA).
	
您的银行还负责确保您选择购买的房产位于安全的环境中并且状况良好。	Your bank is also charged with ensuring the property you have selected for purchase is situated in a secure environment and is in good condition.
	
除非您以全价购买房屋，否则您应该按时全额支付押金。如果有任何必须解决的问题，请联系您的加拿大银行。	Unless you purchase your home at full price, you are expected to pay your bond in full on time. Contact your Canadian bank if there is anything that must be fixed.
	
如果有任何东西损坏并需要修理，您还必须联系您的房东，并在需要修理东西时允许房东经理进入您的家，或者如果您想搬家，必须向潜在租户展示公寓。	You must also contact your landlord if anything breaks and needs to be fixed and allow the landlord manager access to your home when something needs to be repaired or the apartment must be shown to potential tenants if you want to move.
	
## 作为非加拿大人购买房屋	Purchasing a Home as a non-Canadian
	
!在加拿大买房	!purchasing a home in canada
	
要在加拿大寻找住房选择，您可以寻求推荐、查看社区中心布告栏和报纸上的分类广告，以及查看在线分类广告。	To look for housing options in Canada, you can ask for referrals, check classified ads in community centers on bulletin boards and newspapers and check online classified ads.
	
您还可以访问房地产代理网站，向移民服务组织寻求帮助，寻找房地产/物业管理公司来帮助您找到理想的家，或者访问社区并在房屋或建筑物上搜索“出租”标志.	You can also visit real estate agency websites, ask for help from an immigrant-serving organization, find an estate/property management firm to help you find the ideal home, or visit neighborhoods and search for “for rent” signs on either houses or buildings.
	
在参观您可能购买的公寓或房屋之前，我们建议您列出您在考虑购买给定房产之前想问您的银行或房东的问题。	Before visiting an apartment or house that you could potentially purchase, we recommend making a list of questions that you would like to ask your bank or landlord before considering buying the given property.
	
在加拿大，您的银行或房地产经纪人可能会询问您有关您的个人/人口统计信息的问题，例如您在哪里工作、审查您的信用记录，并询问您有关您当前薪水的问题。	In Canada, your bank or realtor is likely to ask you questions regarding your personal/demographic information such as where you work, reviewing your credit history, and ask you questions regarding your current salary.
	
如果您尚未开始工作或没有工作，在加拿大没有推荐信或信用记录，您可以向移民服务组织寻求帮助。	If you are yet to start a job or don’t have one, don’t have references, or credit history in Canada, you can seek help from an immigrant-serving organization.
	
以下更详尽地列出了作为非加拿大人在加拿大购房的基本要求，您需要知道和做的一切。	The following presents a more thorough breakdown of everything you need to know and do regarding the basic requirements to buying a home in Canada as a non-Canadian.
	
### 寻找一个家	Looking for a Home
	
在开始您的购房之旅之前，您需要提前计划拥有房屋的成本。费用将包括：	Before starting your shop for a home journey, you’ll want to plan ahead for the costs of owning a home. Costs will include:
	
- 暖气	-   Heating
- 财产税	-   Property taxes
- 上门维修	-   Home repairs
- 加拿大抵押和住房公司 (CMHC) 提供简单的计算器和工作表供您使用。	-   Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) has simple calculators and worksheets you can use.

- 在您喜欢的社区周围行驶并寻找“待售”标志	-   Drive around a neighborhood that you like and look for “For Sale” signs
	
#### 房地产经纪人	Real estate agents
	
房地产经纪人可以帮助您寻找和购买房屋。他们将：	Real Estate agents can help you find and buy a home. They will:
	
- 倾听您的需求	-   Listen to your needs
- 安排家访	-   Arrange for home visits

- 访问加拿大房地产协会网站上的 Find a REALTOR® 搜索部分	-   Visit the Find a REALTOR® search section on the Canadian Real Estate Association website
	
找到你的途径	Find Your Pathway
	
### 出价	Making an Offer
	
找到房子后，就该提出“购买要约”了。如果您使用房地产经纪人，他们会帮助您出价。	Once you’ve found a home, it’s time to make an “offer to purchase.” If you’re using a real estate agent, they will help you make the offer.
	
如果您的购买要约被接受，您需要聘请律师或公证人将您的房屋过户到您的名下。您可以在网上找到一个或询问您的房地产经纪人。	If your offer of purchase is accepted, you’ll need to hire a lawyer or notary to transfer your home to your name. You can find one online or ask your real estate agent.
	
### 为你的家融资	Financing Your Home
	
许多购房者需要抵押贷款来购买他们的房子。您可以从以下机构获得抵押贷款：	A lot of homebuyers need a mortgage loan to purchase their home. You can get a mortgage loan from:
	
- 银行	-   Banks
- 其他金融机构，例如：信用合作社、大众储蓄银行、保险公司	-   Other financial institutions, like: credit unions, caisses populaire, insurance companies
	
您主要通过一段时间内的定期付款来偿还抵押贷款。这个期限通常长达 25 年。您将被收取借入这笔钱的利息。	You primarily pay back a mortgage through regular payments over a period of time. This period is usually up to 25 years. You will be charged interest to borrow this money.
	
在 CMHC 网站上阅读有关抵押贷款的更多信息。	Read more information on mortgages on the CMHC website.
	
### 首付和抵押贷款保险	Down Payment and Mortgage Loan Insurance
	
您的抵押贷款金额是房屋价格减去您的首付金额。如果首付款低于新房价格的 20%，您可能需要抵押贷款保险。	The amount of your mortgage is the price of the home minus the amount of your down payment. If the down payment is less than 20 percent of the price of your new home, you may need mortgage loan insurance.
	
如果您无法偿还抵押贷款，抵押贷款保险可以保护银行或金融机构。它还可以让您以较低的首付和较低的利率获得抵押贷款。	Mortgage loan insurance protects the bank or financial institution if you can’t pay back the mortgage. It also lets you get a mortgage for a lower down payment and a lower interest rate.
	
向您的银行或金融机构咨询抵押贷款保险。	Ask your bank or financial institution about mortgage loan insurance.
	
### 信用评分和历史记录	Credit Score and History
	
当您试图获得抵押贷款时，拥有良好的信用记录非常重要。作为加拿大的新移民，您可能没有加拿大银行认可的信用记录。	Having a good credit history is very important when you’re trying to get a mortgage. As a newcomer to Canada, you may not have a credit history that Canadian banks recognize.
	
要买房，您应该尽早开始获得新的信用记录。与您的银行家讨论制定开始信用记录的计划。	To buy a home, you should start getting a new credit history as early as possible. Speak with your banker about making a plan to start a credit history.
	
### 房屋检查	Home Inspection
	
要对房子出价，您应该以房屋必须通过专业验房为条件提出报价。如果检查员发现房屋存在严重问题，这可以让您取消或更改报价。	To make an offer on a house, you should make your offer with the condition that the home must pass a professional home inspection. This lets you cancel or change your offer if the inspector finds serious problems with the house.
	
要查找经认可的房屋检查员，请参阅：	To find an accredited home inspector, see:
	
- 聘请房屋检查员	-   Hiring a home inspector
- 加拿大房屋和财产检查员协会	-   Canadian Association of Home and Property Inspectors

## 其他形式的住房	Other Forms of Housing
	
!其他形式的住房	!other forms of housing
	
### 政府援助住房	Government-Assisted Housing
	
如果您的收入很低，难以负担购房费用，政府可以提供帮助。新移民或难民可以搬进补贴房，但您的名字将被列入等候名单。	Governments are in the position to help if you have low incomes that make it hard to afford the cost of a home. New immigrants or refugees can move into subsidized homes, but your name will be put on a waiting list.
	
在您到达加拿大之前，您不能将您的名字添加到等候名单中。抵达加拿大后，请向您所在城市或城镇的移民服务组织询问当地的补贴住房。	You cannot add your name to a waiting list before you arrive in Canada. Once you arrive in Canada, ask an immigrant-serving organization in your city or town about local subsidized housing.

合作公寓是一组公寓或房屋：	Co-op housing is a group of apartments or houses that:

大多数大学和学院都会为您提供有关校内和校外住宿的信息。请联系您计划就读的大学或学院的住房部门。	Most universities and colleges provide you with information about on-campus and off-campus housing. Contact the housing department of the university or college you plan to attend.
	
### 应急住房	Emergency housing
	
紧急住房也称为避难所，是为无家可归或处于危机中的人提供的短期住所。这是一个安全的地方，您可以获得基本必需品，例如：	Emergency housing which is also referred to as shelters is a short-term place for people who are homeless or in crisis. It’s a safe place where you can get basic necessities such as:
	
-   食物	-   Food
-   钱	-   Money
- 淋浴	-   Showers
	
如果您满足以下条件，紧急住房会有所帮助：	Emergency housing is helpful if you:
	
- 被赶出你的家	-   Get evicted from your home
- 没有地方睡觉	-   Are without a place to sleep
- 如果您呆在家里，有被虐待的风险	-   Are at risk of being abused if you stay in your home
	
对于国际移民，紧急住房最适合并主要用于安置难民和政治移民。	With regards to international migrants, emergency housing is best suited and mostly utilized to accommodate refugees and political migrants.
	
避难所的工作人员和志愿者协助：	Staff and volunteers at shelters assist with:
	
- 支持和信息	-   Support and information
-   法律咨询	-   Legal advice
-   经济帮助	-   Financial help
- 一个新的居住地	-   A new place to live
	
如果您没有时间打包，他们还提供：	If you did not have time to pack, they also provide:
	
-   食物	-   Food
-   衣服	-   Clothing
- 尿布	-   Diapers
-   玩具	-   Toys
	
如果您受到虐待和/或来自不利于您整体身心健康的社会背景，收容所工作人员不会告诉虐待您的人您在哪里。避难所的电话号码通常与其他紧急号码一起列在电话簿的前几页。	If you’re abused and/or come from a social background that is not conducive to your overall physical and mental well being , the shelter staff won’t tell the person who abused you where you are. Telephone numbers for shelters are usually listed in the first few pages of the telephone book with other emergency numbers.
	
您可以致电庇护所寻求建议，而无需提供您的姓名。一些工作人员会说不同的语言，或者可以得到口译员的帮助。	You can call a shelter for advice without having to provide your name. Some staff members speak different languages or can have an interpreter help.
	
### 老年人住房	Housing for Seniors
	
加拿大的老年人有辅助住房选择。其中包括政府资助的和私人的老年人住宅。	There are assisted housing options for seniors in Canada. These include government-funded and private residences for seniors.

加拿大房地产市场一直在升温。为了开始新生活而移居加拿大城市中心的移民人数不断增加，其住房债券市场正在经历前所未有的活动水平。	The Canadian housing market has been heating up. Bolstered by the perennially increasing numbers of immigrants that are moving to Canada’s urban centers in order to start a new life, its housing bond market is experiencing unprecedented levels of activity.
