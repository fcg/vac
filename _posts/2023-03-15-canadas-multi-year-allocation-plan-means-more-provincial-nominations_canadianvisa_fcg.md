2023 年 3 月 10 日，负责移民事务的部长论坛在新斯科舍省哈利法克斯的加拿大移民博物馆召开，以进一步就加拿大移民的命运展开对话。部长们共同努力推进解决加拿大范围内移民需求的举措，并对加拿大移民系统的进步感到高兴，以便更好地满足经济和区域需求。	On March 10, 2023, the Forum of Ministers Responsible for Immigration convened at the Canadian Museum of Immigration in Halifax, Nova Scotia to further their dialogue on the fate of immigration in Canada. The Ministers worked together to progress initiatives that address Canada-wide immigration needs and were pleased with the advancement of the Canadian immigration system in order to better serve economic and regional requirements.
	
## PNP 是加拿大移民的未来	PNPs as The Future of Immigration For Canada
	
省提名计划 (PNP) 是移民加拿大的一种途径，各省可以提名永久居留候选人。	The Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) is an avenue of immigration to Canada in which provinces can nominate candidates for permanent residence.
	
加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 是决定谁成为永久居民的最终决定因素。 IRCC 还确定一年内提供的省提名计划 (PNP) 提名的数量。	The Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) is the ultimate deciding factor on who is to become a permanent resident. IRCC also determines the number of Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) nominations to be given in a single year.
	
部长们回顾了在提升省/地区 (PT) 在选择经济移民和在省/地区提名计划 (PNP) 中分配更多名额方面的作用方面取得的进展。他们欢迎 IRCC 的多年分配计划，该计划规定 2023 年 PNP 拨款增长 44%，并包括 2024 年和 2025 年的名义拨款。	The Ministers reviewed progress on elevating the role of provincial/territorial (PT) in selecting economic immigrants and allocating more spots in the Provincial/Territorial Nominee Programs (PNPs). They welcomed IRCC's Multi-Year Allocation Plan, which provides for a 44% growth in PNP allocations for 2023 and includes notional allocations for 2024 and 2025.
	
> 移民、难民和公民部部长兼负责移民事务的部长论坛联邦联合主席肖恩弗雷泽阁下表示，“移民是最大限度地发挥加拿大经济潜力的关键，无论是解决短期劳动力短缺问题，还是为我们的社区吸引下一代所需的技能。我很重视与我的省和地区同事的关系，因为我知道这些伙伴关系对于加强和改善加拿大的移民制度以及促进我们的长期经济增长至关重要。”	> The Honourable Sean Fraser, Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship and federal co-chair of the Forum of Ministers responsible for Immigration stated, “Immigration is key to maximizing Canada’s economic potential, whether it is addressing labour shortages in the short term, or attracting the skills our communities will need for the next generation. I value the relationships with my provincial and territorial colleagues, knowing that these partnerships are crucial to strengthening and improving Canada’s immigration system, and contributing to our long-term economic growth.”
	
他们还重申，他们正在合作制定一个适应性强、以客户为导向的经济移民计划，各省在选择经济移民方面具有更大的影响力。该小组强调了联邦和省政府在创建加拿大移民体系中不可或缺和独特的角色和义务，以及拥有可变和兼容计划的重要性。	They also reiterated that they are collaborating to formulate an adaptive, customer-oriented economic immigration plan where provinces have greater influence in the selection of economic migrants. The group highlighted the federal and provincial governments' indispensable and unique roles and obligations in creating Canada's immigration system and the importance of having variable and compatible programs.
	
加拿大统计局的一项研究发现，通过省提名计划 (PNP) 进入加拿大的新移民往往比通过其他移民途径进入加拿大的新移民在劳动力市场上拥有更成功的经验。这是因为 PNP 中的人员已被确定为与特定省份的联系或在特定省份的劳动力市场中茁壮成长的能力。	A Statistics Canada study found that newcomers to Canada who enter through Provincial Nominee Programs (PNPs) tend to have a more successful experience in the labour market than those who come through other immigration pathways. This is due to the fact that those in PNPs have been identified for their connections to a specific province or for their aptitude to thrive in a particular province's labour market.
	
根据 2023-2025 年移民水平计划的概述，省提名计划 (PNP) 预计将带来最多的移民，总数为 105,500 人。	The Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) is projected to bring in the highest number of immigrants, with a total of 105,500, as outlined in the 2023-2025 Immigration Levels Plan.
	
## 改善经济移民程序	Improving The Economic Immigration Process
	
向省级部长介绍了快速通道经济移民平台的最新情况以及减少省提名计划申请中的繁文缛节的措施。该小组讨论了加快短期和永久途径的联邦移民处理的必要性。	Updates on the formulation of the Express Entry economic immigration platform and measures to lessen red tape in provincial nominee program applications were presented to provincial ministers. The group discussed the necessity of speeding up federal immigration processing for both short-term and permanent pathways.
	
联邦-省-地区移民部长会议侧重于确保移民系统在满足经济和地区需求方面的效率，并承认省级对当地就业市场要求的了解是一个应该利用的优势。	The Federal-Provincial-Territorial Immigration Ministers’ Table focused on ensuring the efficiency of the immigration system in meeting economic and regional needs and acknowledged that provincial knowledge of local job market requirements is an advantage that should be utilized.
	
他们讨论了如何在区域范围内推进有关移民目标和经济移民的政府间合作，包括省提名计划 (PNP) 和大西洋移民计划 (AIP) 等计划。	They discussed how they could move forward with intergovernmental collaboration on immigration objectives and economic immigration in a regional scale, including programs such as the Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) and Atlantic Immigration Program (AIP).
	
确定 PNP 是偏远地区移民和满足雇主劳动力市场需求的主要途径。部长们一致认为，移民的区域化意义重大，随着移民目标的增加，社区欢迎移民的能力应该被考虑在内。	It was determined that the PNP is the main approach for regional immigration and meeting the labour market needs of employers. Ministers agreed that regionalization of immigration is significant and, as immigration targets grow, the capacity of communities to welcome immigrants should be taken into account.
	
> 据负责移民事务的部长兼负责新不伦瑞克省机遇的部长以及负责移民事务的部长论坛的省-地区联合主席阿琳·邓恩阁下所说，“伙伴关系、协作和加强加拿大移民政策的共同愿景和计划是联邦、省和地区政府应对不断变化的移民形势的核心。通过今天的会议，我们希望建立势头，进一步明确我们各自政府在成功吸引、融合和留住移民方面的作用和责任。”	> According to The Honourable Arlene Dunn, Minister Responsible for Immigration and Minister Responsible for Opportunities New Brunswick and provincial-territorial co-chair of the Forum of Ministers responsible for Immigration, “Partnership, collaboration, and a shared vision for enhancing Canada’s immigration policies and programs are at the centre of how federal, provincial, and territorial governments navigate the ever-changing immigration landscape. Through today’s meeting we looked to build momentum to further clarify the roles and responsibilities of our respective governments to successfully attract, integrate, and retain immigrants.”
	
## 增加对定居点项目的访问	Increasing Access to Settlement Projects
	
在会议上，部长们重点讨论了定居服务的过去、现在和未来可能的模式，特别是改善成果和保留的方法，例如增加省和地区政府的参与和额外资金。	At the meeting, the ministers focused on past, present, and potential future models for settlement services, particularly ways to improve outcomes and retention, such as increasing participation from provincial and territorial governments and additional funding.
	
他们评估了联邦和省/地区政府目前在定居服务方面的职责，确定了成就、困难和可能性。	They evaluated the current responsibilities of the federal and provincial/territorial governments with regard to settlement services, identifying accomplishments, difficulties, and possibilities.
	
部长们一致认为，应向移民提供了解当地情况、提供便利和响应迅速的服务，以帮助他们融入并留在其登陆省份/地区。得出的结论是，应在随后的 FMRI 会议上进一步讨论服务提供模式以及联邦、省和地区政府的作用。	Ministers agreed that locally informed, accommodating, and responsive services should be provided to immigrants to help them integrate and remain in their province/territory of landing. It was concluded that service delivery models, as well as the roles of the federal, provincial, and territorial governments should be further discussed at the subsequent FMRI meeting.
	
部长们同意采取行动保持公众对移民的稳定支持，并合作确保 FPT 移民和定居的长期目标能够促进加拿大当前和未来的成功。弗雷泽部长欢迎他的同事们为最近启动的战略移民审查提供意见。	Ministers consented to take action to keep public backing for immigration steady and to collaborate to guarantee that the long-term FPT immigration and settlement objectives bolster Canada's current and future success. Minister Fraser welcomed his associates to give their input to the recently initiated Strategic Immigration Examination.
	
部长们进一步讨论了定居和融合工作、外国学历承认（FCR）以及加拿大对乌克兰局势的人道主义反应。他们提出未来有必要就那些打算留在加拿大或不能返回乌克兰的乌克兰人获得永久居留权的途径进行谈判。	The Ministers further discussed settlement and integration efforts, Foreign Credential Recognition (FCR), and Canada's humanitarian response to the situation in Ukraine. They raised the need to have future talks on pathways to Permanent Residency for those Ukrainians who intend to stay in Canada or cannot return to Ukraine.
	
> 根据 Fraser 的说法，“今天，我们就共同的优先事项进行了富有成效的讨论，例如通过加强省提名计划来分享移民的好处，减少外国证书承认的障碍，解决非正常移民问题，以及通过支持新移民来延续我们引以为豪的人道主义传统。阿富汗、乌克兰和世界各地的其他弱势群体。我期待着继续我们的对话，以便我们可以共同建立一个以客户为中心、响应我国社会和经济需求的移民系统。”	> According to Fraser, “Today, we had productive discussions on shared priorities such as sharing the benefits of immigration through enhancing the Provincial Nominee Program, reducing barriers to Foreign Credential Recognition, addressing irregular migration, and continuing our proud humanitarian tradition by supporting newcomers from Afghanistan, Ukraine, and other vulnerable populations around the world. I look forward to continuing our conversation so that together, we can build an immigration system that is client-centred, and responsive to our country’s social and economic needs.”
