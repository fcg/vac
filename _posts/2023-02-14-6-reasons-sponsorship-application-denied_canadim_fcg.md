一旦您获得加拿大永久居留权，明显的下一步就是担保您的配偶、受抚养子女和其他符合条件的家庭成员（如父母或祖父母）在加拿大永久居留。	Once you have obtained permanent residence in Canada, the obvious step ahead is to sponsor your spouse, dependent children and other eligible family members like parents or grandparents for permanent residence in Canada.
	
通过家庭赞助获得永久居留权是一个复杂而广泛的过程。必须了解流程并严格遵守规则，以确保您的文件不会被拒绝或拒绝。以下是您的赞助申请可能被拒绝的六个常见原因。	Permanent residence through family sponsorship is an elaborate and extensive process. It is essential to be knowledgeable about the process and to follow the rules closely to ensure that your file isn’t rejected or denied. Here are six common reasons why your sponsorship application could be denied.
	
1\。没有资格赞助	1\. Ineligible to Sponsor
	
重要的是要注意，仅仅成为加拿大永久居民或加拿大公民并不能使您有资格担保您的家庭成员。您必须满足成为担保人的最低要求。在完成赞助程序后，您应该是居住或打算居住在加拿大的成年人。	It is important to note that simply being a permanent residence of Canada or Canadian citizen does not make you eligible to sponsor your family member. You must fulfill the minimum requirements to become a sponsor. You should be an adult residing or intending to reside in Canada post completion of the sponsorship process.
	
如果您担保配偶/伴侣或受抚养子女以外的任何人，您还必须满足提出担保申请前三个纳税年度的最低收入要求。	If you are sponsoring anyone other than your spouse/partner or dependent children, you also have to meet minimum income requirements for the three taxation years preceding the sponsorship application.
	
**移民提示：** 如果您只是担保您的配偶、同居伴侣、夫妻伴侣或受抚养子女，则没有最低经济要求！	**Immigration Tip:** If you are only sponsoring your spouse, common-law partner, conjugal partner, or dependent children, there is no minimum financial requirement!
	
其他资格要求包括赞助商不应拖欠贷款、债券或家庭抚养费的偿还。担保人还必须没有犯罪记录，过去不应未能满足被担保家庭成员的基本需求，也不应接受社会援助。	Other eligibility requirements include that the sponsor should not have defaulted on repayment of loans, bonds, or family support payments. The sponsor must also have a clean criminal record, should not have failed to provide for basic needs of a sponsored family member in the past, and should not be receiving social assistance.
	
2\.没有资格获得赞助	2\. Ineligible to be Sponsored
	
被担保的家庭成员必须满足适用于所有永久居留申请人的基本资格要求。这是为了确保不符合条件的个人不会绕过强制性要求并通过家庭赞助获得加拿大永久居留权。	The family member being sponsored must fulfill the basic eligibility requirements applicable to all permanent residence applicants. This is to ensure ineligible individuals don’t bypass mandatory requirements and obtain permanent residence in Canada through family sponsorship.
	
只有某些类型的亲属有资格获得加拿大家庭担保。我们被问到的最常见问题之一是“我可以担保我的未婚夫（妻）吗？”简单回答是不。参与不足以获得家庭赞助的资格。但是，您可能与未婚夫（妻）符合同居伴侣或婚姻伴侣的定义。如果你不这样做，你将不得不等到正式结婚后再申请担保。	Only certain types of relatives are eligible for Canadian family sponsorship. One of the most frequent questions we are asked is “Can I sponsor my fiance(e)?” The simple answer is no. Engagement is not sufficient to be eligible for family sponsorship. However, you may meet the definition of common-law or conjugal partner with your fiance(e). If you don’t, you’ll have to wait to apply for sponsorship until after you are officially married.
	
存在安全风险、侵犯人权、没有无犯罪记录或有严重健康问题的人可能没有资格获得加拿大公民或永久居民的担保。此限制甚至适用于在其他方面有资格担保的个人，除非其家庭成员不符合担保资格要求。	One who is a security risk, guilty of human right violations, does not have a clean criminal record, or has significant health problems might not be eligible to be sponsored by a Canadian citizen or permanent resident. This restriction applies even to individuals who are otherwise eligible to sponsor except for the fact that their family member(s) don’t fulfill the eligibility requirements for sponsorship.
	
3\.居住在加拿大境外的永久居民	3\. Permanent Resident Living Outside Canada
	
当赞助商居住在加拿大境外时，不允许赞助。虽然加拿大公民即使居住在加拿大境外也可以启动担保程序，但永久居民的担保申请将因此被拒绝。公民的担保申请只有在他/她证明有意居住在加拿大且被担保的家庭成员获得永久居留权时才会被允许。	Sponsorship is not permitted when the sponsor is residing outside Canada. While Canadian citizens can initiate the sponsorship process even when residing outside Canada, a permanent resident’s application for sponsorship will be denied for this reason. The sponsorship application by the citizen will be allowed only if he/she proves intent to reside in Canada one the sponsored family member receives permanent residence.
	
4\。未申报的家庭成员	4\. Undeclared Family members
	
申请永久居留的个人必须在永久居留申请中申报其所有家庭成员。这包括申请人不打算担保的家庭成员。未能申报家庭成员将使他或她没有资格通过担保获得永久居留权，如果申请人将来想担保他们的话。除了担保申请被拒之外，这种遗漏也会影响担保人作为永久居民的身份。	An individual applying for permanent residence is required to declare all his or her family members in the permanent residence application. This includes family members that the applicant does not intend to sponsor. Failure to declare the family member will render him or her ineligible for permanent residence through sponsorship if the applicant wants to sponsor them in the future. Along with denial of the sponsorship application, this omission can impact the sponsor’s status as a permanent resident as well.
	
5\。申请表中的虚假陈述	5\. Misrepresentation in the Application Form
	
法律要求担保申请中涉及的所有各方——担保人和被担保的家庭成员——在申请中提供准确的信息。任何有意或无意的虚假陈述都将导致申请被拒绝。	All parties involved in the sponsorship application—sponsor as well as sponsored family members—are required by law to provide accurate information in the application. Any misrepresentation, accidental or deliberate, shall result in the application being denied.
	
由于该过程需要全面提交与个人详细信息、关系性质、财务状况、健康和体检、品行证明和其他详细信息相关的信息，您必须谨慎确保提交给移民局的信息真实、准确且有依据通过必要的书面证据，以尽量减少申请被拒绝的风险。	Since the process requires comprehensive submissions related to personal details, nature of relationship, financial condition, health and medical tests, character certificate and other details, you must take due care to ensure the information submitted to the immigration authorities is true, accurate, and backed by necessary documentary evidence to minimize risk of denial of the application.
	
6\。方便婚姻	6\. Marriage of Convenience
	
虽然永久居民和公民可以担保他们的外国配偶或伴侣，但此类申请将经过仔细审查，以防止出现婚姻欺诈的情况。申请表需要有关担保人与其配偶或伴侣关系的详细信息，包括关系开始的详细信息、结婚仪式的描述以及旨在评估关系真实性质的其他方面。	While permanent residents and citizens are permitted to sponsor their foreign spouse or partner, such an application will be carefully vetted to prevent instances of marriage fraud. The application form requires detailed information about the sponsor’s relationship with his or her spouse or partner including details of commencement of the relationship, description of the solemnization of marriage and other aspects designed to assess the true nature of the relationship.
	
与其他拒绝理由不同，以方便婚姻为由拒绝申请没有普遍和客观的标准。申请必须包括足够的证据证明这种关系确实是真实的，以满足移民官的疑虑和询问。一定要避免签证官在配偶担保申请中寻找的常见危险信号。	Unlike other grounds for denial, there is no universal and objective standard for rejection of application on grounds of marriage of convenience. The application must include sufficient evidence that the relationship is indeed genuine to satisfy the immigration officer’s doubts and queries. Be sure to avoid common red flags visa officers look for in spousal sponsorship applications.
	
聘请移民律师如何帮助您	How Hiring an Immigration Attorney Can Help You
	
分析资格要求以确定您是否有资格赞助或被赞助可能是一项复杂的任务。什么构成严重的健康问题或刑事定罪？即使是轻微的 DUI 犯罪也会使您不符合资格吗？您如何才能让移民官相信您与配偶或伴侣的关系是真诚的？您如何避免可能最终被视为虚假陈述的无意错误？	Analyzing the eligibility requirements to determine whether you are eligible to sponsor or be sponsored can be a complicated task. What constitutes a serious health problem or a criminal conviction? Does even a minor DUI offence render you ineligible? How can you impress upon the immigration officer that you have a genuine relationship with your spouse or partner? How can you avoid inadvertent mistakes that may end up being treated as misrepresentation?
	
担保您的配偶、受抚养子女或其他符合条件的亲属可以让您在加拿大的逗留更加愉快，让他们有机会在发达国家生活和繁荣，从而丰富他们的生活，并帮助加拿大获得受人尊敬的永久居民，寻求为国家做出贡献福利。向知名且经验丰富的律师寻求帮助是最简单、最安全的方法，可以最大程度地减少您的担保申请被拒绝或不必要的延误的可能性。	Sponsoring your spouse, dependent children, or other eligible relatives can make your stay in Canada more pleasant, enrich their lives by giving them a chance to live and prosper in a developed country, and help Canada gain respectable permanent residents seeking to contribute to the country’s welfare. Seeking assistance from a reputed and experienced lawyer is the simplest and safest way to minimize the chances of refusal or unnecessary delays of your sponsorship application.
