!如何在 2023 年从爱尔兰移民到加拿大	!How to Immigrate to Canada from Ireland in 2023
	
从爱尔兰乡村的绿色石山到加拿大多山苔原的白雪皑皑的山峰，从一个国家移民到另一个国家的过程对大多数申请人来说是一个非常艰难的过程。加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 实施的严格移民程序远远超过其他国家。	From the green stony hills of the Irish countryside to the snowy peaks of Canada’s mountainous tundra, the process of immigrating from one country to the other is a very difficult process for most applicants. The rigorous immigration procedure applied by the Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) far exceeds those of other countries.
	
雪上加霜的是，大多数申请人都面临着艰难的选择，他们有超过 100 个移民项目和类别可供选择。爱尔兰共和国的公民和居民也不能免于这一困难，因此为了消除移民过程复杂性的迷雾，下面概述了爱尔兰移民可以使用的一些最容易获得和导航的移民计划。	To add to this difficulty is the difficult choice presented to most applicants who have over 100 immigration programs and streams to choose from. Citizens and residents of the Republic of Ireland are not exempt from this difficulty, so with the aim of clearing the fog of complexity of the immigration process, below are outlined some of the most accessible and easily navigable immigration programs available to Irish immigrants.
	
如何在 2023 年从爱尔兰移民到加拿大	How to Immigrate to Canada From Ireland in 2023
		
关于参与移民加拿大的申请程序的第一个要点是确定申请人的申请资格。组织和促进资格测试以确定申请人是否符合资格标准的责任在于受监管的加拿大移民顾问 (RCIC) 或隶属于 RCIC 的移民咨询公司，例如 CanadianVisa。	The first point of call with regards to engaging in the application process to immigrate to Canada involves establishing the applicants eligibility to apply. The responsibility of organizing and facilitating the eligibility tests to see if the applicant meets the qualifying criteria rests on Regulated Canadian Immigration Consultants (RCIC’s) or immigration consultancy companies like CanadianVisa that are affiliated with RCIC’s.
	
CanadianVisa 将协助您在 IRCC 建立您的移民申请资料，并与 RCIC 代理联络，以确保您的申请符合现行标准，并且没有遗漏任何支持文件。	CanadianVisa will assist you in setting up your immigration application profile with the IRCC and liaising with an RCIC agent to make sure your application meets current standards and no supporting documentation is omitted.
	
我们将专注于国际经验类（IEC）（工作假期）、快速通道和省提名计划（PNP）。	We will focus on the International Experience Class (IEC) (Working Holiday), Express Entry and Provincial Nominee Program (PNPs).
	
###国际体验班（打工度假）	International Experience Class (Working Holiday)
	
加拿大的 IEC 或国际经验类计划让您有机会在加拿大工作期间旅行。年龄在 18 至 35 岁之间的爱尔兰公民在此计划下有 3 个选择，但是，只有两个可以导致永久居留权：	Canada’s IEC or International Experience Class program gives you a chance to travel while you work in Canada. Irish citizens, who are between the ages of 18 and 35 years old, have 3 options under this program, however, only two could lead to permanent residency:
	
* 打工度假（有效期长达 24 个月）- 允许您在旅行期间灵活选择工作地点和时间	  Working Holiday (valid for up to 24 months) - allows flexibility to choose where and when you want to work in between your travels
* 处理时间：赛季开始后约 8 周	  Processing Time: about 8 weeks once the season opens
* 签证费用：156 加元 所需额外资金：2,500 加元，以帮助您支付抵达加拿大时的部分费用	  Visa Costs: C$156 Additional Funds Required: C$2,500 to help you cover some of your expenses when you arrive in Canada
	
**Young Professionals**（有效期长达 24 个月）- 允许大专毕业生在加拿大获得工作经验	**Young Professionals** (valid for up to 24 months) - allows post-secondary graduates to get work experience in Canada
	
* 处理时间：赛季开始后约 8 周	  Processing Time: about 8 weeks once the season opens
* 签证费用：156 加元	  Visa Costs: C$156
* 所需额外资金：2,500 加元，以帮助您支付抵达加拿大时的部分费用	  Additional Funds Required: C$2,500 to help you cover some of your expenses when you arrive in Canada
* 附加要求：加拿大雇主签署的工作邀请或合同	  Additional Requirements: a signed job offer or contract from a Canadian employer
	
**国际合作或实习**（有效期长达 12 个月 - 允许大专学生在加拿大完成工作实习以完成他们的学术课程	**International Co-op or Internship** (valid for up to 12 months - allows post-secondary students to complete a work placement in Canada to fulfill their academic curriculum
	
* 处理时间：赛季开始后约 8 周	  Processing Time: about 8 weeks once the season opens
* 签证费用：156 加元	  Visa Costs: C$156
* 所需额外资金：2,500 加元，以帮助您支付抵达加拿大时的部分费用	  Additional Funds Required: C$2,500 to help you cover some of your expenses when you arrive in Canada
* 附加要求：加拿大雇主签署的工作邀请或合同	  Additional Requirements: a signed job offer or contract from a Canadian employer
	
**旅行要求**	**Travel Requirements**
	
一份入境口岸介绍信并已完全接种疫苗；或有有效工作机会的证明，并且可以在完成隔离后立即开始工作。确保在旅行前查看工作邀请上的开始日期。	A port of entry letter of introduction and be fully vaccinated; or have proof of a valid job offer and can start your job as soon as you complete your quarantine. Make sure you check the start date on your job offer before you travel.
	
如前所述，其中两个项目可能会导致永久居留权 (PR)。加拿大经验类（CEC）是一项移民计划，允许那些在过去三年内至少有一年工作经验的人申请永久居民身份。这可以是兼职或全职工作，只要总计 1,560 小时即可。	As mentioned earlier, two of these programs could lead to Permanent Residency (PR). The Canadian Experience Class (CEC) is an immigration program that allows those with at least one year of work experience within the last three years to apply for PR status. This can be either part-time or full-time work as long as it amounts to 1,560 hours in total.
	
但是，如果您在工作期间全日制学习，则不会计算您的经验。这意味着在 Co-op 或实习计划下获得的工作经验将不计入您的 PR 申请。	However, your experience will not be counted if you were studying full-time while working. This means that work experience gained under the Co-op or internship program will not count in your PR application.
	
**寻找提供移民前景的临时工作**	**Find Temporary Work That Offers Immigration Prospects**
	
如前所述，在加拿大工作可能是您获得加拿大永久居留权的途径。根据您的职业，您可以选择各种不同的工作计划。以下是申请爱尔兰工作签证时需要考虑的一些主要项目。	As mentioned previously, working in Canada can be your route to getting permanent residency in Canada. There are various different work programs that you could choose from depending on your occupation. Below are some of the top programs to consider when applying for a work visa from Ireland.
	
* 家庭支持工作者和家庭儿童保育提供者计划	  Home Support Worker & Home Childcare Provider programs
* 全球人才流	  Global Talent Stream
* 农业工人流	  Agriculture Worker Stream
	
### 快速通道系统	Express Entry System
	
快速入境系统可能是希望在 2023 年从爱尔兰移居加拿大的移民中最受欢迎的选择之一。根据您的工作经验和技能水平，有 3 个项目可供选择，您可以在短短 6 个时间内获得加拿大永久居留权到八个月。这些项目最吸引人的特点之一是它不会限制你可以搬到哪里。您也不一定需要工作机会才能获得资格。	The Express Entry System is probably one of the most popular choices amongst immigrants looking to move to Canada from Ireland in 2023. With 3 programs to choose from, depending on your work experience and skill level, you could get Canadian PR in as little as six to eight months. One of the most appealing characteristics of these programs is that it doesn’t restrict you in terms of where you can move to. You also don’t necessarily need a job offer to qualify.
	
从您的祖国搬家时，如果您选择一个与您的家乡有很多相似之处的目的地，那么过渡可能会容易得多。加拿大有许多美丽的地方可供选择，但可以说一些最美丽的城市位于加拿大的大西洋省份：	When moving from your home country, potentially for good, the transition can be a lot easier if you choose a destination that has a lot of similarities to your hometown. Canada has so many beautiful places to choose from, but arguably some of the most beautiful cities are located in Canada’s Atlantic provinces:
	
* 新不伦瑞克，	  New Brunswick,
*   新斯科舍省;	  Nova Scotia;
*纽芬兰和拉布拉多；和	  Newfoundland and Labrador; and
*   爱德华王子岛。	  Prince Edward Island.
	
这些省份不仅会让您想起家乡，而且还拥有一些最大的爱尔兰社区。例如，纽芬兰和拉布拉多 22% 的人口来自爱尔兰，并且具有很大的爱尔兰影响力。	Not only will these provinces remind you of home, but it also has some of the biggest Irish communities. For example, 22 percent of Newfoundland and Labrador’s population originate from Ireland and have a big Irish Influence.
	
如果崎岖的海岸线和郁郁葱葱的绿色乡村不能让您想起家，那么当地方言的口音肯定会让您想起家。新不伦瑞克省的首府圣约翰斯被认为是加拿大最爱尔兰化的城市，超过 31% 的人口来自爱尔兰。	If the rugged coastlines and lush green countryside don’t remind you of home, the accents of the local dialects certainly will. Saint John’s, New Brunswick’s capital, is considered to be Canada’s most Irish city with more than 31 percent of its population originating from Ireland.
	
事实上，这座城市是由爱尔兰定居者建造的，该省曾被称为“新爱尔兰”。爱德华王子岛近 30% 的人口由爱尔兰裔加拿大人组成，这将使在这个沿海社区定居变得轻而易举。	In fact, the city was built by Irish settlers and the province was once known as ‘New Ireland. Nearly 30 percent of Prince Edward Island’s population is made up of Irish-Canadians, which will make settling into this coastal community a breeze.
	
搬到大西洋加拿大的最佳方式是什么？ Atlantic Immigration Pilot 不仅成为永久性项目，而且处理时间与快速通道系统一样快！	And what's the best way to move to Atlantic Canada? The Atlantic Immigration Pilot has not only been made a permanent program but it has the same quick processing times as the Express Entry System does!
	
### 省提名项目	Provincial Nominee Programs
	
省提名计划 (PNP) 是加拿大各省提供的基于工作的移民计划，旨在解决他们的技能、工作经验和劳动力短缺需求。每个省份都有自己必须处理的一系列独特的劳工问题。	Provincial Nominee Programs (PNPs) are work-based immigration programs offered by Canadian provinces that want to address their skills, work experience and labor shortage needs. Each province has its own unique set of labor problems that they have to deal with.
	
这意味着每个省都会编制自己的需求工作清单，因此即使申请人针对特定省份的工作发出意向书 (EOI)，他们有资格申请的工作的工作签证可能未在该特定省份列出。	This means that each province compiles its own set list of jobs that are in-demand and so even if the applicant issues an Expression of Interest (EOI) for work in a particular province, the job for which they’re eligible to apply for a work visa for may not be listed in that particular province.
	
如果您不确定是否可以提交对特定 PNP 的兴趣表达，请先查看以下 PNP 和需求职业，以便做出明智的决定。	Should you not be sure if you can submit an expression of interest for a particular PNP, take a look at the following PNPs and in-demand occupations before so you can make an informed decision.

为什么从爱尔兰移居加拿大	Why Move to Canada From Ireland
		
从爱尔兰移居加拿大的好处主要在于爱尔兰和加拿大之间的社会文化联系。爱尔兰人是最早移民到加拿大的欧洲社区之一。这种移民在 19 世纪中叶到 20 世纪初分两波达到顶峰。由于这种早期移民，加拿大有一个庞大的爱尔兰人社区，尤其是在大西洋沿岸省份。	The benefits of moving to Canada from Ireland mostly revolve around the socio-cultural ties between Ireland and Canada. Irish people were one of the earliest European communities to immigrate to Canada. This immigration peaked in two waves during the mid 19th century to the turn of the 20th century. As a result of this early immigration there is a huge community of Irish people in Canada, especially along the Atlantic provinces.
	
这个庞大的社区自然而然地创造了一种非常独特的爱尔兰文化，尽管受到现代美国西部的影响，但保留了从爱尔兰岛继承下来的传统和习俗。庆祝爱尔兰文化的节日很多，甚至在加拿大城市也有一些社区尊重爱尔兰文化、食物、服装、音乐等。简而言之，对于许多爱尔兰裔加拿大人来说，加拿大只是另一个家外之家。	This large community has naturally created a very distinctive Irish culture that although is peppered with modern western American influence has retained traditions and practices inherited from the isle of Ireland. Festivals that celebrate Irish culture are plentiful and even in urban Canada there are pockets of communities that honor Irish culture, food, clothing, music etc. In brief, for a lot of Irish Canadians, Canada is just another home away from home.
	
我们如何帮助您从爱尔兰移居加拿大？	How can we Help you Move to Canada From Ireland?
		
申请过程中最重要的因素之一是确保您满足所有要求。申请者最常犯的错误之一是假设满足某些要求将使您获得成功。然而，加拿大政府对截止日期和标准极为严格，如果您不满足这些要求，您将面临签证被拒绝或延迟的风险。	One of the most important factors in the application process is to ensure that you meet all of the requirements. One of the most common mistakes made amongst applicants is assuming that meeting some of the requirements will allow you to be successful. The Canadian government, however, is extremely strict about deadlines and criteria and if you don’t meet them you run the risk of having your visa rejected or delayed.
	
尽管某些程序允许您多次申请，但第一次就正确完成申请流程很重要。这就是使用像 CanadianVisa 这样的 RCIC 附属移民咨询公司会派上用场的地方。您不仅可以节省时间，还可以节省金钱，因为如果您在申请时犯了错误，您可能不得不从头开始，这意味着需要支付第二次签证申请费。	Although some programs will allow you to apply more than once, it’s important to get the application process right the first time around. This is where using an RCIC affiliated immigration consultancy company like CanadianVisa will come in handy. Not only will you save time but money too because if you make a mistake on your application you may have to start from scratch, which means paying a second visa application fee.
	
CanadianVisa 将帮助您避免这些陷阱，并代表您促进申请流程的每一步，从安排资格测试到提交申请	CanadianVisa will assist you to avoid these pitfalls along with facilitating every step of the application process on your behalf from arranging the eligibility test to submitting the application
