### 2022 年 5 月 1 日：拒绝处理列表已删除	May 1, 2022: Refusal to process list removed

自 2022 年 5 月 1 日起，艾伯塔省政府取消了对雇用新的临时外籍工人的限制，以帮助雇主满足其劳动力需求。阿尔伯塔省政府删除了“拒绝处理”名单上的所有职业，该名单是为了优先考虑因大流行而失业的阿尔伯塔人的工作。	As of May 1, 2022, the Alberta government lifted restrictions on hiring new temporary foreign workers to help employers meet their workforce needs. The Alberta government removed all occupations on the ‘refusal to process’ list, which had been created to prioritize jobs for unemployed Albertans due to the pandemic.

这支持了艾伯塔省经济中正在经历劳动力短缺和努力用加拿大工人填补空缺职位的部门。	This supports sectors of Alberta’s economy that are experiencing labour shortages and struggling to fill available positions with Canadian workers.

这一变化可能会增加在艾伯塔省快速通道类别下选择和收到意向通知函的可能性。艾伯塔省机会流资格没有变化。自 2020 年 10 月 31 日起，拒绝处理名单不适用于艾伯塔省机会流资格标准。	This change may increase the likelihood for selection and receipt of a Notification of Interest letter under the Alberta Express Entry Stream. There is no change to Alberta Opportunity Stream eligibility. The refusal to process list has not applied to Alberta Opportunity Stream eligibility criteria since October 31, 2020.
