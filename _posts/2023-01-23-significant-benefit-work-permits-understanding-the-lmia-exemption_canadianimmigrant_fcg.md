2022 年 12 月 15 日，加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 更新了其劳动力市场影响评估 (LMIA) 豁免代码。 LMIA 是加拿大服务部的意见，即外国工人的入境将对加拿大劳动力市场产生积极或中立的影响。要获得积极的 LMIA，雇主通常必须在规定的网站上招聘四个星期，邀请可能合格的加拿大人申请，支付现行工资，并展示其他劳动力市场福利。这个过程往往很艰难。	On December 15, 2022, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) updated its Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) exemption codes. An LMIA is an opinion from Service Canada that the entry of a foreign worker will have a positive or neutral impact on the Canadian labour market. To obtain a positive LMIA, employers must generally recruit for four weeks on prescribed websites, invite potentially qualified Canadians to apply, pay prevailing wage, and demonstrate other labour market benefits. The process is often difficult.
	
由于这个和其他原因，加拿大移民立法允许 IRCC 在某些情况下签发工作许可证，而雇主无需获得 LMIA。这些被称为 LMIA 豁免。	Because of this, and other reasons, Canadian immigration legislation allows IRCC to issue work permits in certain circumstances without employers needing to obtain LMIAs. These are known as LMIA exemptions.
	
在大多数情况下，2022 年 12 月 15 日的变更涉及重新编号一些 LMIA 豁免并将之前的豁免分为几类。预计未来会发生变化。然而，对商业计划和其他企业家的省提名人的 LMIA 豁免有重要变化。这些变化涉及引入“显着效益”测试。	For the most part, the December 15, 2022, changes involve renumbering some of the LMIA exemptions and splitting previous exemptions into several categories. Future changes are expected. There were, however, important changes to the LMIA exemptions for provincial nominees in business programs and other entrepreneurs. These changes involve the introduction of “significant benefit” tests.
	
**重大利益豁免**	**Significant Benefit exemption**
	
对于在加拿大工作会产生重大经济、社会或文化利益的个人，IRCC 一直给予 LMIA 豁免。	IRCC has always had an LMIA exemption for individuals whose work in Canada would generate significant economic, social or cultural benefits.
	
一般来说，经济利益是指有助于公司增长、扩张或延续的利益，具有财政利益，并允许加拿大商业界的竞争优势。社会效益是指某人的工作将为未直接参与商业交易的其他第三方提供显着的外部效益。文化被定义为创造性的艺术活动以及由此产生的商品和服务。	Generally, economic benefits are benefits that would contribute to a company’s growth, expansion or continuation that have fiscal benefits and allow for the competitive advantage of Canada’s business community. Social benefits are where someone’s work will provide significant external benefits to other third parties not directly involved in business transactions. Culture is defined as creative artistic activities and the goods and services produced by it.
	
重要包括但不限于评估外国国民的工作将如何为加拿大提供一般经济支持、加拿大工业的进步、健康和福祉的增加或容忍度的增加或与其他类似人士聚在一起的机会文化。	Significant includes, but is not limited to, an assessment of how the work of a foreign national will provide general economic support for Canada, advancement of Canadian industry, increased health and well-being or increased tolerance or opportunities to come together with others of similar culture.
	
IRCC 网站提供了上述所有内容的示例。它警告说，签证官应该不愿意签发该类别的工作许可证，但也指出，如果没有 LMIA，并且实际考虑的平衡表明外国国民的工作将在经济上对加拿大有重大好处， 、社会或文化方面，则可以在没有 LMIA 的情况下签发工作许可证。	The IRCC website provides examples of all of the above. It cautions that visa officers should be reluctant to issue work permits under the category, but also notes that where an LMIA is not available, and the balance of practical considerations indicates that the work of a foreign national would be of significant benefit to Canada, economically, socially, or culturally, then a work permit can be issued without the LMIA.
	
**省级企业家提名计划**	**Provincial Nominee Program for entrepreneurs**
	
在 2022 年 12 月 15 日之前，获得省政府颁发的工作许可支持函的潜在省提名人在该省成为企业家时，无需证明他们在加拿大的工作会产生重大的经济、社会或文化效益。	Prior to December 15, 2022, prospective provincial nominees who were issued work permit support letters by a provincial government to be entrepreneurs in a province did not need to also demonstrate that their work in Canada would generate a significant economic, social or cultural benefit.
	
省级支持信可能具有指示性，但 IRCC 现在似乎基本上是在重新评估省级提名申请。这已不再是这种情况。现在，根据新的 LMIA 豁免代码 C-60，根据省提名计划申请工作许可的企业家通常需要证明他们拟议的工作将提供一般经济刺激或加拿大工业的进步。他们还需要提供商业计划书，证明他们有管理企业的经验、经营企业所需的语言能力以及他们的工作将带来重大利益。	This is no longer the case. Now, under a new LMIA Exemption Code C-60, entrepreneurs applying for work permits under provincial nominee programs will generally need to demonstrate that their proposed work will provide general economic stimulus or the advancement of Canadian industry. They will also need to provide business plans which show that they have the experience to manage the business, the language abilities needed to operate the business and that their work will be of significant benefit. Provincial letters of support may be indicative, but IRCC will now it seems essentially be reassessing provincial nomination applications.
	
这一变化的后果是重大的，可能会降低省提名企业家计划的吸引力和可预测性。这一变化是最近发生的，尚未被广泛宣传。那些考虑申请省级企业家计划的人，以及可能代表他们的人，需要了解新的 LMIA 豁免代码 C-60。	The consequence of this change is significant and could potentially reduce the attractiveness and predictability of provincial nominee entrepreneur programs. The change is recent and has not been widely publicized. Those considering applying to provincial entrepreneur programs, as well as those who may represent them, need to understand the new LMIA Exemption Code C-60.
