!3 从印度赞助您的配偶的步骤	!3 Steps to Sponsor Your Spouse from India
	
如果您打算从印度担保您的配偶，您需要遵循三个基本步骤。您可以先检查您的资格，收集必要的文件，最后申请赞助。本文将详细指导您完成这些步骤，包括通过家庭类签证申请配偶担保所需的文件和申请流程时间表。	If you are planning to sponsor your spouse from India, there are three essential steps you need to follow. You can get started by by checking your eligibility, gathering the necessary documents and finally, applying for the sponsorship. This article will guide you through these steps in detail, including the required documents and the application process timeline for the Spousal Sponsorship through the Family Class visa.   
	
### 第 1 步：检查您的资格	Step 1: Check Your Eligibility
	
如果您打算从印度担保您的配偶或伴侣，您必须满足某些资格要求。首先，您必须年满 18 岁并且是加拿大公民或居住在加拿大的永久居民。	If you are planning to sponsor your spouse or partner from India, there are certain eligibility requirements that you must meet. Firstly, you must be at least 18 years old and either a Canadian citizen, or a permanent resident living in Canada.
	
如果您是居住在加拿大境外的加拿大公民，您必须证明您计划在您的受担保配偶成为永久居民时居住在加拿大。但是，如果您是加拿大境外的永久居民，则不能担保某人。	If you are a Canadian citizen living outside Canada, you must show that you plan to live in Canada when your sponsored spouse becomes a permanent resident. However, if you are a permanent resident outside of Canada, you cannot sponsor someone.
	
此外，您必须能够证明您没有因为残疾以外的原因而接受社会援助。您还必须证明您可以满足您的基本需求、您的配偶或伴侣的基本需求、您配偶或伴侣的受抚养子女（如果适用）以及您的受抚养子女（如果您仅资助您的受抚养子女）。	Additionally, you must be able to prove that you are not receiving social assistance for reasons other than a disability. You must also demonstrate that you can provide for your basic needs, your spouse or partner's basic needs, your spouse or partner's dependent child(ren) if applicable, and your dependent child(ren) if you are sponsoring only your dependent child.
	
请务必注意，您和您的配偶或伴侣还必须满足其他要求，例如通过体检和犯罪检查、提供准确信息以及证明真实关系。	It is important to note that there are other requirements that you and your spouse or partner must meet, such as passing medical and criminal checks, providing accurate information, and demonstrating a genuine relationship.
	
如果您是加拿大公民或永久居民，您可以担保您的配偶、同居伴侣或婚姻伴侣成为加拿大永久居民。	If you are a Canadian citizen or permanent resident, you may sponsor your spouse, common-law partner, or conjugal partner to become a permanent resident of Canada.
	
**家庭类中的配偶或同居伴侣：**	**Spouse or Common-Law Partner in Family Class:**
	
- 如果您担保您的配偶，您的婚姻必须是合法有效的公证婚姻。	-   Your marriage must be a legally valid civil marriage if you are sponsoring your spouse.
- 如果您担保您的同居伴侣，您必须以类似婚姻的关系与您的同居伴侣共同生活至少连续 12 个月。	-   You must have been living with your common-law partner for at least 12 consecutive months in a marriage-like relationship if you are sponsoring your common-law partner.
- 如果夫妻双方符合特定标准，包括与担保人处于相互依赖的关系至少一年，并且由于无法控制的原因无法与担保人同住，则他们也有资格获得担保。	-   A conjugal partner is also eligible for sponsorship if they meet specific criteria, including being in a mutually interdependent relationship with the sponsor for at least one year and unable to live with the sponsor due to reasons beyond their control.
	
### 第 2 步：收集您的文件	Step 2: Gather Your Documents
	
从印度担保您的配偶的第二步是收集所有必要的文件。将清单上列出的所有要求的表格和文件包括在内至关重要，因为缺少文件可能会导致申请未经处理而被退回。	The second step in sponsoring your spouse from India is gathering all the necessary documents. It is crucial to include all the requested forms and documents listed on the checklist, as a missing document may result in the application being returned without processing.
	
清单包含适用于您情况的特定项目，您应该只提交相关文件。同样重要的是要注意，任何非英语或法语的文件都必须附有原始文件的认证副本、英语或法语翻译以及完成翻译的人的宣誓书。	The checklist contains specific items that apply to your situation, and you should only submit relevant documents. It is also important to note that any documents not in English or French must be accompanied by a certified copy of the original document, an English or French translation, and an affidavit from the person who completed the translation.
	
此外，必须翻译非英语或法语的通信证明文件，例如信件、打印的短信、电子邮件或社交媒体对话。	Additionally, proof of communication documents not already in English or French, such as letters, printed text messages, emails, or social media conversations, must be translated.
	
要担保您的配偶从印度到加拿大，您需要提供以下具体文件：	To sponsor your spouse from India to Canada, you will need to provide the following specific documents:
	
- 证明您的加拿大公民身份或永久居留权	-   Proof of your Canadian citizenship, or permanent residency
- 您与配偶关系的证明（如结婚证、联名银行账户对账单、照片等）	-   Proof of your relationship with your spouse (such as marriage certificate, joint bank account statements, photographs, etc.)
- 您或您的配偶自 18 岁起居住超过六个月的所有国家/地区的警方证明和/或清关证明	-   Police certificates and/or clearance certificates from all countries where you or your spouse have lived for more than six months since the age of 18
- 体检	-   Medical exams
- 财务支持和提供基本需求能力的证明，例如所得税申报表、雇佣信、银行对账单等。	-   Proof of financial support and ability to provide basic needs, such as income tax returns, employment letters, bank statements, etc.
- 表格和费用，如申请包中所述。	-   Forms and fees, as outlined in the application package.
	
请务必注意，所需的具体文件可能因您的情况而异。您应该参考申请包和清单以获取详细说明。	It is important to note that the specific documents required may vary depending on your circumstances. You should refer to the application package and checklist for detailed instructions.
	
### 第三步：申请	Step 3: Apply
	
要申请配偶担保，您必须在您将提交的清单上指定“申请类别”。如果您担保居住在加拿大境外的配偶或同居伴侣，您必须在家庭担保类别下申请。	To apply for spousal sponsorship, you must specify the "Class of Application" on the checklist you will submit. If you are sponsoring a spouse or common-law partner living outside Canada, you must apply under the Family Sponsorship Class.
	
自 2022 年 9 月 23 日起，申请流程是在线的，但 IRCC 可以为因残疾而无法在线申请的人提供便利。加拿大政府的目标是在 12 个月内决定配偶担保申请；但是，居住在加拿大境外的配偶或同居伴侣的处理时间目前为 16 个月。	As of September 23, 2022, the application process is online, but IRCC can make accommodations for those who cannot apply online due to disabilities. The Canadian government aims to decide on spousal sponsorship applications within 12 months; however, the processing time for spouses or common-law partners living outside Canada is currently 16 months.

提供准确和完整的信息非常重要，包括被担保人居住过的国家/地区列表，因为这将为所需文件提供具体说明。	It is important to provide accurate and complete information, including a list of countries where the sponsored person has lived, as this will provide specific instructions for the required documents.
	
您必须准确、诚实地填写和提交各种表格。这些与您的个人资料、您的配偶和您的关系有关。正确填写这些文件对于成功申请至关重要。	There are various forms that you must be filled out and submit accurately and honestly. These pertain to your particulars, your spouse’s and your relationship. It is vital for a successful application that these documents be filled out correctly.
	
为了安心并增加您的配偶在加拿大与您团聚的机会，请联系受监管的加拿大移民顾问 (RCIC) 为您提供帮助。	To have peace of mind and increase your chances of having your spouse join you in Canada, contact a Regulated Canadian Immigration Consultant (RCIC) to assist you.

## 您作为担保人的义务	Your Obligations As a Sponsor
	
!您作为赞助商的义务	!Your Obligations As a Sponsor
	
作为赞助商，在签署承诺协议之前了解您的义务很重要。通过签署承诺书，您承诺为您担保的配偶或伴侣及其受抚养子女的基本需求提供经济支持。基本需求包括食物、衣服、住所和其他日常生活费用，以及公共卫生服务未涵盖的健康需求，例如牙科和眼部护理。	As a sponsor, it is important to understand your obligations before signing the undertaking agreement. By signing the undertaking, you promise to provide financial support for the basic needs of your sponsored spouse or partner and their dependent children. Basic needs include food, clothing, shelter, and other everyday living expenses, as well as health needs not covered by public health services, such as dental and eye care.  
	
在签署协议之前，确保您担保的人不需要依赖政府的社会援助是至关重要的。如果他们确实获得了社会援助，您将需要在您对他们负有法律责任时偿还他们获得的金额。这也意味着在您还清所欠金额之前，您不能赞助任何其他人。	Before signing the agreement, it is crucial to ensure that the people you are sponsoring will not need to rely on social assistance from the government. If they do receive social assistance, you will be required to repay the amount they received when you are legally responsible for them. This also means that you cannot sponsor anyone else until you have repaid the amount owed.
	
重要的是要注意，该承诺是具有约束力的支持承诺。这意味着即使您的情况发生变化，您也有责任在整个承诺期间为申请人提供支持。即使您担保的人成为加拿大公民，您离婚或分居，或者您与被担保人的关系破裂，您或您担保的人搬到另一个地方，承诺将在承诺期限内保持有效省或国家，或者您有财务问题。	It is important to note that the undertaking is a binding promise of support. This means it is your responsibility to support the applicant(s) for the entire undertaking period, even if your situation changes. The undertaking will remain in effect for the length of the undertaking period, even if the person you sponsor becomes a Canadian citizen, you become divorced or separated, or your relationship with the sponsored person breaks down, you or the person you sponsor move to another province or country, or you have financial problems.
	
在同意成为担保人之前，认真对待您的义务并确保您能够提供必要的支持至关重要。如有任何疑问或疑虑，应在签署承诺协议前寻求专业意见。	It is crucial to take your obligations seriously and ensure that you can provide the necessary support before agreeing to become a sponsor. If you have any doubts or concerns, you should seek professional advice before signing the undertaking agreement.
	
## 配偶签证的好处	Benefits of A Spousal Visa
	
获得加拿大配偶签证有几个好处：	There are several benefits of obtaining a spousal visa for Canada:
	
- 您的配偶可以在加拿大工作：凭借配偶签证，您的配偶可以获得开放式工作许可，允许他们在没有工作机会的情况下为任何加拿大雇主工作。这使他们能够为家庭财务做出贡献并获得加拿大工作经验。	-   Your spouse can work in Canada: With a spousal visa, your spouse can obtain an open work permit, allowing them to work for any Canadian employer without a job offer. This allows them to contribute to household finances and gain Canadian work experience.
- 您的配偶可以在加拿大学习：配偶签证还允许您的配偶在加拿大学习而无需单独的学习许可。这为专业发展和职业发展提供了机会。	-   Your spouse can study in Canada: A spousal visa also allows your spouse to study in Canada without needing a separate study permit. This provides opportunities for professional development and career advancement.
- 家庭团聚：配偶签证允许您与配偶团聚，创造稳定的家庭环境，让您在加拿大共同生活。	-   Family reunification: A spousal visa allows you to be reunited with your spouse, creating a stable family environment and allowing you to build a life together in Canada.
	
这些好处有助于家庭团聚，并为个人和职业发展提供更多机会。	These benefits contribute to family reunification and allow for greater opportunities for personal and professional growth.
	
## 赞助您的受抚养子女	Sponsoring Your Dependant Children
	
!赞助您的受抚养子女	!Sponsoring Your Dependant Children
	
资助受抚养子女是加拿大家庭团聚的一个重要方面。如果您是加拿大公民或永久居民，您可能有资格赞助您的受抚养子女来加拿大与您同住。受抚养子女通常被定义为 22 岁以下且未婚的儿童。但是，此规则也有一些例外情况，例如残疾儿童或 22 岁以上但在经济上仍依赖父母的儿童。	Sponsoring dependant children is an important aspect of family reunification in Canada. If you are a Canadian citizen or a permanent resident, you may be eligible to sponsor your dependant children to come and live with you in Canada. Dependant children are typically defined as those who are under the age of 22 and unmarried. However, there are some exceptions to this rule, such as children with a disability or those who are over the age of 22 but still financially dependent on their parents.
	
要资助您的受抚养子女，您需要满足某些资格要求并提供您与他们的关系证明。您还需要证明您可以在他们抵达加拿大后为他们提供经济支持。这意味着您将需要满足特定的收入要求，并在特定时间段内为您的孩子提供经济支持。	To sponsor your dependant children, you will need to meet certain eligibility requirements and provide proof of your relationship with them. You will also need to show that you can financially support them once they arrive in Canada. This means that you will need to meet certain income requirements and provide financial support for your children for a specified period of time.
