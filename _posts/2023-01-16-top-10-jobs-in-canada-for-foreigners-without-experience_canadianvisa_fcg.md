为什么加拿大需要没有经验的工人？	Why Does Canada Need Workers Without Experience?  
	
过去几年，加拿大一直饱受劳动力短缺之苦。老龄化、停滞不前的人口和过度受教育的年轻人使问题更加复杂，以至于该国年复一年地出现长期劳动力短缺。这种短缺在体力劳动工作部门尤为明显。	Canada has been suffering from a labor shortage in the past couple of years. The aging, stagnant population and overly educated youth has compounded the problem to such a degree that year on year the country has had chronic labor shortages. This shortage is especially evident in the menial labor job sector.
	
由此带来的机会是，缺乏经验/没有经验的工人现在有机会填补那些对运转良好的社会至关重要但经常被忽视的职位。	The opportunity presented by this is that workers with inexperience/ no experience now have the opportunity to fill in those job posts that are vitally important to a well-functioning society but often neglected.

移民加拿大的过程充满了挑战和官僚陷阱，这可能是许多潜在移民想要移居加拿大的主要障碍。对于没有任何工作经验或当今大多数高移民目的地国家所重视的任何受追捧的专业知识的工人来说，这一事实更为真实。	The process of immigrating to Canada is a process that is fraught with challenges and bureaucratic pitfalls that can be a major disincentive to a lot of potential immigrants from wanting to move to Canada. This fact rings truer for workers who don’t have any work experience or any of the sought after specialized expertise valued by most high immigrant destination countries today.
	
为了避免您因必须自己完成此过程而产生的所有焦虑和麻烦，我们建议您咨询 RCIC 附属的私人移民公司，例如 CanadianVisa，以帮助您简化申请过程。	To spare you all of the anxiety and hassle of having to go through this process on your own, we recommend consulting with an RCIC affiliated private immigration company like CanadianVisa to help facilitate the application process for you.
	
我们提供资格评估、申请支持文件，并通过让申请人与 RCIC 联系来协助申请人申请，RCIC 将指导申请从提交到成功。	We offer eligibility evaluations, requisition supporting documents and assist applicants to apply by getting them in touch with an RCIC who will steer the application from the point of submission to its success.
	
如果您的申请成功，您将需要申请工作签证，该签证使您有资格在三个主要项目中工作，即临时外国工人项目 (TFWP)、联邦技术工人项目 (FSWP) 和联邦技术贸易项目。	Should your application be successful you will need to apply for a work visa, which qualifies you to work within three main programs available are Temporary Foreign Workers Program (TFWP), Federal Skilled Worker Programs (FSWP) and Federal Skilled Trades Programs.
	
一旦您在这些工作中的任何一项中获得了足够的经验或技能，您就可以申请永久居民身份，这使您有资格获得某些加拿大政府福利，并且不再需要工作签证。	Once you have gained enough experience plying your trade or skill in any one of these jobs, you may then apply for permanent resident residency status, which makes you eligible for certain Canadian government benefits and no longer require a work visa.

常见问题	FAQs
	
### 我如何在没有经验的情况下移居加拿大？	How Can I Move to Canada With No Experience?
	
在没有工作经验的情况下，您可以通过多种方式移居加拿大。如果你的综合排名系统（CRS）分数足够高，没有工作经验，特别是如果你有工作机会，你可以通过快速通道系统申请。您还可以联系您希望定居的省份和地区，了解他们需要什么样的劳动力。可以申请省提名，增加无工作经验移民加拿大的机会。	There are various ways you can move to Canada with no work experience. If your Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) scores are high enough without work experience, especially if you have a work offer, you can apply through the Express Entry System. You can also reach out to provinces and territories you wish to settle in and find out what kind of labor they require. You can apply for a provincial nomination and increase your chances of immigrating to Canada with no work experience.
	
### 没有工作经验怎么找工作？	How Do I Find a Job Without Work Experience?
	
找工作可能会有压力。幸运的是，Jobbank、LinkedIn 和 Indeed 等优秀网站可以为您提供帮助。他们拥有先进的搜索引擎，可以在互联网上搜索招聘信息。只需在加拿大搜索栏中的职位中输入“无经验”，然后按地点、发布日期、与您的简历的相关性等进行筛选。	Job hunting can be stressful. Luckily, there are great websites like Jobbank, LinkedIn and Indeed among others that can help you out. They have sophisticated search engines that scour the internet for job posts. Simply type in ‘no experience’ in the jobs in Canada search bar and filter by location, date posted, relevancy to your CV and more.
	
### 我可以在没有工作机会的情况下搬到加拿大吗？	Can I Move to Canada Without a Job Offer?
	
如果您申请永久居留权，您可以在没有工作机会的情况下移居加拿大。然而，拥有一份稳定的工作会有很长的路要走，特别是如果你没有任何经验的话。另一方面，如果你成功移民到加拿大并获得永久居留权，你被录用的机会就会增加，因此你可以等到移民后再找工作。	You can move to Canada without a job offer if you apply for permanent residency. However, having a secured job will go a long way, particularly if you don't have any experience. On the other hand, if you successfully immigrate to Canada and get permanent residency, your chances of getting hired increase and therefore you can wait until after you immigrate to secure a job position.
