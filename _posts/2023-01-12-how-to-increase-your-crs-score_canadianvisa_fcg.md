年复一年，来自世界各地的人们迈出申请加拿大公民的步伐。许多人都在寻找最快的移民成功之路，加拿大的快速通道系统已成为最受欢迎的选择之一。但是，虽然在申请过程中事情可能会以更快的速度发展，但不仅仅是填写文书工作并希望被邀请申请成为永久居民。	Year after year, people from all over the world take the step to apply for Canadian citizenship. With many looking for the quickest road to immigration success, Canada's Express Entry system has become one of the most favoured options. But, while things may move along at a more rapid pace during the application process, there's more to it than just filling out the paperwork and hoping to be invited to apply to become a permanent resident.
	
如果您打算走快速通道路线，您需要从一开始就牢记的一件事是如何提高您的综合排名系统 (CRS) 分数。	If you’re planning on going the Express Entry route, one of the things you need to keep in mind from the beginning is how to increase your Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) score.
	
每两周举行一次的抽奖有数千人提交，只有一小部分参赛者成功。抽签根据不同的移民类别进行，即联邦技术工人计划 (FSWP)、联邦技术贸易计划 (FSTP) 和加拿大经验类 (CEC) 计划。	With thousands of submissions for the draw, which takes place every two weeks, only a fraction of pool entries are successful. Draws take place according to various immigration categories, namely the Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP), the Federal Skilled Trades Program(FSTP), and the Canadian Experience Class (CEC) Program.
	
每次抽奖都有一个 CRS 截止点，将分数低于特定数字的抽奖淘汰。这使得知道如何提高您的 CRS 分数成为您申请过程的重要组成部分，因为它可以确保您有资格获得永久居留申请邀请 (ITA)。	There is a CRS cut-off for every draw, eliminating those with scores below a particular number. This makes knowing how to increase your CRS score an essential part of your application process, as it may ensure your eligibility for an Invitation To Apply (ITA) for permanent residency.

CRS 由加拿大移民、难民和公民部使用，是一个基于积分的系统，用于计算您在快速通道抽签池中的票价。作为候选人，我们会根据您的技能、资格和工作经验（仅举几例）对您的个人资料进行审查。您将在每个类别中进行评分，并最终获得 CRS 分数。在此过程中有机会获得高达 1,200 CRS 积分，分为核心或人力资本积分和附加积分。您可以根据多种因素获得积分，例如年龄、教育程度、语言、工作经验和您的技能。如果您有工作机会、说加拿大的第二语言，或者如果您在加拿大有兄弟姐妹，您将能够获得额外积分。	Used by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, the CRS is a system based on points that calculate how you will fare in the Express Entry draw pool. As a candidate, your profile is scrutinized according to your skill set, qualifications, and work experience, to name but a few factors. You will be graded in each category and eventually receive a CRS score. There is the opportunity to score up to 1,200 CRS points during the process, split into Core or Human Capital Points and Additional points. You earn points for a number of factors, such as age, education, languages, employment experience and your skills. You'll be able to earn additional points if you have a job offer, speak a second language spoken in Canada, or if you have a brother or sister in the country.
	
注意：快速通道池是一个竞争激烈的空间。如果你排名靠前，你被邀请申请成为永久居民的机会就更大。	NOTE: Express Entry pools are quite a competitive space. If you rank high, your chances of being invited to apply to become a permanent resident are better.
	
### IRCC 关于 Express Entry 和 CRS 分数的最新更新	Latest IRCC Update on Express Entry and CRS Scores
	
加拿大移民部长肖恩·弗雷泽 (Sean Fraser) 最近宣布对加拿大的快速通道系统进行一些更改，这些更改最早将于 2023 年第一季度生效。根据 2022 年 6 月发布的 C-19 法案显示，快速通道抽签将根据申请人的技能将为加拿大经济增加多少价值来定位申请人。过渡将使重点从仅 CRS 分数转移，而是看到吸引移民的抽签，这些移民最有助于在需要时弥合劳动力差距。您将必须满足快速入境计划的资格标准，但您的 CRS 分数将不再是获得 ITA 的主要决定因素。抽签可能以具有特定工作经验、教育或语言能力的候选人为中心。	Canada’s Immigration minister, Sean Fraser, recently announced some changes to Canada's Express Entry System that will come into play as early as the first quarter of 2023. According to Bill C-19, which was released in June 2022, revealed that Express Entry draws will be targeting applicants according to how much value their skills will add to the Canadian economy. The transition will see the focus shift away from only CRS scores and instead see draws that bring in immigrants that best aid bridging the labour gaps where needed. You will have to meet the eligibility criteria for an Express Entry program but your CRS Score will no longer be the main deciding factor in receiving an ITA. Draws may be centered around candidates with specific work experience, education, or language proficiency.
	
提高 CRS 分数的方法	Ways to Increase Your CRS Score
	
不确定如何提高您的 CRS 分数？好消息是，您可以遵循几个步骤来增加成功的机会：	Not sure how to increase your CRS score? The good news is that there are several steps you can follow to increase your chances of success:
	
1. 确保关注最新的快速通道移民新闻	1.  Make sure you follow the latest Express Entry Immigration News
2. 提升你的语言游戏	2.  Up your language game
3. 在您的列表中添加另一个资格	3.  Add another qualification to your list
4. 与您的配偶一起申请	4.  Apply with your spouse
5. 在加拿大找工作	5.  Secure a job in Canada
	
### 确保您关注最新的快速入境移民新闻	Make Sure You Follow the Latest Express Entry Immigration News
	
只要跟上移民界正在发生的事情，你就会惊讶于你会学到什么。您可能会学到以前不知道的技巧，这可能是您移民成功的关键。许多人可能不知道，在加拿大有兄弟姐妹可以保证为您的 CRS 分数增加 15 分。	You'll be amazed at what you'll pick up by just keeping abreast of what's happening in the world of immigration. You might pick up tips you weren't aware of before that might be the key to your immigration success. Many people might not be aware that having a sibling in Canada guarantees 15 points to add to your CRS Score.
	
确保您在英语测试中取得好成绩可以显着提高您的 CRS 分数。但不要就此止步。如果您还没有开始学习法语或者可以通过一些短语来学习，请专注于一些课程——如果您与配偶一起申请，第二语言可能会获得超过 20 分的加分。你的单独申请可以获得大约 24 分的加分。	Making sure you do well in your English test can significantly increase your CRS score. But don't stop there. If you haven't started learning French or can get by with a few phrases, focus on some classes – it's possible to score more than 20 extra points with a second language, should you apply with your spouse. You get about 24 extra points on your solo application.
	
### 添加另一个资格到您的列表	Add Another Qualification to Your List
	
学位需要一段时间才能完成，但添加另一个学位可能是值得的。这是提高分数的有保证的方法，因为您将获得额外的人力资本点数和更多的技能转移点数。	Degrees take a while to complete, but it may just be worth your while to add another one. It’s a guaranteed way to increase your score as you'll earn additional human capital points and earn more skills transferability points.
	
### 和你的配偶一起申请	Apply With Your Spouse
	
如果您和您的配偶或同居伴侣想移居加拿大，您可以一起申请签证。这种组合应用程序可能会显着提高您的 CRS 分数。在你们两人之间，你们需要根据谁拥有最多的 CRS 分数来决定谁是主申请人。如果你们都获得了 ITA，则需要共同提交 ITA 以获得永久居留权。	If you and your spouse or common-law partner would like to move to Canada, you'll be able to apply for a visa together. This combined application may dramatically increase your CRS score. Between the two of you, you'll need to decide which one of you would be the principal applicant, according to who has the most CRS points. Should you both be granted an ITA, you would be required to submit your ITA for permanent residence jointly.
	
### 在加拿大找到一份工作	Secure a Job in Canada
	
在开始签证申请程序之前确保就业是提高 CRS 分数的另一种方法。它将使您的分数增加约 200 分。但在开始之前，请注意并非所有工作都是平等的——它必须满足既定标准。您获得的职位必须是永久性的，并签订至少一年的合同。	Securing employment before starting the visa application process is another way to increase your CRS score. It would top up your score with about 200 points. But before you get into it, be aware that not all jobs are equal - it has to meet a set criterion. The position you secure would have to be permanent, with a contract signed for at least one year.

### 什么是良好的 CRS 分数？	What is a Good CRS Score?
	
！	!
	
CRS 分数因抽签而异，因此虽然超过 470 分的 CRS 分数会被视为不错的分数，但这确实取决于您所在的抽奖池。例如，在 2023 年的第一场抽奖中， 1 月 11 日，加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 向 5,500 名综合排名系统 (CRS) 最低分数为 507 分的候选人发出了邀请。	CRS scores vary from draw to draw, so while anything more than about 470 CRS points would be deemed a good score, it really does depend on the draw pool you find yourself in. For example, in the first draw of 2023, which took place on January 11, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) issued invitations to 5,500 candidates who had a minimum Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) score of 507 points.
	
**请记住：** 一个不错的分数可能并不总是意味着邀请申请居留权。	**Keep in mind:** A decent score may not always mean an invitation to apply for residency.
	
### 什么是截止分数？	What is a Cut-off Score?
	
每次抽奖都会有一个 CRS 截止分数。这是在收到永久居留申请邀请 (ITA) 时排名最低的个人的 CRS 分数。	With every draw comes a CRS cut-off score. This is the CRS score of the individual that ranked the lowest as they received an Invitation to Apply (ITA) for permanent residence.
	
### 如果我没有被邀请申请怎么办？	What if I'm Not Invited to Apply?
	
如果您的第一次尝试不成功，即使您不符合快速通道资格，也不会一无所获。您的个人资料会在池中保留 12 个月，让您有时间努力提高分数。还有许多其他签证选择可供选择，从省提名计划 (PNP) 到加拿大的创业和商务签证。	If your first attempt is unsuccessful, all is not lost, should you not qualify for Express Entry. Your profile stays in the pool for 12 months, giving you time to work on getting your score up. There are also a number of other visa options to pursue, from the Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) to Canada's Start-up and Business Visa.

This program allows participating provinces and territories to put forward qualifying economic immigration candidates for permanent residence in the country.
