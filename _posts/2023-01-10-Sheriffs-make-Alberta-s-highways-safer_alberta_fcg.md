* 交通违章与商用车安全 Traffic violations and commercial vehicle safety
* 商用车检查 Commercial vehicle inspections

2021 年，艾伯塔省政府通过提高艾伯塔省治安官的权力来应对农村犯罪和艾伯塔人的安全问题。现在，警长公路巡逻队能够调查酒后驾驶和其他刑事犯罪，以便艾伯塔人在该省的高速公路上行驶时感到更安全。In 2021, Alberta’s government worked to respond to rural crime and the safety concerns of Albertans by increasing the authority of Alberta Sheriffs. Now, the Sheriff Highway Patrol is able to investigate impaired driving and other criminal offences so that Albertans can feel safer when driving on the province’s highways.

2022 年，警长公路巡逻队将 1,471 名受损司机从其管辖的省级公路上移除。自从警长的权力扩大以来，共有 2,224 名受损司机已从艾伯塔省高速公路上撤离，即每天 4 名。In 2022, the Sheriff Highway Patrol removed 1,471 impaired drivers from provincial highways in its jurisdiction. Since the sheriffs’ authorities were expanded, a total of 2,224 impaired drivers have been removed from Alberta highways, or four every day.

> “加强警长公路巡逻队的权威是为艾伯塔省的每个人建设更安全社区的成功一步。治安官管辖的省道超过 30,000 公里，他们做了大量工作，在不到两年的时间内将 2,000 多名受损司机从我们的道路上赶走。扩大治安官的权力减轻了艾伯塔省农村地区的警务压力，使这些警官有更多时间响应紧急电话，并提供灵活性以确保我们社区的安全。”“Enhancing the authorities of the Sheriff Highway Patrol has been a successful step toward building safer communities for everyone in Alberta. With more than 30,000 km of provincial highways in their jurisdiction, the sheriffs have done tremendous work by removing more than 2,000 impaired drivers from our roads in less than two years. Expanding the sheriffs’ authorities has alleviated pressure for policing in rural Alberta, giving those officers more time to respond to urgent calls and provide the flexibility to keep our communities safer.”

在 2021 年之前，如果警长怀疑司机受到损害，他们必须将调查移交给当地警察部门——通常是加拿大阿尔伯塔省农村大部分地区的加拿大皇家骑警。Prior to 2021, if a sheriff suspected a driver was impaired, they were required to turn the investigation over to the local police service – usually the RCMP–in most parts of rural Alberta.

除了通过立即将受损司机赶出道路使阿尔伯塔省的高速公路更安全外，阿尔伯塔省警长执行受损驾驶执法的工作还为加拿大皇家骑警节省了大量调查时间，并帮助其巡逻队保持在道路上并能够应对其他罪行。In addition to making Alberta’s highways safer by immediately removing impaired drivers from the road, the work of Alberta Sheriffs to conduct impaired driving enforcement has saved the RCMP a considerable amount of investigative time and helped keep its patrol units on the road and able to respond to other offences.

交通违章和商用车安全Traffic violations and commercial vehicle safety

Sheriff Highway Patrol 的执法重点还包括超速、分心驾驶和商用车安全。 2022 年，治安官开出了 66,326 张与这些地区的违法行为和其他交通法规相关的罚单。The Sheriff Highway Patrol’s enforcement priorities also include speeding, distracted driving and commercial vehicle safety. In 2022, sheriffs wrote 66,326 tickets related to offences in those areas and other traffic regulations.

超速行驶会对艾伯塔省高速公路上的行人安全构成重大威胁，在艾伯塔省近 25% 的致命碰撞事故中，司机超过规定的限速或在天气和道路条件下行驶速度过快。当涉及极速时，风险只会变得更大——治安官在 2022 年遇到了几起案件，包括：Speeding can pose a significant threat to the safety of people on Alberta’s highways and nearly 25 per cent of fatal collisions in Alberta involve drivers exceeding the posted speed limit or travelling too fast for weather and road conditions. The risk only gets greater when extreme speed is involved – and sheriffs encountered several cases in 2022, including:

* 一名 39 岁的妇女在 Stony Plain 附近帕克兰县 16 号高速公路上的 110 公里/小时区域以 189 公里/小时的速度行驶。这名妇女也因酒精而受损。 a 39-year-old woman driving 189 km/h in a 110 km/h zone on Highway 16 in Parkland County near Stony Plain. The woman was also impaired by alcohol.

* 一名 20 岁的男子在埃德蒙顿西部帕克兰县 16 号高速公路上的 110 公里/小时区域以 228 公里/小时的速度行驶。 a 20-year-old man driving 228 km/h in a 110 km/h zone on Highway 16 in Parkland County west of Edmonton.

* 一名 25 岁男子以 203 公里/小时的速度在舍伍德公园外 21 号高速公路上的 100 公里/小时区域骑摩托车。 a 25-year-old man riding his motorcycle at 203 km/h in a 100 km/h zone on Highway 21 outside of Sherwood Park.

* 一名 33 岁男子以 195 公里/小时的速度在克罗湖附近的 63 号高速公路上以 110 公里/小时的速度行驶。这名男子持有毕业驾驶执照，要求酒精读数为零，但他也未能通过路边呼气测试。随后的调查还确定他非法逍遥法外，并因违反假释规定而被通缉。 a 33-year-old man driving 195 km/h in a 110 km/h zone on Highway 63 near Crow Lake. The man – who had a graduated driver’s licence requiring a zero alcohol reading – also failed a roadside breath test. Subsequent investigation also determined he was unlawfully at large and wanted for parole violations.

商用车检查Commercial vehicle inspections

作为商用车辆执法任务的一部分，警长公路巡逻队在主要交通路线上设有 17 个车辆检查站，并在全省各地设有 24 个流动检查站。自 2021 年 7 月获得执行酒后驾驶法律的权力以来，警长公路巡逻队已经逮捕了 80 名商业司机，这些商业司机超出了阿尔伯塔省对商业车辆驾驶毒品和酒精的零容忍标准。As part of its commercial vehicle enforcement mandate, the Sheriff Highway Patrol operates 17 vehicle inspection stations on major transportation routes and 24 mobile inspection stations in areas throughout the province. Since being given the authority to enforce impaired driving laws in July 2021, the Sheriff Highway Patrol has apprehended 80 commercial drivers exceeding Alberta's zero-tolerance standards for drug and alcohol use behind the wheel of commercial vehicles.

商用车辆执法不仅可以防止碰撞和其他安全隐患，还可以保护艾伯塔省的公路基础设施免受超重车辆造成的损害。有关商用车辆执法和艾伯塔省警长提供的其他服务的更多信息，请访问省执法网页。Commercial vehicle enforcement not only prevents collisions and other safety hazards, it also protects Alberta’s highway infrastructure from damage caused by overweight vehicles.
