# BREAKING：加拿大移民部长肖恩·弗雷泽 (Sean Fraser) 宣布延长 PGWP 持有人的工作许可	BREAKING: Canada’s Immigration Minister Sean Fraser announces work permit extension for PGWP holders The Post-Graduation Work Permit (PGWP) enables international students to gain Canadian work experience, which can help them transition to permanent resident status.
加拿大移民部长肖恩·弗雷泽 (Sean Fraser) 刚刚宣布，毕业后工作许可 (PGWP) 即将到期的人可以在 2023 年 4 月 6 日之前申请开放式工作许可延期。	Canada’s Immigration Minister Sean Fraser has just announced those with an expiring Post-Graduation Work Permit (PGWP) will be able to apply for an Open Work Permit extension as of April 6, 2023.
	
开放式工作许可证延期将适用于 PGWP 于 2023 年到期的任何人。它也适用于那些 PGWP 于 2022 年到期并于去年申请了 IRCC 的开放式工作许可证延期的人。	The Open Work Permit extension will be available to anyone whose PGWP expires in 2023. It will also be available to those whose PGWP expired in 2022 and applied for IRCC’s Open Work Permit extension last year.
	
从 4 月 6 日开始，候选人将能够在 IRCC 的网站上申请延期。那些申请者将收到一封电子邮件，其中包含临时工作许可证授权，他们可以向雇主出示该授权以继续在加拿大合法工作。	Beginning April 6, candidates will be able to apply for the extension on IRCC’s website. Those that apply will get an email with an interim work permit authorization which they can show employers to continue working legally in Canada.
	
那些在加拿大的合法身份已过期的人也可以同时申请恢复其身份，即使他们的身份已在加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 规定的 90 天宽限期之外到期。这意味着这些人最早可以在 4 月 6 日恢复身份并同时获得临时开放工作许可证授权。	Those whose legal status in Canada has expired will also be able to apply at the same time to restore their status, even if their status expired outside of the 90 day grace period that Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) provides. This means such individuals will be able to restore their status and get an interim Open Work Permit authorization at the same time, as early as April 6.

> 移民、难民和公民部部长 Sean Fraser 阁下将就毕业后工作许可 (PGWP) 发布公告。弗雷泽部长将与 Etobicoke-Lakeshore 国会议员 James Maloney 一起。 ----尊敬的肖恩·弗雷泽 (Sean Fraser)，移民、难民和公民部长，毕业后工作许可 (PTPD)。	> The Honourable Sean Fraser, Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship, will make an announcement regarding post-graduation work permits (PGWPs). Minister Fraser will be joined by James Maloney, Member of Parliament for Etobicoke-Lakeshore. —- L’honorable Sean Fraser, ministre de l’Immigration, des Réfugiés et de la Citoyenneté, fera le point sur les permis de travail postdiplôme (PTPD).
	
IRCC 表示，它将向有资格获得延期的人发送消息，邀请他们从 4 月 6 日开始登录他们的在线 IRCC 安全账户。	IRCC says it will send messages to those who are eligible for the extension to invite them to log into their online IRCC Secure Account starting on April 6.
	
从加拿大指定学习机构 (DLI) 的合格教育课程毕业的国际学生可以获得毕业后工作许可 (PGWP)。	Post-Graduation Work Permits (PGWP) are available to international students who graduate from an eligible educational program at a Canadian designated learning institution (DLI).
	
DLIs是政府批准的接受国际学生的学院、大学和其他教育机构。	DLIs are colleges, universities, and other educational institutions approved by the government to welcome international students.
	
PGWP 使国际毕业生能够在加拿大为他们选择的任何雇主工作最长三年（PGWP 的长度取决于国际毕业生完成的教育计划的长度）。	PGWPs enable international graduates to work for any employer of their choice in Canada for a maximum duration of three years (the length of a PGWP is determined by the length of the educational program completed by the international graduate).
	
由于加拿大经济类移民项目的性质，PGWP 深受国际学生的追捧。	PGWPs are highly coveted by international students due to the nature of Canada’s economic class immigration programs.
	
其中许多项目奖励在加拿大学习和工作过的候选人。	Many of these programs rewards candidates who have studied and worked in Canada.
	
这背后的基本原理是加拿大统计局的研究表明，这种学习和工作经验有助于支持国际学生融入劳动力市场，他们将成为加拿大永久居民。	The rationale behind this is Statistics Canada research showing that such study and work experience can help to support the labour market integration of international students who go on to become Canadian permanent residents.
	
获得加拿大教育、工作经验、提高英语或法语技能以及在加拿大发展社交网络的结合，都被认为有助于这些移民候选人的经济融合。	The combination of gaining a Canadian education, plus work experience, improving one’s English or French skills, and developing social networks in Canada are all thought to contribute to the economic integration of these immigration candidates.
	
因此，某些途径，如联邦快速通道系统，为那些有加拿大学习和工作经验的人提供更多加分。	As such, certain pathways, such as the federal Express Entry system, offer more points to those with Canadian study and work experience.
	
此外，还有专为国际毕业生提供的省级途径，例如通过省提名计划 (PNP)。	In addition, there are provincial pathways, such as through the Provincial Nominee Program (PNP), available specifically to international graduates.
	
大多数加拿大国际学生表示有兴趣申请永久居留权。	The majority of Canada’s international students report an interest in applying for permanent residence.
	
加拿大对全球人才的接受度，包括其不断增加的移民水平，都有助于提高国际学生水平。	Canada’s receptiveness to global talent, including its increasing immigration levels are contributing to higher international student levels.
	
到 2022 年底，加拿大接待了超过 800,000 名国际学生，创历史新高。	Canada was host to over 800,000 international students at the end of 2022, an all-time record.
	
PGWP 持有人很容易占过渡到永久居留权 (PR) 的临时居民 (TR) 的大多数。	PGWP holders easily account for the majority of temporary residents (TRs) who transition to permanent residence (PR).
	
2022 年，近 98,000 名 PGWP 持有人成为永久居民，约占所有成为永久居民的 TR 的 82%。	In 2022, nearly 98,000 PGWP holders became permanent residents, which is about 82 per cent of all TRs who became PRs.
	
加拿大希望在 2023 年迎来创纪录的 465,000 名新永久居民，这一目标将在 2025 年上升到 500,000 名。	Canada is looking to welcome a record 465,000 new permanent residents in 2023, and this will rise to a target of 500,000 in 2025.
	
加拿大没有寻求从 TR 过渡到 PR 的目标，但 Fraser 部长一再表示他希望促进这种过渡。	Canada does not have a target of TRs it seeks to transition to PR, but Minister Fraser has stated repeatedly his desire to facilitate such transitions.
	
正如总理贾斯汀·特鲁多 (Justin Trudeau) 向他提供的授权信中所述，弗雷泽部长的优先事项之一是通过快速通道促进更多 TR 到 PR 的过渡。	One of Minister Fraser’s priorities, as outlined in the mandate letter provided to him by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, is to facilitate more TR to PR transitions via Express Entry.
	
由于 PGWP 持有者成为永久居民的强烈需求，IRCC 近年来做出了两次例外，允许那些 PGWP 到期的人申请开放式工作许可延期。	Due to the strong demand for PGWP holders to become permanent residents, IRCC has made two exceptions in recent years, enabling those with expiring PGWPs to apply for Open Work Permit extensions.
	
这些例外的目的是让这些人有更多时间获得永久居留权。	The purpose of these exceptions has been to give these individuals more time to potentially obtain permanent residence.
	
最后一个例外适用于那些 PGWP 在 2021 年 9 月至 2022 年 12 月底之间到期的人。	The last exception was available to those whose PGWP expired between September 2021 and the end of December 2022.
	
IRCC 指出，截至 2022 年底，加拿大有超过 286,000 名 PGWP 持有人。约有 127,000 名 PGWP 持有人将于 2023 年到期，但约有 67,000 名 PGWP 持有人已经申请永久居留，无需通过该计划延长工作许可。	IRCC notes there were more than 286,000 PGWP holders in Canada at the end of 2022. About 127,000 PGWPs expire in 2023, however about 67,000 PGWP holders have already applied for permanent residence and will not need to extend their work permit through this initiative.
