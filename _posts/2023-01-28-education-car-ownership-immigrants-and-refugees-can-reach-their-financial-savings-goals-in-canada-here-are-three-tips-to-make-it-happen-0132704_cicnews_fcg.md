Most people (81 per cent) are paying close attention to their finances so they can afford their needs before focusing on their wants.

**新移民储蓄秘诀 #1：专注于您的储蓄目标**	**Newcomer savings tip #1: Focus on your savings goals**
	
确定您的储蓄目标，无论是拥有房屋、购买汽车还是为专业发展课程储蓄以帮助您发展事业。使用财务目标计算器等工具来记录您的财务目标，并预测您实现这些目标需要多长时间。同样，请确保记录您所有的储蓄来源并跟踪您的进度，包括每月余额和每月供款。了解如果需要，您可以多快获得这些资金，以及从某些账户提取资金的任何处罚。	Identify your savings goals, whether that includes owning a home, buying a car or saving for a professional development course to help grow your career. Use a tool like a financial goal calculator to capture your financial goals and project how long it will take you to reach those goals. As well, make sure to capture all your savings sources and track your progress including monthly balance(s) and monthly contribution(s). Understand how quickly you can access these funds if needed and any penalties for withdrawing funds from certain accounts.

想要更快地达到您的储蓄目标？增加收入是加速这一过程的一种策略。 Wan 表示，Windmill Microlending 的客户在完成教育或培训并还清小额贷款后，收入增长了三倍多（准确地说是 3.5 倍）。具备在加拿大就业市场取得成功的技能和知识，这些人更容易找到收入更高的工作，使他们在新国家取得职业成功。 Wan 补充说，有了 Windmill 新的固定利率产品，新移民最多可以借到 15,000 美元，并且在偿还贷款时有一定的成本确定性。	Want to reach your savings goals, faster? Increasing your income is one strategy to accelerate the process. Wan says Windmill Microlending clients grow their incomes more than three-times (3.5x to be exact) after completing their education or training and paying off their microloan. Equipped with the skills and knowledge to succeed in the Canadian job market, these individuals are more easily able to find higher income work that positions them for career success in their new country. Adds Wan, with Windmill’s new fixed interest rate offering, newcomers can borrow up to $15,000, and have some cost certainty when it comes repaying their loan.
	
她还建议新移民谨慎管理债务，并意识到管理不善可能会对您未来的借款产生影响。值得注意的是，来到 Windmill 的客户通常在加拿大几乎没有信用记录，尽管如此，他们仍然有资格获得负担得起的贷款。	She also advises newcomers manage debt carefully and be aware that mismanaging it can have an impact on your future borrowing. Of note, clients often come to Windmill with little to no credit history in Canada and, despite this, can still be eligible for an affordable loan.

**新移民储蓄提示 #3：跟踪您的进度**	**Newcomer savings tip #3: Track your progress**
	
在这里，您应该考虑如何跟踪实现财务目标的进度，并考虑要养成哪些储蓄习惯。例如，设置自动转账，将每张支票的一小部分存入储蓄账户。其他人则使用四舍五入的借记卡，在每次购买时将金额四舍五入，并自动将多余的零钱转入他们的储蓄。同样，您可以请朋友或支持者帮助您朝着财务目标迈进。	Here, you should consider how you’re going to track your progress toward your financial goal and consider what savings habits you’ll want to institute. For example, setting up automatic transfers to put a small part of each pay cheque into a savings account. Others use a round-up debit card that rounds the amount up on every purchase and automatically transfers the spare change into their savings. As well, you could ask a friend or support person to help you stay on track towards your financial goals.
	
Wan 观察到，许多新移民在刚到加拿大时并没有每月预算的经验，但这是有效增加您的财务储蓄并更接近您的目标的关键一步。	Wan has observed that many newcomers don’t have experience with monthly budgeting, when they first arrive in Canada, but this is a critical step to effectively growing your financial savings and getting closer to your goals.
	
“如果您不跟踪每月开支，很容易超支并依赖信用卡或个人贷款。只有通过预算，新移民才能看到他们是否有盈余来投资和储蓄，或者是否有赤字，以审查开支，或者寻找一份收入更高的工作，”她建议道。	“It is easy to overspend and rely on credit cards or personal loans if you do not track monthly expenses. It is only by budgeting that newcomers will see if they are in surplus to invest and save, or in deficit, to review expenses, or seek a job with a better income,” she advises.
