加拿大增强了其快速通道跟踪器。	Canada has enhanced its Express Entry tracker.
	
作为加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 使加拿大移民流程现代化的举措的一部分，IRCC 已将当前的申请状态跟踪器扩展到四个快速入境计划业务领域：	As part of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada’s (IRCC) move to modernize the Canadian immigration process, IRCC has expanded the current Application Status Tracker to four Express Entry Program Lines of Business:
	
· 加拿大体验班；	· Canadian Experience Class;
	
· 联邦技术工人计划；	· Federal Skilled Worker Program;
	
· 联邦技工项目；和，	· Federal Skilled Trades Program; and,
	
· 省提名计划。	· Provincial Nominee Program.
	
Express Entry 候选人和代表现在可以在前面提到的业务范围内查看他们的 Express Entry 申请历史。	Express Entry candidates and representatives are now able to view the history of their Express Entry applications under the previously-mentioned lines of business.
	
您将能够访问以跟踪您的申请进度，以及检查：	You will be able access to follow the progress of your application, as well as to check:

### IRCC 的现代化工作	IRCC’s modernization efforts
	
在移民申请上安装跟踪器可以让用户看到他们在流程中的位置，并采取任何必要的行动来保持申请的顺利进行。它还通过向他们提供与他们联系 IRCC 客户服务代理时将获得的相同信息来帮助提高透明度。	Having trackers on immigration applications allows users to see where they are in the process and take any actions needed to keep the application moving along. It also aids in transparency by giving them the same information they would get if they contacted an IRCC client service agent.
	
跟踪器也将支持 IRCC 端的效率。 IRCC 在其客户支持中心定期通过电话和电子邮件收到大量应用程序更新请求。该跟踪器旨在帮助客户及时获得对其申请查询的答复。	The tracker will support efficiency on IRCC’s end as well. IRCC regularly receives a high volume of application update requests by phone and by email at their Client Support Centre. The tracker is meant to help clients  get timely answers to their application inquiries.
	
大流行加速了 IRCC 促进现代化的需要。因此，在过去的两年里，加拿大政府一直在努力完善移民制度。	The pandemic accelerated IRCC’s need to boost modernization. As such, over the past two years the Canadian government has made efforts to improve the immigration system.
	
例如，截至去年 10 月，大多数以前基于纸质的 PR 申请流程现在都在线进行。	For example, as of this past October, most PR application processes that were previously paper-based are now online.
	
IRCC 新更新的快速通道和 PNP 追踪器是在 IRCC 为配偶担保申请人推出追踪器一年后推出的。	IRCC’s new updated Express Entry and PNP tracker comes one year after IRCC launched a tracker for spousal sponsorship applicants.
	
在线申请跟踪器的开发是 IRCC 为客户提供有意义和透明的信息以及为现在和未来的新移民提供数字化服务的努力的一部分。	The development of online application trackers is part of IRCC’s efforts to provide meaningful and transparent information to clients, and to digitize services for newcomers of the present and future.
