加拿大制作的新纪录片《寻找自由》与四名寻求庇护者一起踏上旅程，重点关注难民的困境，包括某些难民拘留中心令人不安的现实，以及他们在加拿大等国家获得自由后所面临的挑战。这部发人深省的电影由加拿大人 Mel D'Souza（SILO Entertainment）和导演艾伦戈德曼制作，使用难民自己通过走私手机提供的镜头，讲述令人不安的监狱般条件和每天侵犯人权的行为。	A new Canadian-made documentary _Finding Freedom_ goes on a journey with four asylum seekers and draws focus on the plight of refugees, including the disturbing realities of certain refugee detention centres, and the challenges they face even after finding freedom in countries like Canada.  This thought-provoking film, produced by Canadians Mel D’Souza (SILO Entertainment) and director Alan Goldman, uses footage provided by the refugees themselves from their smuggled cellphones on the disturbing prison-like conditions and the daily violations to their human rights.
	
导演艾伦戈德曼说：“这部纪录片的最终目的是要表明，虽然影片中的人物现在已经自由了，但他们的伤疤和创伤将伴随他们一生，作为一名电影制作人，我觉得有责任提高人们的认识在雷达下发生的侵犯人权行为——促使观众质疑他们的信仰并问“这就是公民社会的行为方式”。	“The ultimate aim of the documentary is to show that although the people featured in it are now free, their scars and wounds will haunt them for a lifetime,” says director Alan Goldman, “As a filmmaker, I feel a responsibility to raise awareness of the human rights violations happening under the radar — to push audiences to question their beliefs and ask ‘is this how a civil society behaves.”
	
该纪录片重点介绍了私人难民赞助者和组织的工作，并阐述了为难民提供有尊严的移民和重新安置过程的道德责任。	The documentary highlights the work of private refugee sponsors and organizations, and addresses the ethical responsibility to provide refugees a dignified immigration and resettlement process.

**难民的私人赞助**	**Private sponsorship of refugees**
	
纪录片中出现的两名难民 Amin 和 Amir（为保护隐私不公开姓氏）抵达了不列颠哥伦比亚省。通过加拿大的难民私人赞助 (PSR) 计划。	Two of the refugees featured in the documentary, Amin and Amir (last names not shared to protect privacy) arrived in B.C. through Canada’s Private Sponsorship of Refugees (PSR) program.
	
Amin 于 2021 年 12 月抵达加拿大，由总部位于不列颠哥伦比亚省的安置机构 MOSAIC 赞助。在纪录片中，MOSAIC 的私人难民赞助计划因其创新和国际伙伴关系而获得联合国的认可。自 2017 年以来，MOSAIC 总共赞助了大约 680 人，从 2017 年的仅 6 人迅速增加到 2022 年的 212 人。	Amin, who arrived in Canada in December 2021, was sponsored by B.C.-based settlement agency MOSAIC. Featured in the documentary, MOSAIC’s Private Refugee Sponsorship Program has been recognized by the United Nations for its innovation and international partnerships.  Since 2017, MOSAIC has been able to sponsor a total of approximately 680 individuals, upscaling rapidly from only 6 individuals in 2017 to 212 individuals sponsored in 2022.
	
“难民重新安置的需求不断增加，私人难民赞助将继续成为加拿大难民重新安置工作的重要组成部分。虽然需求总是大于我们提供帮助的能力，但 MOSAIC 的私人难民赞助计划将尽其所能协助重新安置，”MOSAIC 的项目经理 Iris Challoner 说。	“The need for refugee resettlement is ever increasing and private refugee sponsorship will continue to be an important part of Canada’s refugee resettlement efforts. While the need will always be greater that our ability to help, MOSAIC’s Private Refugee Sponsorship program will do its part to assist with resettlement where able,” says Iris Challoner, MOSAIC’s manager of the program.
	
加拿大的 PSR 计划成立于 1979 年，在全球范围内产生了深远的影响。该计划让私人团体赞助符合条件的海外难民。团体包括赞助协议持有人 (SAH)，他们与政府签署协议以帮助支持来到加拿大的难民；资助难民在其社区定居的五名加拿大公民或永久居民；社区赞助者是赞助难民的组织、协会或公司。	Set up in 1979, Canada’s PSR program has been making a meaningful impact worldwide. The program lets private groups sponsor eligible refugees abroad. Groups include Sponsorship Agreement Holders (SAH) who sign agreements with the government to help support refugees when they come to Canada; Groups of Five Canadian citizens or permanent residents who sponsor refugees to settle in their communities; and Community Sponsors who are organizations, associations or corporations that sponsor refugees.
