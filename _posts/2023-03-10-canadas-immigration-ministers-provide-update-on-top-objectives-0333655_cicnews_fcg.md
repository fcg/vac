# 加拿大移民部长提供有关首要目标的最新信息负责移民事务的部长论坛今天举行会议，讨论如何实现共同的优先事项。	Canada’s immigration ministers provide update on top objectives The Forum of Ministers Responsible for Immigration met today to discuss how to achieve shared priorities.
负责移民事务的部长论坛 (FMRI) 今天在哈利法克斯再次举行了中期会议。	The Forum of Ministers Responsible for Immigration (FMRI) has met again for its midterm meeting today in Halifax.
	
会议每年举行两次，最后一次于 7 月 28 日在新不伦瑞克省的圣约翰举行。	The meetings take place twice per year, and last occurred in Saint John, New Brunswick, on July 28.
	
FMRI 由负责移民事务的联邦、省和地区部长组成。这些会议是两级政府讨论加拿大移民优先事项的场所。	The FMRI is comprised of federal, provincial, and territorial ministers responsible for immigration. The meetings act as a venue for the two levels of government to discuss Canada’s top immigration priorities.
	
在上次会议上，部长们的目标是最大限度地提高移民系统的有效性，以满足经济和地区需求，包括增加省/地区 (PT) 在选择过程中的参与。	In their last meeting, the ministers aimed to maximize the effectiveness of the immigration system to meet economic and regional needs, including increasing provincial/territorial (PT) involvement in the selection process.
	
他们还寻求对快速通道现代化的更多投入，并增加 PT 提名计划 (PNP) 的分配。最后，各省的目标是在 2023 年 3 月 31 日之前及时提供多年拨款。	They also sought more input into Express Entry modernization and to increase the allocations of the PT Nominee Programs (PNPs). Finally, the provinces aimed to provide timely multi-year allocations before March 31st, 2023.
	
在今天的会议上，部长们积极地谈到了加拿大对移民的支持，以及他们如何能够在去年夏天制定的目标的基础上再接再厉。	In today’s meeting, the ministers spoke positively about the support for immigration in Canada and how they have been able to build on objectives outlined last summer.
	
## **多年省提名计划和大西洋移民计划**	**Multi-year Provincial Nominee Program and Atlantic Immigration Program Plan**
	
值得注意的是，部长们已经批准了有史以来第一个新的多年省提名计划（PNP）和大西洋移民计划（AIP）计划。该计划将更好地帮助各省和地区提前规划移民接纳和安置。新不伦瑞克省负责移民事务的部长阿琳邓恩代表各省和地区表示，各省和地区最适合选择经济移民。邓恩部长表示，扩大 PNP、AIP 以及农村和北部移民试点将有助于减少 IRCC 积压并缩短处理时间，从而更好地为客户服务并满足他们的需求。该计划包括 2023 年 PNP 拨款增长 44%。	Notably, the ministers have endorsed the first-ever new multi-year Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) and Atlantic Immigration Program (AIP) plan. This plan will better help the provinces and territories outline their immigrant admissions and settlement in advance. Speaking on behalf of the provinces and territories, Arlene Dunn, the minister responsible for immigration in New Brunswick, said that provinces and territories are best placed to select economic immigrants. Minister Dunn said expanding the PNP, AIP and Rural and Northern Immigration Pilot will help reduce the IRCC backlog and improve processing times to better serve clients and meet their needs. The plan includes a 44% growth in PNP allocations for 2023.
	
部长们还表示，加快处理时间将有助于减少系统中的重复，这反过来又会导致积压。他们承认为新移民寻找负担得起的住房所面临的新挑战，以及目前全国范围内安置服务的压力。	The ministers also said that speeding processing times would help reduce duplication in the system, which in turn contributes to the backlog. They acknowledged the emerging challenge of finding affordable housing for new immigrants as well as current stress on settlement services nationwide. 
	
部长们还在寻找方法，通过彼此之间以及与劳工部长、雇主和商会等利益相关者的更多合作，来加强获得教育证书评估 (ECA) 或外国证书认可的过程。他们强调了关键领域，包括选择阶段、了解复杂的监管环境和提高 FCR 抵达前信息共享的质量。快速获得证书认可是新人充分发挥其专业潜力的关键步骤。	The ministers are also looking for ways to enhance the process of obtaining an Educational Credential Assessment (ECA) or foreign credential recognition, by collaborating more with each other as well as stakeholders such as labour ministers, employers, and chambers of commerce.  They highlighted  key areas including in the selection stage, understanding the complex regulatory environment and advancing the quality of FCR pre-arrival information sharing. Obtaining an credential recognition quickly is a key step for a newcomer to practice their professionals at their full potential. 
	
“加强加拿大移民政策和计划的伙伴关系、协作和共同愿景是联邦、省和地区政府应对不断变化的移民形势的核心，”邓恩部长说。 “通过今天的会议，我们希望建立势头，进一步明确我们各自政府在成功吸引、融合和留住移民方面的作用和责任。”	“Partnership, collaboration, and a shared vision for enhancing Canada’s immigration policies and programs are at the centre of how federal, provincial, and territorial governments navigate the everchanging immigration landscape,” said Minister Dunn. “Through today’s meeting we looked to build momentum to further clarify the roles and responsibilities of our respective governments to successfully attract, integrate, and retain immigrants.”
	
## 对移民的共同管辖权	Shared jurisdiction over immigration
	
自加拿大于 1867 年成立以来，省政府和联邦政府共同承担移民责任。这些会议的主要目标是促进移民在整个加拿大的传播。	Since Canada was founded in 1867, the provincial and federal governments have shared responsibility for immigration. The main objective of these conferences is promoting the spread of immigration throughout Canada.
	
这种共同责任的主要组成部分之一是省提名计划 (PNP)。除魁北克省和努纳武特省外，每个省都有自己的 PNP，永久居留 (PR) 候选人可以通过该 PNP 表明对在特定省份工作和生活的偏好。魁北克有自己的移民系统。	One of the main components of this shared responsibility is the Provincial Nominee Program (PNP). Each province, with the exceptions of Quebec and Nunavut, operates its own PNP through which candidates for permanent residency (PR) can indicate a preference to work and live in a specific province. Quebec operates its own immigration system.
	
如果省政府认为候选人可以轻松融入劳动力队伍并支持省经济，他们可能会向他们提供省提名。获得提名并不自动意味着候选人是永久居民，但可以加强他们向联邦政府的申请。	If the provincial government believes the candidate can easily integrate into the workforce and support the provincial economy, they may offer them a provincial nomination. Getting nominated does not automatically mean that the candidate is a permanent resident, but it can strengthen their application to the federal government.
	
最终，加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 对邀请多少候选人根据 PNP 申请永久居留权拥有最终决定权。每年根据移民水平计划，IRCC 都会概述全国 PNP 录取目标。几个月后，它将个人的 PNP 目标传达给每个省和地区。	Ultimately, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) has the final say in how many candidates are invited to apply for PR under a PNP. Each year under the Immigration Levels Plan, IRCC outlines the national PNP admissions target. It then communicates individual PNP targets to each province and territory a few months later.
	
在去年夏天的会议上，由于劳动力短缺以及希望对定居的经济移民及其缩小劳动力差距的能力有更多控制权，PT 部长们主张增加拨款。	In the meeting last summer, PT ministers advocated for higher allocations due to labour shortages and a desire to have more control over the economic immigrants who settle and their ability to close their labour force gaps.
	
2023-2025 年移民水平计划表明，到 2025 年，PNP 录取人数将继续超过联邦高技能（快速通道）录取人数。	The Immigration Levels Plan 2023-2025 shows that PNP admissions will continue to outpace federal high skilled (Express Entry) admissions into 2025.
	
各省和地区定期举行移民抽签。本周，不列颠哥伦比亚省、安大略省和马尼托巴省举行了 PNP 抽签，而魁北克则在自己的系统下举行了抽签。	Provinces and territories hold immigration draws routinely. This week, British Columbia, Ontario, and Manitoba have held PNP draws, while Quebec held a draw under its own system.
