您一直在加拿大生活和工作，持有加拿大国际经验 **(IEC) 工作假期** 签证，老实说，这真是太棒了。因此，在可预见的未来留在加拿大是一个不错的选择。	You've been living and working in Canada on your International Experience Canada **(IEC) Working Holiday** Visa, and, let's be honest, it's been amazing. So, staying in Canada for the foreseeable future is a great option.
	
不幸的是，您的打工度假签证即将到期。这意味着您可能不得不离开这个您已经深爱的国家。幸运的是，情况并非如此。由于加拿大在国际移民方面的开放政策 - 即使在您的 **IEC 工作假期** 签证到期后，仍有许多途径可以留在加拿大。	Unfortunately, your Working Holiday visa will expire soon. This means you may have to leave the country you've grown to love so much. Fortunately, this doesn't have to be the case. Thanks to Canada's open-door policy regarding international immigration - there are many pathways to stay in Canada even after your **IEC working holiday** visa expires.
	
假设您想继续在加拿大工作。您可以开始在加拿大世界一流的教育机构之一学习，或将加拿大作为您永久的家。在这种情况下，有几条重要的途径适合您。	Suppose you want to continue working in Canada. You can start studying at one of Canada's world-class educational institutions or make Canada your permanent home. In that case, there are several significant pathways for you.
	
本文将分解每条途径、标准以及如何申请，确保您的加拿大梦不会结束。	This article will break down each pathway, the criteria, and how to apply, ensuring your Canadian dream doesn't have to end.
	
加拿大永久居留权 (Canada PR)	Canadian Permanent Residence (Canada PR)
	
!加拿大公关	!Canada PR
	
获得加拿大永久居留权可以让您永久留在加拿大，并有机会申请完全的加拿大公民身份。	Gaining Canada PR allows you to stay in Canada permanently and have the opportunity to apply for full Canadian citizenship.
	
### 快速通道	Express Entry
	
虽然外国公民可以通过许多项目获得加拿大永久居留权，但最受欢迎的**加拿大永久居留权程序**是快速通道系统。这是最普遍的首选途径，因为它是获得永久居留权的最快途径，因为快速入境计划下的**加拿大永久居留程序**可能只需要六个月。	While there are dozens of programs through which foreign nationals can get Canada PR, the most popular **Canada PR process** is the Express Entry system. It's the most commonly preferred route since it's the fastest route to gaining permanent residency, as the **Canada PR process** under the Express Entry Program can take as little as six months.
	
**加拿大公关流程**是基于抽签的。首先，申请人在加拿大政府的快速通道门户网站上创建个人资料。然后，他们输入年龄、教育水平、工作经验、婚姻状况、适应能力、工作机会和语言能力等详细信息。这些因素被评估并转换为综合排名系统 (CRS) 分数。然后，大约每两周进行一次快速通道抽签，CRS 分数最高的人将收到永久居留申请邀请 (ITA)。	The **Canada PR process** is draw-based. First, applicants create a profile on the Canadian government's Express Entry web portal. Then, they enter details like age, level of education, work experience, marital status, adaptability, job offers and language ability. These factors are evaluated and converted into a Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) score. Then, approximately every two weeks, an Express Entry draw takes place, and those with the highest CRS scores are issued an Invitation To Apply (ITA) for permanent residence.
	
一旦申请人的 Express Entry 资料完整并且他们的 CRS 分数得到有效计算，申请就会被放入三个申请流之一。它们如下：	Once an applicant's Express Entry profile is complete and their CRS score is effectively calculated, the application is placed into one of three application streams. They are as follows:
	
#### 联邦技术工人计划 (FSWP)	The Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP)
	
联邦技术工人计划专为拥有专业职业有效学位的申请人设计。	The Federal Skilled Worker Program is specifically designed for applicants with a valid degree in a professional occupation.
	
#### 联邦技术贸易计划 (FSTP)	The Federal Skilled Trade Program (FSTP)
	
联邦技术贸易计划适用于在特定行业具有有效资格的技术工人，例如文凭 - 它适用于在加拿大至少有一年有效工作机会的技术工人。	The Federal Skilled Trade Program is for skilled workers with a valid qualification in a specific trade, such as a diploma - it is for skilled workers with a valid job offer for at least one year in Canada.
	
#### 加拿大经验类 (CEC)	Canada Experience Class (CEC)
	
Canada Experience Class专门针对过去12个月在加拿大生活和工作过的技术工人。	Canada Experience Class is specifically for skilled workers who have lived and worked in Canada in the last 12 months.
	
如果您的**IEC Working Holiday**签证允许您在加拿大停留一年以上，您可以通过加拿大经验类别申请加拿大永久居民。	If your **IEC Working Holiday** visa has allowed you to stay in Canada for over a year, you can apply for Canada PR through the Canada Experience Class.
	
假设您计划通过快速通道获得永久居留权；您必须在工作假期签证到期前至少六个月申请，以便完成加拿大永久居民程序。	Suppose you plan on gaining permanent residence via Express Entry; you must apply at least six months before your Working Holiday Visa expires, allowing the Canada PR process to be completed.
	
### 省提名计划 (PNP)	Provincial Nominee Programs (PNPs)
	
如果不提及 PNP，任何关于加拿大永久居留权的讨论都是不完整的。由于加拿大幅员辽阔，省份众多，每个省份都有自己的经济、重点产业和劳动力市场。	Any discussion of permanent residency in Canada is incomplete without mentioning the PNPs. As Canada is a massive country with multiple provinces, each province has its economies, key industries and labour markets.
	
为了促进这种差异并确保满足每个省份的需求，13 个省份中有 11 个省份设有 PNP，帮助具有特定省份所需技能的工人快速轻松地获得永久居留权。	To facilitate this difference and ensure each province's needs are catered for, 11 out of the 13 provinces have PNPs which help workers with skills needed in specific provinces gain permanent residency quickly and easily.
	
每个省都有多个 PNP 流，以涵盖不同的行业、申请人和技能组合。每个 PNP 的资格标准因您所在的省和流而有很大差异。尽管如此，有资格获得 PNP 的主要因素之一是拥有需求技能或获得需求职业的工作机会。每个省份都有不同的当前需求的职业。通过这张地图，您可以看到加拿大各省对哪些职业有需求。	Each province has multiple PNP streams to cover different industries, applicants and skill sets. The eligibility criteria for each PNP differ massively depending on your province and stream. Still, one of the major factors in qualifying for a PNP is having in-demand skills or getting a job offer in an in-demand occupation. Each province has different occupations that are currently in demand. With this map, you can see which occupations are in demand in each Canadian province.
	
	  
	
申请加拿大 PNP 有两种方式。最流行的方式是通过您的快速通道个人资料进行申请。那些通过快速入境系统申请加拿大永久居民的人可以通过获得省提名来最大限度地提高获得 ITA 的几率。假设申请人在提交快速入境申请时提交省提名。在这种情况下，他们的 CRS 分数将额外获得 600 分，有效地保证他们在下一次快速通道抽签时获得 ITA。	There are two ways to apply for a Canadian PNP. The most popular way is to apply via your Express Entry profile. Those applying for Canada PR via the Express Entry System can have their odds of gaining an ITA maximized by getting a Provincial Nomination. Suppose applicants submit a provincial nomination with their Express Entry application. In that case, they will gain an extra 600 points to their CRS score, effectively guaranteeing them an ITA at the next Express Entry draw.
	
申请人可以通过快速通道系统或纸质申请。要通过快速入境系统申请，您必须在创建快速入境资料时选择在特定省份提交意向书 (EOI)。如果您有资格获得 PNP，您将收到一份永久居留确认书 (COPR)，您将与快速入境所需的文件一起提交。	Applicants can apply via the Express Entry system or on paper. To apply via the Express Entry system, you must choose to submit an Expression of Interest (EOI) in a specific province when you create your Express Entry Profile. If you qualify for a PNP, you will receive a Confirmation of Permanent Residence (COPR), which you will submit with your required documentation for Express Entry.
	
如果您以书面形式申请，您可以直接向该省申请，并直接从您选择的省份获得永久居留权。虽然这意味着您不必通过快速通道系统进行申请，但此过程可能需要相当长的时间，因为它依赖于邮政服务，并且可能因您所在的位置而有很大差异。	If you apply on paper, you can apply directly to the province and receive your permanent residence directly from your chosen province. While this means that you will not have to apply through the Express Entry system, this process can take considerably longer as it relies on postal services and can vary wildly depending on your location.

### 家庭赞助	Family Sponsorship
	
如果您的家人或伴侣是加拿大公民或永久居民，如果他们赞助您，您可能有机会获得加拿大永久居留权。	If you have family or a partner who is a Canadian citizen or permanent resident, you may have a chance at getting Canadian permanent residency if they sponsor you.
	
这也非常受欢迎，因为它不需要加拿大的工作机会或高等教育。要获得赞助，您的赞助商必须是：	This is also hugely popular as it does not require a Canadian job offer or tertiary education. To be sponsored, your sponsor must be:
	
* 18岁以上	  Over age 18
* 加拿大公民或永久居民	  A Canadian citizen or permanent resident
* 拥有足够的钱来支持你在加拿大期间的生活	  In possession of enough money to support you while you’re in Canada
	
根据您与担保人的关系，您可以申请多种家庭担保计划。在此处详细了解您的亲人如何通过加拿大的家庭赞助计划延长他们在加拿大的时间。	There are multiple family sponsorship programs that you can apply for based on your relationship with your sponsor. Learn more about how your loved ones can extend their time in Canada with Canada's family sponsorship programs here. 
	
如何申请加拿大永久居民	How to Apply for Canada PR
	
申请快速通道是一个相对简单的过程。但是，您必须了解流程以确保您尽快获得加拿大永久居民的机会最大化。该过程可以分为六个步骤：	Applying for Express Entry is a relatively simple process. However, you must understand the process to ensure you maximize your chances of getting your Canada PR as soon as possible. The process can be broken down into six steps:

### 第 1 步：确保您满足要求。	Step 1: Ensure you Meet the Requirements.
	
每个 Express Entry 流都有其特定的要求。您可以在本文中找到这些流的完整分类。	Each of the Express Entry streams has its specific requirements. You can find a full breakdown of these streams in this article.
	
### 第 2 步：创建快速通道配置文件	Step 2: Create an Express Entry Profile
	
您创建一个 Express Entry 配置文件并输入上面的所有信息。此时，您需要提交所选省份的意向书。	You create an Express Entry profile and enter all the information above. At this point, you would submit your EOI for your chosen province.
	
### 第 3 步：接收 CRS 分数	Step 3: Receive a CRS Score
	
输入您的详细信息后，系统会计算您的分数并表示为满分 1200。如果您的 EOI 成功，您将获得最多 600 分以提高分数。	Once your details are entered, your score is calculated and represented out of 1200. If your EOI is successful, you will gain up to 600 points to improve your score.
	
### 第 4 步：获取申请邀请	Step 4: Get an Invitation to Apply
	
通过您的在线个人资料了解快速通道抽签的最新信息，看看您是否收到了 ITA。	Keep up to date with Express Entry draws via your online profile to see if you've received your ITA.
	
### 第 5 步：收集证明文件	Step 5: Collect Supporting Documents
	
收到 ITA 后，您有 60 天的时间提交所有必要的文件。这些文件包括：	Once you receive your ITA, you have 60 days to submit all necessary documents. These documents include:
	
*   护照	  Passport
* 国家职业分类 (NOC)	  National Occupation Classification (NOC)
* 教育学历评估报告	  Education credential assessment report

* 省提名（如果你有的话）	  Provincial Nomination (If you have one)
	
### 第 6 步：支付费用并提交 PR 申请	Step 6: Pay Your Fees and Submit Application for PR
	
您必须支付必要的永久居留费才能获得永久居留权。以下是所需费用的完整明细：	You must pay the necessary permanent residence fees to receive your permanent residence. Below is a full breakdown of the required fees:
	
|费用 | $加拿大 |	| Fees | $CAN |
| --- | --- |	| --- | --- |
|	| 
**你的申请**	**Your application**
	
手续费（850 美元）和永久居留权费（515 美元）	Processing fee ($850) and right of permanent residence fee ($515)
	
| 1,365 |	 | 1,365 |
| **您的申请（无需永久居留权费用）** | 850 |	| **Your application (without the right of permanent residence fee)** | 850 |
|	| 
	
**包括您的配偶或伴侣**	**Include your spouse or partner**
	
手续费（850 美元）和永久居留权费（515 美元）	Processing fee ($850) and right of permanent residence fee ($515)
	
| 1,365 |	 | 1,365 |

| **包括一个受抚养的孩子** | 230（每位儿童） |	| **Include a dependent child** | 230(per child) |
	
假设这是您的选择，并且您想确保您拥有尽快获得永久居留资格所需的一切。在这种情况下，我们建议您咨询经过认证的移民专家，例如加拿大注册移民顾问 (RCIC)。 RCIC 可以设置您的 Express Entry 资料，帮助您整理 EOI，填写申请表，帮助您获取和验证您的文件，根据加拿大标准整理您的简历，在某些移民当局代表您，跟踪您的申请一旦您提交并支持您完成**加拿大公关流程**的每一步。	Suppose this is your option, and you want to ensure you have everything you need to qualify for permanent residence as soon as possible. In that case, we recommend you speak to a certified immigration expert like a Registered Canadian Immigration Consultant (RCIC). An RCIC can set up your Express Entry profile, help you put together your EOI, fill out your application forms, help you acquire and verify your documents, curate your CV to Canadian standards, represent you with certain immigration authorities, keep track of your application once you've submitted it and support you with every step of your **Canada PR process**.

留学加拿大	Study in Canada
	
如果您不想永久留在加拿大或在您的工作假期签证到期前不符合加拿大永久居民的资格，您可能需要考虑其他临时选择。如果您想在工作假期后到加拿大学习，延长在加拿大逗留时间的绝佳方式是获得**加拿大学习许可**。	If you don't want to stay in Canada permanently or don't qualify for Canada PR before your Working Holiday Visa expires, you may want to look at additional temporary options. If you want to study in Canada after your working holiday, a fantastic way to extend your time in Canada is by gaining a **Canada study permit**.
	
加拿大拥有世界上一些最优质的教育，以及众多面向国际学生的优秀课程和学校。这是对加拿大教育系统的期望的一个更好的想法。	Canada has some of the highest quality education in the world and numerous fantastic programs and schools for international students. Here's a better idea of what to expect from Canada's education system.
	
获得学习许可的过程相对简单，但需要几个步骤。它们如下：	The process of gaining a study permit is relatively simple but requires several steps. They are as follows:
		
### 第 1 步：被加拿大大学录取	Step 1: Get Accepted to a Canadian University
	
在申请学习许可之前，您必须被加拿大指定学习机构 (DLI) 录取。 DLI是加拿大政府指定的招收国际学生的教育机构。最好的方法是直接联系您选择的大学或学院，并根据他们的标准进行申请。如果你被接受，你可以开始你的过程。以下是加拿大顶尖大学的列表，可帮助您入门。	Before applying for a study permit, you must be accepted by a Canadian Designated Learning Institution (DLI). A DLI is an educational institution designated by the Canadian government to admit international students. The best way to do this is by contacting the university or college of your choice directly and applying based on their criteria. If you're accepted, you may start your process. Here's a list of Canada's top universities to get you started. 
	
### 第二步：申请加拿大学习许可	Step 2: Apply for a Canada Study Permit
	
您可以通过加拿大政府网站或纸质文件在线申请学习许可。然而，在线申请要快得多，也容易得多。您需要随申请一起附上的文件如下：	You can apply for your study permit online via the Canadian government website or paper. Applying online, however, is far quicker and easier. The documents you will need to enclose with your application are as follows:
	
* 指定学习机构 (DLI) 的录取通知书	  An acceptance letter from a Designated Learning Institution (DLI)
* 有效护照或旅行证件	  A valid passport or travel document
* 证明您在加拿大期间可以在经济上支持自己	  Proof you can financially support yourself while in Canada
	
根据你来自哪个国家和你申请的大学，你可能还需要包括：	Depending on which country you're from and which university you're applying to, you may also need to include:
	
* 一封解释信	  A letter of explanation
* 魁北克接受证书 (CAQ)	  A certificat d’acceptation du Québec (CAQ)
* 保管人声明	  A custodian declaration
	
确保包含所需的一切至关重要，因为任何缺失的文件都可能导致申请处理出现严重延误。	It's vital to ensure that you include everything you need, as any missing documentation can cause significant delays in processing your application.
	
### 第 3 步：支付处理和生物识别费用	Step 3: Pay Processing and Biometric Fees
	
与任何签证或许可一样，您必须支付多项费用才能使您的申请被接受。它们如下：	As with any visa or permit, there are several fees you must pay for your application to be accepted. They are as follows:
	
|费用 | $加拿大 |	| Fees | $CAN |
| --- | --- |	| --- | --- |
| **学习许可（包括延期）——每人** | 150 |	| **Study permit (including extensions) – per person** | 150 |
|	| 
**恢复你的学生身份**	**Restore your status as a student**
	
恢复身份（$200）并获得新的学习许可（$150）	Restore your status ($200) and get a new study permit ($150)
	
| 350 |	 | 350 |
	
除此之外，根据您申请的国家/地区，您可能还必须提交生物识别信息（指纹和照片）才能获得**加拿大学习许可**。这些费用如下：	On top of this, depending on which country you're applying from, you may also have to submit your biometrics (fingerprints and photograph) to get your **Canada study permit**. The fees for these are as follows:
	
|费用 | $加拿大 |	| Fees | $CAN |
| --- | --- |	| --- | --- |
| **生物识别——每人** | 85 |	| **Biometrics – per person** | 85 |
|	| 
**生物识别——每个家庭（2 人或更多人）**	**Biometrics – per family (2 or more people)**
	
2 人或以上家庭同时申请的最高费用	Maximum fee for a family of 2 or more people applying at the same time and place
	
| 170 |	 | 170 |
|	| 
	
**生物识别——每组（3 名或更多表演艺术家）**	**Biometrics – per group (3 or more performing artists)**
	
3 名或更多表演艺术家在同一时间和地点申请的最高费用	Maximum fee for a group of 3 or more performing artists applying at the same time and place
	
| 255 |	 | 255 |
	
### 第 4 步：进行体检和无犯罪记录	Step 4: Do your Medical Exams & Police Clearance
	
获得专家组认证的医生需要进行全面的体检，以证明您身体健康，才能继续在加拿大逗留。您还需要接受警方背景调查，以确保您没有参与重大犯罪活动。	A panel-certified physician will need a complete medical exam to prove you're in physically good health to continue your stay in Canada. You will also need a police background check to ensure you haven't been involved in significant criminal activity.
	
### 第 5 步：等待您的申请结果	Step 5: Wait for Your Application Results
	
提交申请后，唯一要做的就是等待。 **加拿大学习许可**的一般等待时间约为 16 周。	Once your application is submitted, the only thing to do is wait. The general waiting time for a **Canada Study permit** is around 16 weeks.

在加拿大工作	Work in Canada
	
如果您不想学习，但仍想继续在加拿大生活和工作，**加拿大工作许可**可能是您的最佳选择。虽然申请是一个相对简单的过程，但它确实有您必须满足的特定要求。该过程可以分为三个主要步骤：	If you don't want to study but still want to continue to live and work in Canada, a **Canada work permit** may be the way for you. While applying is a relatively simple process, it does have particular requirements that you must fulfill. The process can be broken down into three primary steps:
	
### 第 1 步：选择您的加拿大工作许可	Step 1: Choose Your Canada Work Permit
	
有两种类型的工作许可证。它们如下：	There are two types of work permits. They are as follows:
	
#### 开放工签	Open Work Permit
	
您可以为加拿大的任何雇主工作。您不必通过劳动力市场影响评估 (LMIA) 证明您的雇主必须选择您而不是本地申请人。	You can work for any employer in Canada. You will not have to prove that your employer had to pick you over local applicants via a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA).
	
#### 封闭式或特定雇主工作许可	Closed or Employer-specific Work Permit
	
您可以作为外国人工作。不过，您必须在特定条件下和特定时间为特定雇主工作。这些更容易获得，但需要加拿大雇主提供工作机会。	You are allowed to work as a foreign national. Still, you must work for a specific employer, under specific conditions and for a specified time. These are far easier to get but require a job offer from a Canadian employer.
	
只有某些申请人将被允许使用开放式工作许可证工作，而大多数获得加拿大工作机会的人可能会获得封闭式工作许可证。为确保您可以获得工作许可，您必须执行以下操作，这将引导我们进入第二步。	Only certain applicants will be allowed to work with an open work permit, whereas most people with a Canadian job offer will likely gain a closed work permit. To ensure you can get a work permit, you must do the following, which leads us to step two.
	
### 第 2 步：检查您的资格	Step 2: Check Your Eligibility
	
要获得**加拿大工作许可**的资格，您必须执行以下操作：	To be eligible for a **Canada work permit,** you must do the following:
	
1. 证明您将在工作许可到期后离开加拿大；	1.  Prove you’ll leave Canada once your work permit expires;
2. 表明您可以在加拿大和回国期间为自己和任何家庭成员提供经济支持；	2.  Show you can financially support both yourself and any family members while in Canada and return home;
3.遵纪守法，无犯罪记录（无犯罪记录证明）；	3.  Obey the law and have no criminal record (as shown via a police clearance certificate);
4. 不会对加拿大的安全构成威胁；	4.  Not be a danger to Canada's security;
5. 身体健康（如体检所示）	5.  Be in good health (as shown via a medical exam)
6.不打算为不符合条件的用人单位名单上的用人单位工作；	6.  Not plan to work for an employer on the list of employers who failed to comply with the conditions;
7. 永远不要计划为定期提供脱衣舞、色情舞蹈、三陪服务或色情按摩的公司工作。	7.  Never plan to work for a company that regularly offers striptease, erotic dance, escort services, or erotic massages.
	
### 第三步：提交申请	Step 3: Submit the Application
	
如果您满足上述条件，您的工作许可申请可以在加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 网站上提交。	If you fulfill the above criteria, your work permit application can be submitted on the Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) website.
	
根据您所在的国家/地区，您可能需要提交 IRCC 指定的其他文件。在此处详细了解如何确保您获得加拿大工作许可。	Depending on your country, you may have to submit additional documents that the IRCC will specify. Learn more about how to ensure you get your Canadian work permit here.
	
在加拿大旅行	Travel in Canada
	
!在加拿大旅行	!Travel in Canada
	
如果您还没有完全准备好离开加拿大，但又不想在那里开始或建立新的职业，您可以获得加拿大旅游签证。持有旅游签证，您可以在打工度假签证到期后持旅游签证在加拿大停留六个月。但是，您将不允许持旅游签证工作。	If you’re not quite ready to let Canada go just yet, but don’t want to start or build a new career there, you can get a Canadian tourist visa. With a tourist visa, you can remain in Canada for six months with a tourist visa after your working holiday visa expires. However, you will not be allowed to work on a tourist visa.
	
该签证允许您在加拿大各地旅行，享受加拿大为外国客人提供的一切。在打工度假期间完成多项工作后，您可能想在加拿大宁静的荒野中放松身心，或享受因工作而错过的观光。	This visa allows you to travel throughout Canada and enjoy everything Canada has to offer foreign guests. After working many jobs on your Working Holiday, you may want to relax in Canada’s tranquil wilderness or enjoy the sightseeing you may have missed due to work.
	
这很容易获得，因为资格要求低于打工度假签证。你需要做的是：	This is very easy to get as the eligibility requirements are lower than a Working Holiday visa. What you need is to:
	
*身体健康	  Be in good health
* 持有护照等有效旅行证件	  Have a valid travel document like a passport
* 无犯罪记录	  Have no criminal record
* 与您的祖国有明确的联系，例如家庭或工作	  Have clear ties to your home country, like family or a job
* 证明您将在访问结束时离开加拿大。	  Prove you will leave Canada at the end of your visit.
* 有足够的资金来支付您在加拿大逗留期间的费用。	  Have enough funds to cover your expenses while you stay in Canada.
	
根据您所在的国家/地区，您可以在线申请或通过领事馆等签证办公室申请。在此处详细了解持旅游签证继续加拿大冒险所需的条件。	Depending on your country, you can apply online or via a visa office like a consulate. Learn more about what you need to continue your Canadian adventure with a tourist visa here.
