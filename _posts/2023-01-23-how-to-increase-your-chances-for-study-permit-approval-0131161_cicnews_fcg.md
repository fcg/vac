如何增加获得学习许可批准的机会 申请在加拿大学习的个人应注意资格标准、审查移民官的自由裁量权，以及如果他们的申请被拒绝，可以采取的后续步骤。	How to increase your chances for study permit approval Individuals applying to study in Canada should be mindful of the eligibility criteria, discretion of the reviewing immigration officer, and available next steps—should their application be refused.
	
加拿大仍然是世界上最受国际学生欢迎的目的地之一。凭借卓越的教育水平和国际认可的学校——加拿大每年接待大量来自国外的学生——仅在 2021 年就迎来了近 450,000 名国际新生。	Canada continues to be one of the world’s most popular destinations for international students. With an excellent standard of education and internationally accredited schools—Canada hosts a huge number of students from abroad every year—welcoming close to 450,000 new international students in 2021 alone.
	
虽然加拿大每年确实接待许多国际学生，但也有一些学生的学习许可申请被拒。仔细考虑加拿大移民难民和公民部 (IRCC) 设定的资格标准，以及 IRCC 移民官审查其申请的酌处权对于申请成功至关重要。	While Canada does host many international students annually, there are also those who receive refusals of their study permit applications. Giving careful consideration to the eligibility criteria set by Immigration Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), and the discretion of the IRCC immigration officer reviewing their application can be crucial to success when applying.

### 确保你符合条件	Make sure you are eligible
	
特别是，要获得学习许可，申请人必须满足资格标准。这包括申请人表明他们：	In particular, to receive a study permit, applicants must satisfy the eligibility criteria. This includes applicants showing that they:
	
* 已被指定学习机构 (DLI) 录取； DLI 是由省或地区政府授权接收国际学生的机构；	  Have been accepted to study at a Designated Learning Institution (DLI); a DLI is an institution that is authorized by a provincial or territorial government to host international students;
* 是守法公民，没有犯罪记录，不会对加拿大的安全构成威胁。可能还需要无犯罪记录证明；和	  Are a law-abiding citizen, with no criminal record, and not a risk to the security of Canada. A police clearance certificate(s) may be required as well; and
* 身体健康，并愿意在需要时完成体检。	  Are in good health and willing to complete a medical exam if needed.
	
但是，请理解接受或拒绝学习许可申请也受到审查移民官的自由裁量权的影响。	However, understand that acceptance or refusal of a study permit application is also influenced by the discretion of the reviewing immigration officer.
	
### 移民官的自由裁量权	Discretion of your immigration officer
	
向移民官员提供尽可能多的保证，确保申请人能够满足他们作为学生的逗留条件，这可能是成功的关键。	Giving immigration officers as much assurance as possible that an applicant can satisfy the terms of their stay as a student, can be pivotal to success.
	
除了不合格之外，申请被拒绝的原因有两个反复出现的主题（尽管确实存在其他主题）；涉及个人未能说服移民官员：	Outside of ineligibility, there are two recurring themes to why applications get refused (though others do exist); involving individuals failing to convince immigration officers that:
	
* 他们访问加拿大的实际目的是学习——在 2019 年至 2021 年期间，77% 的学习许可被拒是由于 IRCC 不满意申请人访问的目的是学习；和	  The actual purpose of their visit to Canada is to study—between 2019 and 2021, 77% of study permit refusals were due to IRCC not being satisfied that the purpose of the applicant’s visit was to study; and
* 他们将在逗留结束时离开加拿大——26% 的学习许可申请被拒（同期）是由于 IRCC 不满意申请人会根据其个人资产和财务状况离开加拿大。	  They will leave Canada at the end of their stay—26% of refusals of study permit applications (in the same time period) were due to IRCC not being satisfied that applicants would leave Canada based on their personal assets and financial status.
	
考虑到这一点，申请者应审查他们的申请是否尽可能清楚地显示。例如，如果申请人符合以下条件，则可能获得批准的机会更大：	With this consideration, individuals applying should review whether their applications show as clearly as possible. For example, applicants will likely have a better chance of approval if they:
	
* 确保他们在从以前的教育到正在接受的加拿大教育的研究中表现出清晰、合乎逻辑的进展；	  Make sure they show a clear, logical progression in studies from previous education to Canadian education being pursued;
* 确保他们可以通过授权文件出示财务证明；	  Make sure they can show proof of finances through authorized documentation;
* 确保他们符合英语/法语移民要求；	  Ensure they meet the English/French requirements for immigration;
* 解释他们在申请中的研究中的任何长期差距；	  Explain any long gaps in their studies in their application;
* 表明他们打算在学业结束后离开加拿大；	  Make evident their intent to leave Canada after the duration of their studies;
* 如果他们同时申请永久居留 (PR)，请确保他们完成双重意向申请。双重意图是指已经申请（或可能申请）PR 的外国人也申请以访客、工人或学生的身份临时进入加拿大；和	  Ensuring they complete a dual intent application if they have applied for permanent residence (PR) at the same time. Dual intent is when a foreign national who has applied (or may apply) for PR also applies to enter Canada for a temporary period as a visitor, worker, or student; and
* 在他们的申请中包括他们可以提供的任何其他文件/信息，以使审查他们的学习许可的官员有信心。	  Include any other documentation/information they can within their applications to give confidence to the officer reviewing their study permit.
	
此外，申请人可以查看他们可能有资格获得的学习许可流。例如，Student Direct Stream 是特定国家公民获得加拿大学习许可的优先途径。由于其较高的资格标准，此类别下的申请的录取率通常较高；被录取的申请人将受益于加快处理时间。	In addition, applicants can look at streams of study permits that they may be eligible for. For example, the Student Direct Stream is a preferential path to receive a Canadian study permit, for citizens of specific countries. Acceptance rates are generally higher for applications under this stream, due to its higher eligibility criteria; applicants accepted will benefit from expedited processing times.
	
### 如果您的申请被拒绝，接下来的步骤	Next steps if your application has been refused
	
虽然收到学习许可被拒可能令人沮丧，但申请人仍然可以采取措施继续在加拿大学习，甚至可以增加重新申请时被录取的机会。	While receiving a study permit refusal can be frustrating, applicants can still take steps to pursue studying in Canada, and even increase their chances of acceptance when re-applying.
	
申请人可以评估他们拒绝的原因是什么（包括在他们的拒绝信中），并相应地调整他们的申请。除非特别说明，否则 IRCC 没有申请之间的过渡期，因此申请人可以在准备好后立即重新申请。	Applicants can take stock of what the reasons for their refusal were (as included in their refusal letter), and adjust their applications accordingly. Unless specifically stated, IRCC does not have an interim period between applications, so applicants can re-apply as soon as they are ready.
	
最后，如果（基于拒签信中所述的原因），申请人怀疑自己被错误拒绝（并且他们确实符合资格标准），他们可以申请加拿大联邦法院对其决定进行复审.	Lastly, if (based on the reasons stated in the refusal letter), an applicant suspects that they have been refused wrongly (and that they do meet the eligibility criteria), they may apply for a review of their decision by the Federal Court of Canada.
