!IRCC 延长政策：访客可获得工作许可至 2025 年	!IRCC Extends Policy: Visitors Can Get Work Permits until 2025
	
加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 宣布延长一项临时公共政策，使在加拿大期间有工作机会的外国公民能够申请并获得工作许可。	Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) has announced the extension of a temporary public policy that enables foreign nationals who have an available job offer while in Canada to be able to apply for as well as receive a work permit.
	
该政策将持续到 2025 年 2 月 28 日。要符合资格，申请人必须在提交申请之日在该国拥有有效的访客身份，并获得劳动力市场影响评估 ( LMIA）或 LMIA 豁免，并满足所有其他常规的可接受性要求。	This policy will be in place until February 28, 2025. To qualify, applicants must have valid status in the country as a visitor on the day they submit the application, have an offer of employment that has been supported by a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) or is LMIA-exempt, and meet all other regular admissibility requirements.
	
## 加拿大工作许可政策更新	Canada’s Work Permit Policy Update
	
COVID-19 期间的临时公共政策原定于 2023 年 2 月 28 日终止，并已延长。该政策与加拿大的许多其他政策一样，鼓励移民进入并留在加拿大以加入劳动力市场。	The temporary public policy from the COVID-19 period was scheduled to terminate on 28 February 2023 and has been extended. This policy joins Canada’s many others that encourage immigrants to enter and remain in Canada in order to join the labour market.
	
任何在加拿大并获得工作机会的外国访客都有资格申请并获得工作许可。该政策将持续到 2025 年 2 月。	Any foreign visitor who is in Canada and gets an employment offer is eligible to file for and be granted a work permit. This policy is set to run until February 2025.
	
在政策变更之前，申请人通常需要在进入加拿大之前获得工作许可。为了在加拿大以旅游身份获得工作许可，他们别无选择，只能离开并重新进入加拿大。该政策的修正案完全取消了这一步骤——使那些希望在加拿大旅行或居住的人更容易。	Prior to the policy alteration, applicants typically needed to obtain a work permit before entering Canada. To receive their work permit while in Canada with tourist status, they had no choice but to leave and re-enter the nation. An amendment of this policy has eliminated that step entirely - making it much easier for those wishing to travel or live in Canada.
	
当与 COVID 相关的旅行限制到位且新移民难以从海外进入该国时，该措施最初是为了帮助加拿大雇主填补紧急劳动力短缺而推出的。	When COVID-related travel restrictions were in place and it was difficult for newcomers to enter the country from overseas, the measure was originally introduced to assist employers in Canada fill urgent labor shortages.
	
## 申请要求	Requirements to Apply
	
为了考虑这项临时国家政策，候选人必须：	In order to be considered for this temporary state policy, a candidate must:
	
- 拥有一份由劳动力市场影响评估 (LMIA) 或 LMIA 豁免工作提供支持的工作机会。	-   Have a job offer that is backed by a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) or an LMIA-exempt offer of employment.
- 在申请之日在加拿大拥有合法访客身份。	-   Have legal visitor status in Canada on the day they apply.
- 必须在 2025 年 2 月 28 日之前提交特定雇主工作许可申请。	-   Must Submit applications for employer-specific work permits by February 28, 2025.
- 满足所有其他正常的录取标准，例如语言要求	-   Satisfy every other normal criterion for admissibility such as language requirements
	
合法的工作机会必须符合加拿大移民当局考虑的几个标准。这包括书面全职、非季节性职位，工作时间为一年或更长时间；雇主还必须从加拿大就业和社会发展部 (ESDC) 获得积极或什至中立的劳动力市场影响评估 (LMIA)。此外，LMIA 豁免也是一个可接受的替代方案。	A legitimate job offer must meet several criteria to be considered by Canadian immigration authorities. This includes being a written full-time, non-seasonal position with a one-year or longer duration of employment; the employer must also receive either a positive or even neutral Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) from Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC). Additionally, a LMIA exemption is an acceptable alternative as well.
	
如果您是希望雇用外国工人的雇主，那么申请这份重要文件是必不可少的。 ESDC 将检查您的决定对加拿大经济的影响，包括它是否会产生积极、中性或消极的后果。如果他们评估这在任何方面都是有害的，那么不幸的是，您将没有资格雇用外国人。	Applying for this important document is essential if you're an employer hoping to hire foreign workers. ESDC will examine the impact of your decision on the Canadian economy, including whether or not it will have positive, neutral or negative consequences. If they assess that it'll be detrimental in any way, then unfortunately, you won't be eligible to employ foreign nationals.
	
## 访客更改	Changes For Visitors
	
任何在加拿大拥有访客身份但在去年获得工作许可但目前没有工作许可的人都可以按照特殊说明获得临时工作许可，甚至在他们的工作许可申请获得批准之前就开始为新雇主工作，以增加劳动力在加拿大。	Anyone in Canada with visitor status who had a work permit in the last year but does not presently have one can follow special instructions to obtain temporary work authorization to start working for their new employer even before their work permit application is approved to increase the labour force in Canada.
