# 移民女性在加拿大劳动力中的表现如何？加拿大仍在努力缩小工资差距并提高移民妇女的工作质量。	How are immigrant women faring in Canada’s workforce? Canada is still trying to close the wage gap and improve the quality of work for immigrant women.
国际妇女节定于每年的 3 月 8 日，以表彰女性在工作场所所做的贡献、她们在家庭中所做的工作以及她们在文化和社会方面的贡献。这也是一个让人们意识到全球女性面临的许多持续斗争的日子。	International Women’s Day takes place annually on March 8th as a global recognition of the contributions that women make in the workplace, the work they do in the home as well as their cultural and societal contributions. It also acts as a day to bring awareness to many of the ongoing struggles women face globally.
	
加拿大作为一个进步的国家享有盛誉，拥有强有力的人权立法和对人人平等的承诺。一般来说，加拿大女性享有与男性相同的所有权利和自由，但在女性，尤其是新移民女性在加拿大劳动力中的代表性方面仍然存在一些显着差距。	Canada has a reputation as a progressive country with strong human rights legislation and a commitment to equality for all. Generally, women in Canada have all the same rights and freedoms as men, but there are still some significant gaps in how women, particularly newcomer women, are represented in Canada’s workforce.
	
### 在加拿大工作的移民妇女	Immigrant women working in Canada
	
加拿大统计局 2022 年的数据显示，劳动力市场上有 4,200,630 名移民妇女。其中，290 万是有色人种，130 万不是。总体而言，移民对加拿大劳动力增长的近 100% 和加拿大人口增长的 75% 负有责任。	Statistics Canada data from 2022 shows there were 4,200,630 immigrant women in the labour market. Of these, 2.9 million were visible minorities while 1.3 million were not. Overall, immigrants are responsible for almost 100% of Canada’s labour force growth and 75% of Canada’s population growth.
	
根据加拿大统计局的数据，女性在全国劳动力中的参与率为 83%。这表明与 1976 年相比增加了 30% 以上，当时只有一半的加拿大妇女外出工作。男性劳动力市场参与率目前为 91.5%。	According to Statistics Canada, women have an 83% participation rate in the national workforce. This shows an increase of over 30% from 1976 when only half of the women in Canada worked outside the home. The male labour market participation rate is currently 91.5%.
	
2021 年 1 月至 6 月的劳动力调查数据显示，新移民女性与加拿大出生女性之间存在显着的失业率差距（15.2% 对 8.0%）。此外，在就业移民妇女中，特别是种族化妇女，她们就业的部门往往工资率相对较低。	Labour Force Survey data from January to June 2021 shows that there is a notable unemployment gap between recent immigrant women and Canadian-born women (15.2% vs. 8.0%). Further, among employed immigrant women, particularly racialized women, the sectors in which they are employed tend to have comparatively lower rates of pay.
	
去年，加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 报告称，有种族歧视的新移民女性在住宿和食品服务或酒店等低薪行业的人数过多。这些行业在 COVID-19 期间受到劳动力市场损失的严重影响。许多新移民女性在加拿大的这些行业开始了她们的职业生涯，并经历了一些最严重的工资损失。 2019 年至 2020 年间，移民女性的入职工资中位数下降了 11.1%，从 26,100 美元降至 23,200 美元。	Last year, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) reported that racialized newcomer women are overrepresented in low-wage sectors, such as accommodation and food services or hospitality. These industries were heavily impacted by labour market losses during COVID-19. Many newcomer women start their careers in Canada in these industries and experienced some of the most dramatic wage losses. Between 2019 and 2020, the median entry wage of immigrant women fell by 11.1%, from $26,100 to $23,200.
	
此外，最近一项关于移民女性在行政职位上的作用的研究发现，大约四分之一的高管是女性，其中大约七分之一是移民女性。该研究还发现，在高管移民女性中，该女性出生在美国或英国的可能性是后者的四倍。	Further, a recent study about the role of immigrant women in executive positions found that about one in four executives were women, and of these, roughly one in seven were immigrant women. The study also found that among executive immigrant women, it was four times more likely that the woman was born in the United States or the United Kingdom.
	
在移民和加拿大出生的高管中，移民女性的就业收入中位数最低，为 241,900 美元，性别薪酬差距最大，为 29%。	Among immigrant and Canadian-born executives, immigrant women earned the lowest median employment income, at $241,900, and encountered the greatest gender pay gap, at 29%.
	
### 大多数移民妇女通过家庭班级赞助到达	Majority of immigrant women arrive through family class sponsorship
	
2022 年，有 1,215,200 名女性移民作为经济移民计划的副申请人抵达加拿大，这意味着她们是通过经济移民计划申请移民加拿大的人的配偶、伴侣或受抚养人。另有 1,194,685 人通过家庭班赞助抵达。	In 2022, 1,215,200 women immigrants arrived in Canada as secondary applicants in an economic immigration program, meaning they were a spouse, partner or dependent of someone who applied to immigrate to Canada through an economic immigration program. A further 1,194,685 arrived through family class sponsorship.
	
在去年被加拿大录取的经济主申请人总数中，有620,885人是女性。经济移民计划的目标候选人是具有紧缺技能和经验的候选人，这将使他们能够轻松融入并为经济做出贡献。相比之下，超过 930,000 名男性通过其中一个项目获得录取。	Among the total number of economic principal applicants who were admitted to Canada last year, 620,885 were women. Economic immigration programs target candidates with in-demand skills and experience that will allow them to integrate easily and contribute to the economy. In contrast, over 930,000 men gained admittance through one of these programs.
	
数据显示，66% 的已婚或同居移民女性（因此更有可能通过家庭类赞助计划移民）可能从事全职工作，而在加拿大出生的女性中这一比例为 70%。	Data shows 66% of immigrant women who are married or in common law relationships (therefore more likely to have immigrated through family class sponsorship programs) are likely to work full-time, compared to 70% of Canadian-born women.
	
### 加拿大女性的薪酬差距	Pay gap for women in Canada
	
自 100 多年前第一次世界大战以来，加拿大女性一直活跃在加拿大的劳动力队伍中，但她们的收入与男性同事之间仍然存在差距。加拿大妇女基金会报告称，平均而言，男性每赚 1 美元，加拿大女性赚 89 美分。这没有考虑到新移民和新移民与加拿大出生的女性之间存在的差距。	Canadian women have been active in Canada’s workforce since the first World War, over 100 years ago, but there is still a gap between their incomes and that of their male colleagues. The Canadian Women’s Foundation reports that, on average, women in Canada make 89 cents for every dollar a man makes. This does not take into account the gap that exists between new and recent immigrants and Canadian-born women.
	
加拿大统计局 2019 年的数据显示，新移民和新移民女性的周收入比加拿大出生的女性低 20% 以上。长期移民的差距略微缩小至 4.7%。	Statistics Canada data from 2019 reported that new and recent immigrant women made over 20% less in weekly earnings than Canadian-born women. The gap narrowed somewhat to 4.7% less for long-term immigrants.
	
2021 年人口普查数据显示，一旦收入阶层每年超过 60,000 美元，收入领取者的数量在女性中会急剧减少，而在男性中会增加。例如，加拿大有 1,109,610 名男性和 487,185 名女性报告个人税后收入超过 100,000 美元。	Census 2021 data shows that once the income bracket gets higher than $60,000 a year, the number of income recipients decreases dramatically among women and increases in men. For example, there are 1,109,610 men and 487,185 women reporting individual incomes of over $100,000 after tax in Canada.
	
### 加拿大为缩小差距所做的努力	Canada’s effort to close the gap
	
2021 年 8 月，联邦政府实施了《薪酬公平法》，以缩小工资差距并确保为女性提供公平的报酬。但是，这仅适用于受雇于联邦监管工作场所的女性。	In August 2021, the federal government implemented the Pay Equity Act to close the wage gap and ensure fair compensation for women. However, this only applies to women who are employed in federally regulated workplaces.
	
一些省份制定了旨在确保女性同工同酬的立法。例如，不列颠哥伦比亚省、艾伯塔省、安大略省和萨斯喀彻温省的人权立法禁止基于性别的薪酬歧视。此外，同工同酬是安大略省、曼尼托巴省、萨斯喀彻温省、育空地区、纽芬兰和西北地区就业标准立法的要求。	Some provinces have legislation that aims to ensure equal pay for women. For example, pay discrimination on the grounds of gender is prohibited by Human Rights legislation in British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario, Saskatchewan. Additionally, equal pay for the same or similar work is a requirement of employment standards legislation in Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Yukon, Newfoundland, and Northwest Territories.
	
为了应对种族化移民妇女收入较低的问题，政府最近承诺为种族化新移民女性试点计划下的项目提供近 600 万美元的额外资金。试点项目的参与者可以获得定居服务，这些服务有助于培养软技能以帮助他们找到工作，例如制作简历。然而，大部分资金都用于协助防止性别暴力的项目。	In response to lower incomes among racialized immigrant women, the government has recently committed nearly $6 million in additional funding for programs under the Racialized Newcomer Women Pilot Program. Participants in the Pilot have access to settlement services that help with developing soft skills to help them find employment, such as creating resumes. However, much of the funding goes toward projects to assist initiatives preventing gender-based violence.
