# 加拿大人如何庆祝洒红节？加拿大的印度教徒今年将有充足的机会庆祝洒红节。	How do Canadians celebrate Holi? Hindus in Canada will have ample opportunity to celebrate Holi this year.
今天是充满庆祝活动的一天：生动的色彩、响亮的笑声，以及与朋友和家人共度的时光。	Today marks a day filled with festivities: lively colours, ringing laughter, and time with friends and family.
	
今年的 3 月 8 日是印度教的色彩节日胡里节。纪念正义战胜邪恶、春天的到来和爱情的绽放——洒红节今天不仅在印度（大多数印度教徒居住的地方）庆祝，而且通过散居在世界各地的印度教徒庆祝。	This year, March 8th is Holi, the Hindu festival of colours. Commemorating the triumph of good over evil, the arrival of spring, and the blossoming of love—Holi is celebrated today not just in India (where the majority of Hindus live), but across the world through the Hindu diaspora.
	
胡里节以其充满活力的庆祝活动而广为人知，其标志是亲人会面、泼彩粉和水（通常在街道或公共场所）、点燃篝火、演奏节日音乐等等。这个节日被视为新的开始、忏悔、宽恕自己的错误以及和解分歧的一天。	Largely known by its vibrant celebrations, the festival of Holi is marked by the meeting of loved ones, the throwing of coloured powder and water (usually in streets or public places), the lighting of bonfires, the playing of festive music and much more. The festival is seen as a day of new beginnings, repentance, forgiveness for one’s mistakes, and the reconciliation of differences.
	
### 加拿大人如何庆祝洒红节？	How do Canadians celebrate Holi?
	
加拿大庆祝洒红节的方式与印度和其他印度教人口众多的国家大致相同。虽然庆祝活动可能不是主流，但在加拿大仍然以极大的热情（并且通常有不同种族的人群）庆祝这个节日。	Holi in Canada is celebrated in much the same way as in India, and other countries with prominent Hindu populations. While celebrations may not be as mainstream, the festival is still observed with great enthusiasm (and often with an ethnically diverse crowd) in Canada.
	
通常，加拿大的胡里节庆祝活动是由当地的印度教社区、学校组织、私人活动组织者，甚至相关市政府组织的。	Usually, Holi celebrations in Canada are organized by a local Hindu community, a school organization, a private event organizer, or even the relevant municipal government.
	
例如，仅大多伦多地区 (GTA) 就为今天的庆祝活动提供了多种选择，还有更多选择被推迟到周末。学生会在这方面特别活跃，麦克马斯特大学、谢里登学院和安大略艺术与设计学院等知名学校今年通过其印度教学生社团或学生会举办了各种活动。	For example, the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) alone has a number of options available for today’s celebration, with many more being deferred to the weekend. Student Unions are particularly active in this regard, with distinguished schools like McMaster, Sheridan College, and the Ontario College of Arts and Design hosting various events this year, through their Hindu student societies, or Student Unions.
	
类似的活动在加拿大各地随处可见，尤其是在像蒙特利尔或温哥华这样有大量新移民的人口中心。	Similar events can be found throughout Canada, especially in population centers with a large number of newcomers like Montreal or Vancouver.

### 印第安人是加拿大最大的新移民群体	Indians make up Canada’s largest group of newcomers
	
洒红节在加拿大的流行在很大程度上归功于该国庞大的印度移民人口。	The popularity of Holi in Canada is due, in no small part, to the country’s large Indian immigrant population.
	
2021 年，[130 万人报告拥有印度血统](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/221026/dq221026b-eng.htm#:~:text=Indian%20(来自%20India)%22%20(1.3%C2%A0million)%20and%20%22Filipino%22%20(0.9%C2%A0million)%20were%20also%20among%20the%20ethnic%20or%20cultural%20origins%20reported% 20most%20often.)，约占加拿大人口的 3.3%。	In 2021, [1.3 million people reported being of Indian heritage](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/221026/dq221026b-eng.htm#:~:text=Indian%20(from%20India)%22%20(1.3%C2%A0million)%20and%20%22Filipino%22%20(0.9%C2%A0million)%20were%20also%20among%20the%20ethnic%20or%20cultural%20origins%20reported%20most%20often.), comprising roughly 3.3% of Canada’s population.
	
然而，同年，印度是新永久居民的最大出生国（占抵达加拿大的所有移民的 18%）。 2022年，印度也是加拿大新公民最常见的原籍国。由于其受过良好教育的劳动力和具有紧缺技能的专业人士，印度是加拿大持续移民计划的重要组成部分——不仅为该国带来经济，还带来社会和文化利益。	In the same year, however, India was the top country of birth for new permanent residents (comprising 18% of all immigrants arriving in Canada). In 2022, India was also the most common country of origin for new Canadian citizens. Due to its educated workforce and professionals with in-demand skills, India is a huge part of Canada’s continuing immigration initiatives—bringing not just economic, but also social and cultural benefit to the country.
	
随着移民人数不断增加，印度社区在加拿大各地不断壮大，洒红节（和其他印度教节日）似乎将继续在加拿大文化中占有重要地位。	As immigration levels continue to increase, and Indian communities grow throughout Canada, it seems likely that Holi (and other Hindu festivals) will continue to feature prominently in Canadian culture.
	
### 自由和多元文化主义的作用	The role of freedom and multiculturalism
	
印度教徒可以在加拿大自由庆祝洒红节，因为加拿大的《权利和自由宪章》及其多元文化主义政策规定了宗教特权的权利。	Hindus are free to celebrate Holi in Canada, because of the right to religious privileges outlined in Canada’s Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and its policy of multiculturalism.
	
《加拿大权利和保护宪章》第二节允许加拿大人有权信奉他们想要的任何宗教（或根本不信教）。这项权利不仅适用于所有宗教和族裔群体，还适用于临时居民（如学习和工作许可证持有人）——这意味着加拿大的任何人都享有这些权利。	Section two of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Protections allows Canadians the right to follow any religion that they want (or no religion at all). This right is not just extended to all religions and ethnic groups, but also to temporary residents (like study and work permit holders)—meaning anyone in Canada is afforded these rights.
	
除了这些正式规定的自由之外，加拿大还拥有多元文化主义文化。实际上，多元文化主义意味着加拿大的任何人都可以根据他们的文化、社会和种族传统自由地继续实践他们的文化——确保新移民不需要融入一种中心文化。	Outside of these formally enshrined freedoms, Canada also has a culture of multiculturalism. Effectively, multiculturalism means that anyone in Canada is free to continue practicing their culture, in accordance with their cultural, social, and ethnic heritage—ensuring that newcomers are not required to assimilate to one central culture.
	
这项政策使加拿大能够欢迎和融合来自不同背景的人。作为一个社会，加拿大拥抱文化多样性，使得像胡里节这样的节日（以及纪念这一天的许多活动）能够在加拿大举行，没有复杂化或障碍，并有自由和尊重。	This policy allows Canada to welcome and integrate people from widely different backgrounds. As a society, Canada embraces cultural diversity, enabling festivals like Holi (and the many events that commemorate the day) to occur in Canada without complication or hindrance, and with freedom and respect.
