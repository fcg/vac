!加拿大建筑工人的光明未来	!Brighter Future for Construction Workers In Canada
	
加拿大宣布将把大多伦多地区的无身份建筑工人的移民计划增加一倍。此举旨在解决建筑行业熟练劳动力短缺的问题，并帮助这些工人在加拿大获得合法身份。	Canada has announced that it will be doubling its immigration program for out-of-status construction workers in the Greater Toronto Area. This move is aimed at addressing the shortage of skilled labour in the construction industry and helping these workers gain legal status in Canada.
	
建筑工人计划	The Construction Workers Program
	
该计划称为“建筑工人计划”，于 2019 年启动，允许大多伦多地区的无身份建筑工人申请工作许可证并最终获得永久居留权。该计划已成功地为许多工人提供了获得合法身份的途径，政府已决定扩大该计划以满足建筑行业对熟练劳动力不断增长的需求。	The program called the "Construction Workers Program," was launched in 2019 and allows out-of-status construction workers in the Greater Toronto Area to apply for a work permit and eventually permanent residency. The program has been successful in providing a pathway to legal status for many workers, and the government has decided to expand it to meet the growing demand for skilled labour in the construction industry.
	
> “这对建筑业和工人来说都是双赢的局面，”移民、难民和公民部部长说。 “这些工人多年来一直为建筑业做出贡献，现在他们有机会获得合法身份，继续为加拿大经济做出贡献。”	> "This is a win-win situation for both the construction industry and the workers," said the Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship. "These workers have been contributing to the construction industry for years, and now they have a chance to gain legal status and continue to contribute to the Canadian economy."
	
该计划的扩展预计将使成千上万的工人及其家人以及大多伦多地区的建筑业受益。政府将与行业利益相关者密切合作，以确保该计划的顺利实施。	The expansion of the program is expected to benefit thousands of workers and their families, as well as the construction industry in the Greater Toronto Area. The government will be working closely with industry stakeholders to ensure a smooth implementation of the program.
	
为什么这个项目很重要	Why This Program Matters
	
该计划承认建筑工人在塑造和发展加拿大城市中发挥的重要作用，并为他们和他们的家人提供永久居留权的机会，使他们能够长期留在加拿大。该计划是为解决加拿大劳动力短缺问题而实施的几项新举措的一部分，这些举措通过引进和留住推动经济增长和建设国家社区所需的工人来解决。	This program recognizes the vital role that construction workers play in shaping and developing Canada’s cities and provides them and their families with an opportunity for permanent residency, allowing them to stay in Canada long-term. This program is part of several new initiatives implemented to address labour shortages in Canada by bringing in and retaining the workers needed to drive economic growth and build the country’s communities.
	
该计划促进了更加稳定的建筑业，并保证加拿大的技术工人将继续满足住房开发的关键需求。此外，它将有助于将更多的工人带出非正规经济，这将有利于加拿大著名的计划和服务，例如加拿大儿童福利、老年保障和就业保险。	The program promotes a more stable construction industry and guarantees that skilled workers in Canada will continue to meet the critical needs of housing development. Additionally, it will assist in bringing a larger number of workers out of the informal economy, which will benefit Canada's renowned programs and services such as the Canada Child Benefit, Old Age Security and Employment Insurance.
	
符合此计划资格的个人必须在 2024 年 1 月 2 日之前提交永久居留申请。他们还可以选择将他们的配偶、伴侣和受抚养子女包括在他们的申请中。申请该计划的过程包括将他们的名字提交给建筑劳资关系部 (CLR)，后者将评估他们的资格，然后将他们的申请转发给加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 进行进一步处理。这将确保只有符合条件的个人才能申请永久居留权，并确保流程简化和高效。	Individuals who are qualified for this program have until January 2, 2024, to submit their application for permanent residence. They also have the option to include their spouses, partners and dependent children in their application. The process for applying for the program includes submitting their names to the Construction Labour Relations (CLR), who will evaluate their eligibility and then forward their application to the Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) for further processing. This will ensure that only eligible individuals are able to apply for permanent residence, and that the process is streamlined and efficient.
	
这对潜在移民意味着什么？	What Does This Mean for Potential Immigrants?
	
该计划为大多伦多地区失去身份的建筑工人提供了申请工作许可并最终获得永久居留权的途径。这意味着目前在 GTA 的建筑行业工作但在加拿大没有合法身份的符合条件的个人将有机会通过成为建筑工人获得永久居留权，并继续为加拿大经济做出贡献。	This program offers a pathway for out-of-status construction workers in the Greater Toronto Area to apply for a work permit and, eventually, permanent residency. This means that eligible individuals who are currently working in the construction industry in the GTA, but do not have legal status in Canada, will have an opportunity to gain permanent residency through being a construction worker and continue to contribute to the Canadian economy.
