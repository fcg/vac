2023 年开始对 Express Entry 计划进行一些更改！使用它的新权限；加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 将举行快速通道抽签，根据具体方面邀请候选人，而不仅仅是他们的综合排名系统 (CRS) 分数。	2023 is commencing with some changes to the Express Entry program! Using it’s new authorities; Immigration, Refugee and Citizenship Canada(IRCC) will hold Express Entry draws that invite candidates based on specific aspects instead of just their Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) score.
	
**快速通道及其运作方式！ Express Entry and How it Operates!**
	
快速通道系统提供了一种更快的方式来处理根据三个经济移民计划申请的技术工人。这三个程序是：	The Express Entry system provides a faster way to process skilled workers who apply under three economic immigration programs. These three programs are:
	
* 联邦技术计划 (FSWP)	  Federal Skilled Program (FSWP)
* 联邦技术贸易计划 (FSTP) 和	  Federal Skilled Trades Program (FSTP) and
* 加拿大经验类 (CEC)	  Canadian Experience Class (CEC)
	
这些是您需要了解的三个选项。	These are the three options you need to know about.
	
自 Express Entry 于 2015 年 1 月开始使用综合排名系统 (CRS) 以来，候选人将完全根据他们的分数来选择接受 ITA。CRS 根据工作经验、教育和其他人力资本因素（例如他们的年龄以及是否他们）来评估候选人有家人住在加拿大。每个因素都被分配了分数，分数最高的候选人将被选中。因此，得分最高的候选人将有更高的机会在快速通道抽签中获得 ITA。	Since Express Entry started using the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) in January 2015, candidates are selected to receive ITAs exclusively based on their score.The CRS evaluates a candidate based on work experience, education and other human capital factors like their age and if they have family living in Canada. Each factor is assigned points and the candidate with the most points is the one that would be selected. Therefore, the candidate with the most points will have a higher chance of receiving an ITA in an Express Entry draw.
	
由于 C-19 法案于 6 月 23 日在议会两院获得通过，这些预期的计划变更即将通过。该法案赋予移民部长邀请任何具有任何需求技能的候选人的权力。据移民部长称，该计划的变化将有助于加拿大选择为经济成功做好准备的移民；尽管加拿大在竞争中已经领先，但仍有改进的空间。	As a result of Bill C-19, which was passed in both houses of parliament on June 23rd, these anticipated changes to the program are coming to pass. This Bill gives the immigration minister the power to invite any candidates with any in-demand skills. According to the Immigration minister, the changes to the program will assist Canada in selecting immigrants who are prepared for economic success; though Canada is already competitively ahead, there is still room for improvement.

根据部长的说法，目前，如果经济面临未来可能面临的特殊挑战，快速入境系统可能会得到改善。 Express Entry 系统不允许他们自定义邀请来申请满足那些急需的资格和技能。	As per the minister, At present, the Express Entry system could be improved if the economy is facing particular challenges that may be faced in the future. The Express Entry system does not allow them to customize invitations to apply to meet those in-demand qualifications and skills.
	
IRCC 表示，该法案将允许加拿大在新的基础上邀请快速通道候选人，该基础将支持部长确定的经济目标。让我们来看看谁将被邀请	IRCC says that the Bill will allow Canada to invite Express Entry candidates on a new basis, one that would support an economic goal identified by the minister. Let’s look a bit into who will be invited
