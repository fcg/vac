越来越多的加拿大人表示法语是他们的第一官方语言，但讲法语的加拿大人所占比例从 2016 年 (22.2%) 下降到 2022 年 (21.4)。 2019 年，IRCC 在《实现我们的目标：法语移民战略》一书中宣布了到 2023 年魁北克以外的法语移民达到 4.4% 的目标。	A growing number of Canadians report that French is their first official language, but the proportion that French speaking Canadians represents dropped from 2016 (22.2%) to 2022 (21.4). In 2019, IRCC announced the goal of 4.4% of French-speaking immigrants outside Quebec by 2023 in the “Meeting our Objectives: Francophone Immigration Strategy” publication.
	
1 月 23 日，加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 部长 Sean Fraser 阁下与部长政务秘书 Marie-France Lalonde 和官方语言部长政务秘书 Marc G. Serré 宣布Sturgeon Falls 表示，加拿大已在 2022 年实现了 4.4% 的目标。	On January 23rd, the Honorable Sean Fraser, the Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) along with Marie-France Lalonde, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister, and Marc G. Serré, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Official Languages announced in Sturgeon Falls that Canada has achieved the 4.4% target in 2022.
	
2022年，加拿大迎来了自2006年以来最多的法语新移民。2006年，魁北克以外的法语居民人数刚刚超过2800人，占移民总数的1.38%。过去一年，超过16,300名新移民定居在加拿大各地的法语少数民族，比2006年增加了3.02%，这是自加拿大开始记录移民数据以来，魁北克省以外的法语移民人数最多的一次。	In 2022, Canada welcomed the highest number of francophone newcomers since 2006. The number of Francophone residents outside Quebec was just over 2,800 in 2006, making up 1.38% of immigrants. Over the past year, more than 16,300 new immigrants settled in francophone minorities across Canada, representing a jump of 3.02% since 2006. This is the largest number of French speaking immigrants outside of Quebec since Canada began to record immigration data.
	
过去5年，法语区移民人口增加了42,470名永久居民，移民数量逐年上升。因此，加拿大不仅达到了他们的目标，而且自2018年以来还迎来了三倍多的移民。	Over the past 5 years, the Francophone immigrant population has increased by 42,470 permanent residents, with immigration levels rising each year. Therefore, not only has Canada reached their target, but it has also welcomed more than three times the number of immigrants since 2018.
