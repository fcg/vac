!如何从埃及移民到加拿大	!How to Immigrate to Canada From Egypt
	
作为埃及人，您是否想过用埃及的炎热换取更舒适、更凉爽的环境？您是否考虑过在您的工作生活中抓住下一个机会，但在您的祖国无法实现？	As an Egyptian, have you ever thought about swapping the heat of Egypt for a more cozy, chill environment? Have you thought about seizing the next opportunity in your working life but are unable to in your home country?
	
或者你只是想改变一下节奏，在一个与你习惯的环境截然不同的新地方重新开始？如果是这样，那么我们建议移居加拿大作为实现所有这些愿望的目的地。	Or do you simply want a change of pace, a new start in a new place that is very different from the environment that you’re used to? If so, then we recommend moving to Canada as the destination to fulfill all these wishes.
	
为什么要从埃及移居加拿大？	Why Move to Canada From Egypt?
	
！	!
	
加拿大以其对移民的积极态度而闻名，超过五分之一的加拿大公民来自另一个国家。大约有 100,000 名埃及人居住在加拿大，其中大部分人定居在魁北克和安大略省，但还有许多其他美妙的城市和省份可供探索，所有这些城市和省份都有很多机会。	Canada is well known for its positive stance on immigration, with more than 1 in 5 Canadian Citizens originating from another country. Approximately 100,000 Egyptians are living in Canada, most of whom have settled in Quebec and Ontario but there are so many other wonderful cities and provinces to explore, all with great opportunities.
	
然而，加拿大的劳动力受到关键经济部门缺乏熟练和有经验的工人的影响，这促使政府设计新的和简化现有的移民计划，以帮助外国人在加拿大找到工作并更快、更容易地获得永久居留权比以往任何时候都。	Canada’s workforce, however, has been affected by a lack of skilled and experienced workers in key sectors of the economy, which has encouraged the Government to design new and streamline existing immigration programs to help foreigners find jobs in Canada and get permanent residency quicker and easier than ever before.
	
加拿大人提前退休，年轻的专业人士正搬到城市中心寻找新机会，导致关键职位空缺。但是，通过快速入境系统等加拿大移民计划，移民比以往任何时候都更快、更容易地找到了前往加拿大的途径。让我们来看看如何加入他们。	Canadians are retiring earlier and young professionals are moving to urban hubs in search of new opportunities, leaving key positions unfilled. But with Canadian immigration programs such as the Express Entry system, immigrants are finding their way to Canada faster and easier than ever before. Let’s take a look at how you can join them.
	
从埃及移民到加拿大的两个最佳程序？	The Two Best Programs To Use To Immigrate To Canada From Egypt?
	
！	!
	
### 快速通道系统	Express Entry System
	
快速通道系统不仅是申请加拿大永久居留权的最有效方式。它的在线申请流程使全球各地的人们都能轻松获得，并有助于将处理时间缩短至 6 个月。这比邮寄申请要快得多，邮寄申请可能需要 12 到 18 个月的时间。	The Express Entry system is not only the most efficient way to apply for permanent residence in Canada. Its online application process makes it easily available to people all across the globe and helps reduce processing times to as little as 6 months. This is a lot quicker than applying by mail which can take anywhere between 12 - 18 months.
	
快速通道系统帮助各种技能水平的熟练外国工人帮助发展加拿大经济，找到移民加拿大的途径。快速通道系统管理着三个联邦经济项目。	The Express Entry system helps skilled foreign workers of all skill levels who can help grow Canada’s economy, find immigration pathways to Canada. The Express Entry system manages three federal economic programs.
	
* 联邦技术工人计划	  Federal Skilled Worker Programs
	
* 联邦技工项目	  Federal Skilled Trades Programs
	
* 加拿大体验班	  Canadian Experience Class
	
第一步是根据以下因素确定您是否符合条件：	The first step will be to determine if you are eligible based on factors such as:
	
*   年龄	  Age
	
* 语言能力	  Language abilities
	
* 工作经验（如有）	  Work experience (if any)
	
*   教育	  Education
	
* 能够成功融入加拿大生活	  Ability to settle into Canadian life successfully
	
	Once you know that you’re eligible you will have to create an online profile. Your profile will then be entered into Express Entry draws.
	
这些抽奖通常每两周举行一次，并根据综合排名系统 (CRS) 进行排名。	These draws usually take place every two weeks, and are ranked according to the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS).
	
CRS 是我们确定您是否适合并确保您有最大机会在加拿大过上成功生活的方式。要被选中接收加拿大永久居留申请邀请 (ITA)，您的分数需要高于 CRS 抽签截止分数。	The CRS is our way of finding out if you are well suited and to make sure that you have the best chances of living a successful life in Canada. To be selected to receive an Invitation to Apply (ITA) for permanent residence in Canada your score will need to be higher than that of the CRS draw cut-off score.
	
但是，最近国家职业分类 (NOC) 以培训、教育、经验和责任 (TEER) 级别的形式新增了内容。	However, recently there have been new additions to the National Occupational Classification (NOC) in the form of Training, Education, Experience and Responsibilities (TEER) levels.
	
TEER 级别系统降低了 CRS 分数在申请人选择优先级方面的重要性。相反，更多的重点放在工作经验、学到的知识、获得的技能和承担的责任上。	The TEER level system has diminished the importance of CRS scores with regards to priority of applicant selection. Instead, more emphasis is placed on work experience, knowledge learned, skills gained and responsibilities assumed.
	
最重要的是，在特定省份或地区创建快速通道档案并提交意向书（EOI）将允许地方政府通过与快速通道相关的省提名计划（PNP）为您提供省提名（PN） .一个 PN 价值 600 个额外的永久居留点，这可以让你比其他快速通道申请人更具优势。	And to top things off, creating an Express Entry profile and submitting an Expression of Interest (EOI) in a particular province or territory will allow local governments to give you a Provincial Nomination (PN) through Express Entry-linked Provincial Nominee Programs (PNPs). A PN is worth 600 extra permanent residency points, which could give you the edge you need over other Express Entry applicants.
	
为了顺利、快速地完成此过程，与 CanadianVisa 等移民咨询公司取得联系将非常有益。我们可以让您与我们的附属 RCIC 联系，他们不仅会帮助您建立经过评估的移民资料并准备好您的快速入境申请，他们还会在经过严格的流程后代表您提交意向书 (EOI)审查。	For smooth and swift navigation of this process, getting in touch with immigration consultancy companies like CanadianVisa will be very beneficial. We can get you in touch with our affiliated RCIC’s who will not only assist you in setting up your evaluated immigration profiles and getting your Express Entry application ready, they’ll also submit your Expression of Interest (EOI) on your behalf after a rigorous process of review.
	
### 省提名计划	Provincial Nominee Program
	
！	!
	
加拿大 13 个省和地区中的 11 个省提名计划面向所有技能水平的工人，他们具有该省或地区特定工作和经济部门所需的资格和工作经验。	11 of Canada’s 13 provinces and territories Provincial Nominee Programs are aimed at workers of all skill levels who have the qualifications and work experience needed in particular jobs and sectors of the economy of the province or territory.
	
要符合资格，您需要至少一年的有效工作机会，如果成功，您将收到一份 PN，这几乎可以保证您成功申请加拿大永久居留权。	To be eligible you will need a valid job offer for at least one year and if successful, you will receive a PN which could ultimately almost guarantee your success in applying for permanent residence in Canada.
	
为了通过 PNP 获得更快的处理时间，请尝试通过与 Express Entry 相关的 PNP 流程进行申请，因为这将使您有更好的机会从埃及移民到加拿大。	For faster processing times through the PNP try applying through Express Entry-linked PNP stream, as it will give you a better chance of immigrating to Canada from Egypt.
	
	Here are the individual provinces and the PNPs available in each as per the labor, skill and experience demands of those provinces.
	
* 阿尔伯塔 PNP	  Alberta PNP
* 不列颠哥伦比亚省 PNP	  British Columbia PNP
* 马尼托巴 PNP	  Manitoba PNP
* 新不伦瑞克 PNP	  New Brunswick PNP
* 新斯科舍 PNP	  Nova Scotia PNP
