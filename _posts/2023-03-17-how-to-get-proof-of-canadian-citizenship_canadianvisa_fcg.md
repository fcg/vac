!如何获得加拿大公民身份证明	!How to get Proof of Canadian Citizenship  
	
获得永久居留身份通常是大多数加拿大移民停止晋升加拿大国籍的地方。尽管永久居留身份持有人有权享受与加拿大公民相同的政府税收资助福利，但他们无权享受大量政治和经济权利。	The obtainment of permanent residency status is usually where most immigrants to Canada halt their advance up the Canadian nationality ranks. Though permanent residency status holders are entitled to the same government tax-funded benefits that Canadian citizens are entitled to, there is a significant amount of political and economic rights that they’re not entitled to.
	
在这些政府福利排除之后，决定申请加拿大公民身份的加拿大永久居留权持有人的数量显着增加。	In the wake of these governmental benefit exclusions, there has been a significant rise in the number of Canadian permanent residency holders who have decided to take the decision to apply for Canadian Citizenship.

## 加拿大公民身份	Canadian Citizenship
	
!加拿大签证	!CanadianVisa
	
加拿大公民身份授予其接受者世界上最有价值的法律地位之一。如果您成为加拿大公民，您有权获得许多合法权利和特权，包括：	Canadian citizenship grants its recipients one of the most valuable legal statuses in the world. If you become a Canadian citizen, there are a host of lawful rights and privileges that you are entitled to receive that includes:
	
- 在市、省和联邦/全国选举中投票的政治权利	-   The political right to vote in municipal, provincial and federal/national elections
- 在市、省和联邦/全国选举中竞选政治职位的政治权利	-   The political right to run for political office in municipal, provincial and federal/national elections
- 授予加拿大护照，这是世界上最有价值的护照之一，具有许多免签证要求的好处	-   The grant of a Canadian passport, which ranks as one of the most valued passports in the world with many visa-free requirement benefits
	
## 第 1 步：成为加拿大永久居留权持有人	Step 1: Become a Canadian Permanent Residency Holder
	
成为永久居民意味着您有权无限期地在加拿大生活、工作和学习。您被视为加拿大人口的一员，并享有加拿大人民的所有权利和责任。	Becoming a permanent resident means you have the right to live, work and study in Canada indefinitely. You are treated as a member of the Canadian population and are afforded all of the rights and responsibilities of the Canadian people.
	
在加拿大获得永久居留身份的最常见方法包括快速入境、省提名计划和家庭赞助。	The most common methods of obtaining permanent residency status in Canada include Express Entry, Provincial Nominee programs and Family Sponsorship.
	
### 快速通道	Express Entry
	
根据加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 网站，加拿大移民通过快速通道系统发出了 46,538 份申请永久居留权 (ITA) 的邀请。这使得快速通道成为加拿大最大的移民驱动力之一，因为 2023 年欢迎的移民总目标约为 485,000 名新移民。	According to the Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) website the Canadian immigrant issued 46,538 Invitations to Apply (ITA) for permanent residency via the Express Entry system. This makes Express Entry one of the biggest immigration drivers in Canada, as the total goal of immigrants welcomed for 2023 is approximately 485,000 newcomers.
	
### 省提名计划	Provincial Nominee Program
	
获得加拿大永久居留权的最佳途径之一是通过省提名计划 (PNP)。 PNP 专为具有技能、教育和工作经验的外国技术工人设计，可以为一个省的经济做出贡献，并希望永久居住在加拿大。	Among the best ways to get permanent residency in Canada is through the Provincial Nominee Program(PNP). PNPs are designed for skilled foreign workers with the skills, education, and work experience to contribute to a province's economy and who want to live in Canada permanently.
	
地方省份与政府达成协议，允许各省份提名熟练的外国工人成为永久居民。根据您的技能和特定省份的需求，您可以申请这 11 个省份和地区。	An agreement was made between the local provinces and the government that enables the provinces to nominate skilled foreign workers to become permanent residents. On the basis of your skills and the needs of a particular province, you can apply to these 11 provinces and territories.
