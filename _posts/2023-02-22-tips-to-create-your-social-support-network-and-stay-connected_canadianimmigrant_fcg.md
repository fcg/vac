**建立和加强关系以获得更好的健康**	**Build and strengthen relationships for better health**
	
我们都经历过生活中的困难时期。有支持的人可以依靠可以在管理这些困难时期有所作为。研究表明，拥有良好的社会关系有助于改善身心健康。特别是，社会支持可以作为新移民和移民以及健康和认知能力下降的老年人、患有精神疾病的人以及因残疾、种族、性别或性取向而被边缘化的人等群体的保护因素。	We all go through difficult periods in life. Having supportive people to count on can make the difference in managing those difficult times. Research has shown that having good social relationships contributes to improved psychological and physical well-being. In particular, social support can serve as a protective factor with newcomers and immigrants and also groups such as the elderly who have declining health and cognitive abilities, individuals with mental illnesses and those marginalized due to a disability, race, gender or sexual orientation.
	
发展和维护一个足够的社交网络，让您可以与之交谈、共度时光、寻求帮助并感受到支持，这对每个人来说都不是一件容易的事。诸如找不到时间、语言问题、搬到新地方、缺乏社交技能、自卑、不受欢迎的社区、贫困等障碍是可能干扰扩大支持关系的一些因素。	Developing and maintaining an adequate social network of people who you can talk to, spend time with, ask for help and feel supported is not easy for everyone. Barriers such as, not finding the time, language issues, moving to a new place, lacking social skills, low self-esteem, unwelcoming communities, poverty are a few factors that could interfere in expanding supportive relationships.
	
**以下是有关如何创建和扩展社会支持网络并保持联系的一般提示：**	**Here are general tips on how to create and expand a social support network and stay connected:**
	
1. 通过列出您认为积极支持您的人（家人、朋友、同事）来评估您的社会支持和关系。	1.  Evaluate your social support and connections by making a list of people (family, friends, colleagues) that you think are positive and supportive to you.
2. 突出显示您定期联系并检查您的健康状况的人。通过与电话、短信或访问保持联系并与他们交流来回报。	2.  Highlight the individuals that you are in touch with on a regular basis and who check on your well-being. Reciprocate by staying connected with phone calls, texts or visits and communicate with them.
3. 确定住在您附近并在紧急情况下可以为您提供帮助的支持人员。附近几乎没有可靠和支持的人可以帮助建立一个富有同情心的社区，还可以通过照顾他人来促进安全和关怀。	3.  Identify supportive individuals who live near you and can come to your assistance in case of an emergency. Having few reliable and supportive people in the neighborhood can help build a compassionate community and also promote safety and care by looking out for others.
4. 创建一个正式的支持系统列表，例如您可以信任的专业人士，并分享对您自己或您家人的担忧或担心。家庭医生、专家、教师、安置顾问或治疗师可以帮助讨论可能需要专业意见的问题。	4.  Create a list of formal support systems such as professionals whom you can trust and share concerns or worries about yourself or your family members. Family doctors, specialists, teachers, settlement counselors or therapists can be of help to discuss issues that may require professional opinions.
5. 研究和监控在线支持网络和其他社交网站，这些网站可以帮助您与他人保持联系并分享您的想法。它们很方便，可以帮助克服可访问性障碍，并且与治疗服务等其他传统支持来源相比通常是免费的。但是，出于隐私方面的考虑，以及您是否过于依赖它们而不是面对面的互动，您可能必须监控您在这些网站上分享了多少关于您自己的信息。	5.  Research and monitor online support networks and other social networking sites that help you stay in touch with others to connect and share your thoughts. They are convenient, can help overcome accessibility barriers and are usually free compared to other traditional sources of support such as therapy services. You may however have to monitor how much information you share about yourself on these sites due to privacy concerns and if you are relying too much on them rather than face-face interactions.
6. 学会识别你没有足够的社会支持网络的领域和原因，并制定目标策略来加强和建立更多的支持。以正确的态度和努力，可以培养和加强新的有效关系。一些有用的策略是：	6.  Learn to identify areas where and why you do not have an adequate social support network and target strategies to enhance and build more support. With the right attitude and your efforts new and effective relationships can be cultivated and strengthened. Some helpful strategies are:
7. 技能发展：如果您遇到困难，例如与人打交道的焦虑、沟通技巧问题、自卑和自信不足，您可以制定一个计划来发展和提高技能建设小组，或者单独与教练一起工作。	7.  Skills development: If you have difficulties such as anxieties of approaching people, communications skills issues, low self-esteem and low confidence, you can create a plan to develop and improve with skills building groups, or work individually with a coach.
8. 寻找机会：如果您要搬到一个新地方，寻找机会与您的邻居、学校的其他家长会面，或参加当地的体育或文化活动。加入符合您兴趣的俱乐部、班级、宗教团体或社区组织。	8.  Seek opportunities: If you are moving to a new place, find opportunities to meet your neighbors, other parents in school or attend local sports or cultural events. Join a club, class, religious groups or community organizations that match your interests.
9. 与你认识的人建立牢固的关系：通过经常保持联系、邀请他们过来、拜访他们、倾听他们的意见和提供帮助等努力来拉近和加强与人的联系。	9.  Develop strong relationships with people you know: Getting closer and strengthening bonds with people also comes with efforts such as keeping in touch often, inviting them over, visiting them, listening to them and offering help.
10. 获得支持：在需要时寻求帮助和支持也很重要。当您不知所措或有无法与直系亲属分享的疑虑时，请与专业人士、牧师或同事交谈。	10.  Get support: Asking for help and seeking support when you need is also important. Talk to a professional, priest or colleague when you are overwhelmed or have concerns which you cannot share with immediate family members.
11.贡献和分享你的技能：自愿帮助他人并与他人分享你的技能是非常有益的，也提供了与他人联系和合作的机会。	11.  Contribute and share your skills: Volunteering to help and sharing your skills with others can be very rewarding and also provide opportunity to connect and work with others.
12.设定目标：当生活忙于其他承诺时，安排时间进行社交和机会。设定可实现的简单、具体和现实的目标，例如“我将每天与一个人交谈或每月邀请一位朋友”将是一个良好的开端，并为您的成功做好准备。	12.  Set goals: When life is busy with other commitments, schedule time for social connections and opportunities. Setting simple, specific and realistic goals that are achievable such as, “I shall talk to one person every day or invite one friend monthly” will be a good beginning and set you up for success.
	
您可以尽自己的一份力量来扩大您多样化的社会关系，并专注于有意义和亲密的关系以促进个人幸福。尽管如此，对于机构和组织而言，同样重要的是制定公平的政策，帮助建立包容、支持的社区，并确定那些孤立、处于危险和需要支持的人，例如通过家访支持弱势群体和提供社会支持和反映不同文化需求的娱乐机会。	You can do your part in expanding your diverse set of social connections and focus on meaningful and close relationships for personal well-being. That said, it is also equally important for institutions and organizations to put equitable policies in place that help build inclusive, supportive communities and also identify those who are isolated, at-risk and need support such as supporting the vulnerable through home visits and providing social and recreational opportunities reflecting diverse cultural needs.
