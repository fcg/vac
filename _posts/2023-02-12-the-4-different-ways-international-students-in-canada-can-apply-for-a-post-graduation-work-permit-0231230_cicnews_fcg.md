毕业后工作许可 (PGWP) 计划为加拿大的国际学生提供了一种在从高等教育计划毕业并开始在这里建立生活和事业后留在该国的方式。	The Post-Graduation Work Permit (PGWP) program provides international students in Canada with a way to remain in the country after they graduate from a post-secondary educational program and start building a life and career here.
	
该计划提供长达三年的开放式工作许可，使加拿大指定学习机构 (DLI) 的任何毕业生都可以在申请时没有现有工作机会的情况下为他们选择的加拿大雇主工作。	This program provides an open work permit for up to three years, which enables any graduate from a Canadian designated learning institution (DLI) to work for a Canadian employer of their choice without an existing job offer at the time of application.
	
注意：虽然此计划允许最长三年的许可，但实际许可期限将取决于申请人毕业的教育计划的期限。	Note: While this program allows for permits of up to three years, the actual length of a permit will depend on the length of the educational program from which the applicant graduated.
	
### 一般PGWP申请流程	General PGWP application process
	
申请 PGWP 的过程可以在潜在申请人收到正式成绩单和确认计划完成的信件的同一天开始。	The process of applying for a PGWP can begin the very same day that a prospective applicant receives their official transcript and letter confirming program completion.
	
从今天起，所有寻求 PGWP 的国际学生都有六个月（180 天）的时间来提交申请。	From this day, all international students who seek a PGWP have six months (180 days) to submit their application.

Most applicants will be required to apply online, but paper applications will be made available in certain circumstances.
