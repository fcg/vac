了解快速通道打破平局规则 COVID-19 旅行限制要求 IRCC 自 2020 年 3 月中旬以来对每次快速通道抽签实施打破平局规则。在此处了解有关该规则的更多信息。	Understanding the Express Entry tie-breaking rule COVID-19 travel restrictions required IRCC to implement a tie-breaking rule for every Express Entry draw since mid-March 2020. Learn more about the rule here.
	
Express Entry 是加拿大联邦政府针对外国技术工人的首要移民途径。	Express Entry is the Canadian federal government’s top immigration pathway for foreign skilled workers.
	
为了帮助在具有相同综合排名系统 (CRS) 分数的快速通道候选人之间进行排名和选择，加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 引入了一项打破平局的规则，该规则基于“个人资料首次提交给”的日期和时间。快速通道池。”	To help rank and choose between Express Entry candidates with the same Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) score, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) introduced a tie-breaking rule that works based on the date and time that “profiles were first submitted to the Express Entry pool.”
	
该规则意味着自该规则引入以来，对于每次快速通道抽签，IRCC 都会列出一个截止日期和时间（根据协调世界时或 UTC）。每位高于特定抽签最低 CRS 分数且在截止日期之前也提交了个人资料的候选人都会通过加拿大永久居留权 (PR) 快速通道收到申请邀请 (ITA)。	This rule has meant that for every Express Entry draw since the rule was introduced, IRCC has listed a cut-off date and time (according to Coordinated Universal Time, or UTC). Every candidate above the minimum CRS score for a particular draw who also submitted their profile prior to the cut-off receives an Invitation to Apply (ITA) through Express Entry for Canadian Permanent Residency (PR).
	
### 打破平局规则的最新示例	A recent example of the tie-breaking rule
	
最近的一个例子是 2023 年 1 月 18 日进行的快速通道抽签。	A recent example of this would be the Express Entry draw that took place on January 18, 2023.
	
对于这次抽签，IRCC 发出了 5,550 个 ITA，最低 CRS 分数设置为 490。打破平局规则的日期和时间列为 2022 年 11 月 24 日 21:14:59 UTC。	For this draw, 5,550 ITAs were given out by IRCC, with the minimum CRS score set at 490. The date and time for the tie-breaking rule were listed as November 24, 2022, at 21:14:59 UTC.
	
在这种情况下，CRS 分数为 490 或更高并在上述截止日期之前提交了快速通道个人资料的候选人是在那次抽签期间收到 ITA 的组的一部分。	In this case, candidates who had a CRS score of 490 or higher and submitted their Express Entry profile before the above cut-off were part of the group who received an ITA during that draw.
	
### 关于打破平局规则的三个重要考虑因素	Three important considerations about the tie-breaking rule
	
尽管引入了打破平局的规则，但快速通道候选人应该记住一些重要的考虑因素。	Despite the introduction of the tie-breaking rule, there are a few important considerations that Express Entry candidates should remember.
	
**打破平局的规则并不优先于候选人的 CRS 分数**	**The tie-breaking rule does not take priority over a candidate’s CRS score**
	
候选人的 CRS 分数仍然是决定他们在任何抽签中与其他符合条件的 Express Entry 候选人之间排名的主要因素。顾名思义，这条规则只是为了打破具有相同 CRS 分数的 Express Entry 候选人之间的平局。	A candidate’s CRS score remains the primary factor in determining where they rank amongst other eligible Express Entry hopefuls for any draw. As the name suggests, again, this rule is simply in place to break a tie between Express Entry candidates with the same CRS score.
	
**修改或更新快速通道资料不会改变资料提交的原始时间戳**	**Modifying or updating an Express Entry profile does not alter the original timestamp of the profile submission**
	
例如，当候选人用新的语言测试结果或教育证书评估 (ECA) 更新他们的个人资料时，与给定快速通道个人资料相关的提交时间戳将保持不变。事实上，只有一种情况是候选人个人资料的提交时间戳会发生变化（更多内容见下文）。	The submission timestamp associated with a given Express Entry profile will remain constant when a candidate, for example, updates their profile with new language test results or an Educational Credential Assessment (ECA). In fact, there is only one circumstance where the submission timestamp of a candidate’s profile will change (more on that below).
	
**删除并使用新的个人资料重新申请快速通道将导致新的个人资料提交时间戳**	**Deleting and reapplying for Express Entry with a new profile will result in a new profile submission timestamp**
	
快速通道个人资料提交时间戳没有基于身份（姓名、生日等）的结转。例如，如果名为 Aniket Sharma（虚构）的个人申请快速通道，然后在稍后的日期和时间重新申请之前删除他们的个人资料，则记录的提交时间戳将反映 Aniket 重新加入候选人池的日期和时间与他们最初提交第一份个人资料时相反。	There is no identity-based (name, birthdate etc.) carryover of Express Entry profile submission timestamps. As an example, if an individual named Aniket Sharma (fictional) were to apply for Express Entry and then delete their profile before reapplying at a later date and time, the recorded submission timestamp would reflect the date and time that Aniket rejoined the candidate pool as opposed to when they initially submitted their first profile.
