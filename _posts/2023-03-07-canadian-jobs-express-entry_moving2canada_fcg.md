## 虽然移民加拿大不需要工作机会，但拥有加拿大经验（例如工作或学习经验）可以为众多经济类移民项目打开大门。	While having a job offer is not required to immigrate to Canada, having Canadian experience—such as work or study experience—can open the doors to numerous economic-class immigration programs.
	
如果您正在加拿大寻找一份可以帮助您获得永久居留权的工作，请务必记住，在决定项目时您的职业很重要。	If you are looking for a job in Canada that could help you on your pathway to permanent residency, it’s important to remember that your occupation matters when it comes time to decide on a program.
	
加拿大政府使用国家职业分类 (NOC) 系统对职业进行分类。加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 在去年 11 月将其系统更新为最新版本 NOC 2021。	The Canadian government uses the National Occupation Classification (NOC) system in order to classify occupations. Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) updated its systems to the latest version, NOC 2021, this past November.
	
当前的 NOC 分为六个培训、教育、经验和责任 (TEER) 类别。对于一些最受欢迎的加拿大经济类移民计划，您需要从事属于 TEER 类别 0、1、2 或 3 的“技术”职业。	The current NOC is broken up into six Training, Education, Experience, and Responsibilities (TEER) categories. For some of the most popular economic-class immigration programs to Canada, you need to be working in a “skilled” occupation which falls under TEER categories 0, 1, 2, or 3.
	
IRCC 最近发布了 2022 年移民数据，除其他统计数据外，这些数据还提供了去年大多数移民打算从事的职业。	IRCC has recently released 2022 immigration data, which provide—among other stats—the occupations where most immigrants intended to work last year.
	
IRCC 最近还发布了 2021 年快速入境报告。快速通道是加拿大移民的主要途径之一。	IRCC also recently released its 2021 Express Entry Report. Express Entry is one of the main pathways to Canadian immigration.
	
使用两个官方 IRCC 数据源，我们得出了一些新移民最常见的职业，以及那些被邀请通过快速通道申请移民的人。	Using two official IRCC data sources, we came up with some of the most common occupations of new immigrants, and those who were invited to apply for immigration through Express Entry.

_**注意：** 数据来自 IRCC 的网站，使用的是 NOC 的旧版本。因此，本报告中的职位名称可能与当前的 NOC 2021 不一致。_	_**Note:** The data, derived from IRCC’s website, uses a former version of the NOC. For this reason, job titles in this report may be inconsistent with the current NOC 2021._
	
### 最受欢迎的工作	Most popular jobs
	
2022年，以下是加拿大新移民最受欢迎的五个职业：	In 2022, these were the five most popular occupations of new immigrants to Canada:
	
1. **食品服务主管**	1.  **Food service supervisors**
2. **软件工程师**	2.  **Software engineers**
3. **行政助理**	3.  **Administrative assistants**
4. **计算机程序员和交互式媒体开发人员**	4.  **Computer programmers and interactive media developers**
5. **信息系统分析师和顾问**	5.  **Information systems analysts and consultants**
	
结果似乎或多或少与 Express Entry 候选人一致，即使考虑到与大流行相关的因素。	The results seem to be more-or-less consistent with Express Entry candidates, even considering pandemic-related factors.
	
2021 年快速通道年度报告详细介绍了当年受邀候选人的共同特征——包括最常见的主要职业是什么。	The 2021 Express Entry annual report goes into details on what characteristics invited candidates shared that year—including what the most common primary occupations were.
	
2021 年对于 Express Entry 来说是独特的一年。只有符合加拿大经验类 (CEC) 资格或获得省提名计划 (PNP) 提名的候选人才会被邀请申请。	2021 was a unique year for Express Entry. Candidates were only invited to apply if they were eligible for the Canadian Experience Class (CEC) or if they had a nomination from a Provincial Nominee Program (PNP).
	
由于旅行限制，IRCC 将邀请轮次集中在这些项目上，因为它们比其他项目更有可能让候选人已经在加拿大。	Because of travel restrictions, IRCC focused invitation rounds on these programs because they were more likely than others to have candidates already in Canada.
	
因此，2021 年受邀的团队与往年不同。	As such, the group that was invited in 2021 was unlike any other year.
	
由于加拿大在 2021 年仅举行了针对 CEC 和 PNP 的抽签，因此与往年相比，受邀申请技术和技能行业工作的人数更多。例如，在 2019 年和 2020 年，受邀候选人倾向于从事通常需要大学学位的专业工作。	Since Canada held only CEC- and PNP-specific draws in 2021, there were more people invited to apply in technical and skilled trades jobs than compared to previous years. In 2019 and 2020, for example, invited candidates tended to work in professional jobs that usually call for a university degree.
	
下表显示了 2019-2021 年被邀请申请的 Express Entry 候选人最常见的五个主要职业。	The following table shows the five most common primary occupations of Express Entry candidates who were invited to apply in 2019-2021.

### Express Entry：按性别划分的热门工作	Express Entry: Popular jobs by gender
	
按性别分类的数据很重要，因为它们有助于揭示劳动力中性别的复杂现实。	Data disaggregated by gender are important because they help shed light on the complex realities of gender in the work force.
	
在收到 ITA 时，男性和女性最常报告的主要职业是食品服务主管。除此之外，男性和女性的其他顶级职业也有所不同。	At the time of receiving an ITA, both men and women most commonly reported their primary occupation was food service supervisor. Beyond that, men and women’s other top occupations differed somewhat.
	
不在男性前 15 名之列的四大女性职业包括：	The four top occupations amongst women that are not in the top 15 for men include:
	
1. **幼儿教育工作者和助理；**	1.  **Early childhood educators and assistants;**
2. **会计技术人员和簿记员；**	2.  **Accounting technicians and bookkeepers;**
3. **广告、营销和公共关系等专业；**	3.  **Professional occupations in advertising, marketing and public relations;**
4. **财务销售代表。**	4.  **Financial sales representatives.**
	
男性中未进入女性前 15 名的四个顶级职业包括：	Four of the top occupations among men that do not rank in the top 15 for women include:
	
1. **主管、供应链、跟踪和调度协调职业；**	1.  **Supervisors, supply chain, tracking and scheduling co-ordination occupations;**
2. **机械师和机床检查员；**	2.  **Machinists and machine tooling inspectors;**
3. **计算机和信息系统管理员；**	3.  **Computers, and information systems managers;**
4. **其他服务主管。**	4.  **Other service supervisors.**

### 带积分安排就业	With points for arranged employment
	
某些快速通道候选人可能有资格根据安排的就业获得额外的综合排名系统 (CRS) 积分。	Certain Express Entry candidates may be eligible to get additional Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) points based on arranged employment.
	
下表仅关注获得有效工作机会而获得这些加分的人的职业。	The following table just focuses on the occupations of those who got these extra points for having a valid job offer.
	
就像整体的快速通道候选人一样，这些职业中的大多数都从事以前被称为“技能类型 B”但现在被视为 TEER 2 或 3 的工作。	Much like Express Entry candidates overall, most of these occupations are in jobs that were formerly referred to as “skill type B” but would now be considered TEER 2 or 3.
	
！	!
	
###按性别排列就业分	Arranged employment points by gender
	
总的来说，快速通道池中的男性更经常获得安排就业的分数。在收到符合条件的工作邀请的 ITA 的候选人中，有三分之二是男性。	Overall, men in the Express Entry pool more often got points for arranged employment. Two thirds of candidates who received ITAs with eligible job offers were men.
	
与男性同行相比，被安排就业点的受邀女性中最常见的职业包括更多的“B类技能职业”（2021年的称呼）。其中包括食品服务主管、厨师、行政助理、幼儿教育工作者和行政人员。	The most common occupations among invited women with arranged employment points included more “skill type B occupations” (as they were called in 2021) in comparison to their male counterparts. These include food service supervisors, cooks, administrative assistants, early childhood educators, and administrative officers.
	
尽管男性在 2021 年也看到了更多具有安排就业的 B 类技能职业，但 A 类技能工作（现在与 TEER 1 相当）在顶级职业中更为常见。这些类型的工作包括软件工程师、计算机程序员和交互式媒体开发人员，以及信息系统分析师和顾问。	Whereas men also saw more skill type B occupations with arranged employment in 2021, skill type A jobs (now comparable to TEER 1), were more common among top occupations. These types of jobs include software engineers, computer programmers and interactive media developers, and information systems analysts and consultants.

### 综上所述……	All that being said…
	
我们不希望您离开这里时认为只有获得永久居留权的人才拥有所谓的“技术”工作。	We don’t want you to leave here thinking the only people who get permanent residence have so-called “skilled” jobs.
	
你确实需要至少有一定的“熟练工作经验”才能进入快速通道池，但你的选择肯定不止于此。	You do need to have at least a certain amount of “skilled work experience” in order to get into the Express Entry pool, but your options certainly don’t stop there.
	
加拿大经济移民计划的基础是劳动力市场某处存在缺口，而世界各地都有能够并愿意填补这一缺口的人。	Canadian economic immigration programs are built on the idea that there is a gap in the labour market somewhere, and that there are people all over the world who are able and willing to fill that gap.
	
当然，如果您有资格获得家庭担保或难民移民，那么您的工作就不是一个选择因素（尽管，我们不要低估难民的经济流动途径试点）。	And of course, if you are eligible for family sponsorship or refugee immigration then your job is not a selection factor (although, let’s not discount the Economic Mobility Pathway Pilot for refugees).
	
如果您正在考虑通过经济移民途径前往加拿大，您也可以根据为某些类型的工人量身定制的计划获得资格。	If you are thinking of taking the economic immigration route to Canada, you could also become eligible under programs that are tailored for certain types of workers.
