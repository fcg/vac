The labour shortage in Canada continues to be a pressing issue for the Canadian government. Studies have shown that the Canadian labour market is dependent on high levels of immigration to address the shortage. Looking towards 2023, immigration will be key to filling essential roles and addressing the labour gap.

Welcoming skilled newcomers to Canada continues to be a goal of the Canadian government for 2023 and beyond. With nearly one million job vacancies, there is a major demand for skilled workers to fill the available positions. Overseas candidates with experience in in-demand occupations are expected to have strong prospects in the Canadian labour market in 2023 and could be strong applicants for skilled immigration programs.

Looking at targeted Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) draws across Canada sheds light on which jobs are in demand in terms of immigration. Generally, careers in the health care sector, technology field, and scientific areas tend to be in high demand across the country.
