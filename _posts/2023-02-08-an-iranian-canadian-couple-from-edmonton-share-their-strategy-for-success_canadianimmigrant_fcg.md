2013 年，我和妻子第一次来到多伦多。我已经完成了理学硕士学位，还在伊朗工作了几年，此外还在英国完成了交通工程博士学位。我们在加拿大的第一次逗留时间很短；我们仍然需要处理回家的事情。 2015 年 2 月，我们回到埃德蒙顿，发现城市街道被白雪覆盖。我们选择埃德蒙顿是因为我们有家人，我妻子 Azam Nikad 的叔叔。	I first landed in Toronto with my wife in 2013. I had completed my Master’s degree in Science and also worked for several years in Iran, in addition to finishing my PhD in Transportation Engineering in the U.K. Our first stay in Canada was short; we still had to take care of things back home. It was in February 2015 that we came back to Edmonton to find the city streets covered in snow. We chose Edmonton because we had some family, my wife Azam Nikad’s uncle.
	
从一开始，我就意识到在加拿大社区建立网络和志愿服务的价值。考虑到我在这里没有网络，我意识到我需要通过结识新的和令人兴奋的人来创造新的体验。我决定通过在社区做志愿者并加入与我的职业相关的组织来实现这一目标。	From the early days, I realized the value of networking and volunteering in Canadian communities. Considering that I didn’t have a network here, I was aware that I needed to create new experiences by meeting new and exciting people. I decided to make this happen by volunteering in the community, and joining organizations related to my career.
	
加拿大土木工程学会 (CSCE) 的埃德蒙顿分会是我加入的第一个专业社区。他们的主席邀请我参加他们每月的董事会会议，这是一个热情友好的执行董事会，总是为新成员提供空间。我还在埃德蒙顿公共图书馆 (EPL)、当地铁人三项赛和其他体育赛事以及一个发展与和平倡导组织做志愿者。	The Canadian Society for Civil Engineering (CSCE)’s Edmonton Section was the first professional community that I joined. Their chair invited me to their monthly board meeting, a welcoming and friendly executive board that always had space for the new members. I also  volunteered at the Edmonton Public Library (EPL), local triathlon and other sports events, as well as with a development and peace advocacy group.
	
除了熟悉加拿大的工作环境外，志愿服务还帮助我与不同的人建立了联系并建立了强大的网络。我参与这些组织让我有机会向他们学习，成为他们团队的一员并扩大我的网络。除此之外，志愿服务提高了我的领导能力，拓宽了我对新家的了解，并使我获得了指导支持。在上述任何组织中投入时间帮助我丰富了我的简历，并为我的职业生涯打开了大门。	Volunteering helped me to made connections with different people and  build a strong network, in addition to getting familiar with the Canadian work environment. My involvement with these organizations provided me the opportunity to learn from them, be part of their team and expand my network. Besides that, volunteering sharpened my leadership skills, broadened my knowledge about my new home and connected me with mentorship support. Investing time in any of the above-mentioned organizations helped me build my resume and opened the doors to build my career.
	
**今天，我继续把自己放在那里并使用相同的策略：志愿服务和网络。我对任何移民的建议是使用这两个关键工具来帮助您在加拿大取得成功。**	**Today, I continue to put myself out there and use the same strategy: volunteering and networking. My advice to any immigrant is to use these two key tools to help you find success in Canada.**

阿占尼克扎德	Azam Nikzad
	
在这段旅程中，我的妻子 Azam 一直陪伴着我。在来加拿大之前，她在墨西哥、伊朗和意大利的不同环境中工作和学习，并获得了她的第一个园艺博士学位。她在阿尔伯塔大学攻读了第二个植物育种博士学位。凭借七项择优奖学金和四篇发表的同行评议文章，加上她在蘑菇行业的科学背景和实践经验，她现在是北美最大的有机蘑菇公司之一的技术经理。	My wife, Azam, was always with me on this journey. Before coming to Canada, she worked and studied in diverse environments in Mexico, Iran and Italy, and earned her first PhD in horticulture. She pursued a second PhD in plant breeding at the University of Alberta.  Following seven merit-based scholarships and four published peer reviewed articles, her scientific background and hands-on experience in the mushroom industry, she is now a technical manager with one of the biggest organic mushroom companies in North America.
	
参加 MBA 课程并与全球内部和外部利益相关者中非常多样化的团队合作，帮助她成为了一位鼓舞人心的领导者。	Participating in an MBA program and working with very diverse teams within internal and external stakeholders across globe helped her to become an inspiring leader.
	
**Azam 强调自我领导对于任何正在寻找领导角色的移民的重要性。她说：“自我领导就是管理我们自己的 VABE（价值观、假设、信念和期望）。如果您能够领导自己并管理自己的 VABE，那么您将能够领导他人。”**	**Azam stresses the importance of self-leadership for any immigrant who is looking for leadership roles. She says “Self-leadership is about managing our own VABEs (values, assumptions, beliefs and expectations) . If you are able to  lead yourself and manage your own VABEs, you will be able to lead others.”**
