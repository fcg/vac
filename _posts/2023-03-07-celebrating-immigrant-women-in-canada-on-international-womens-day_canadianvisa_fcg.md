!在国际妇女节庆祝加拿大的移民妇女	!Celebrating Immigrant Women in Canada on International Women’s Day
	
加拿大在妇女权利方面经常走在前沿。该国于 1917 年授予了投票权，1951 年，加拿大迈出了迈向工作场所性别平等的第一个重要步骤。从那时起，进步的立法使加拿大成为世界各地女性的安全、稳健的环境。	Canada has often been ahead of the curve regarding women’s rights. The country granted The Vote in 1917, and in 1951, Canada took its first significant steps toward gender equality in the workplace. Since then, the progressive legislation has allowed Canada to become a safe, robust environment for women from all over the world.
	
## 女性移民加拿大	Immigration of Women to Canada
	
2022 年，加拿大迎来了近 50 万移民。大约一半，即总共 242,884 名女性移民抵达加拿大。在世界庆祝 3 月 8 日国际妇女节之际，让我们来看看加拿大如何成为女性平等运动的先驱。	In 2022, almost 500,000 immigrants were welcomed into Canada. About half, or a total of 242,884 female immigrants, arrived in Canada. As the world celebrates March 8 as International Women’s Day, let's take a look at how Canada has become a pioneer in the female equality movement.
	
2023 年，加拿大选择了“每个女人都很重要”作为国际妇女节的主题。它提醒人们，所有女性，无论年龄或背景如何，在加拿大文化的各个方面都占有一席之地，包括经济、社会和政治领域。	In 2023, Canada chose the theme ‘Every Woman Counts’ for its International Women’s Day. It serves as a reminder that all women, regardless of age or background, have a position in all aspects of Canadian culture, including the economic, social, and political realms.
	
它通过提醒今天的孩子，主要是女孩，她们的梦想是可以实现的，以此来表彰加拿大有成就的女性。	It honours the accomplished women in Canada by reminding today's children and mainly, girls, that their dreams are attainable.
	
从首席执行官到牙科保健员和农业工人，移民妇女在加拿大各个领域的劳动力中都占有一席之地。	From CEOs to dental hygienists and agricultural workers, immigrant women have a place in Canada’s workforce across all fields.
	
超过 500 个团体为加拿大各地的移民提供定居帮助。他们中的许多人特别迎合女性。	Over 500 groups provide settlement assistance to immigrants across Canada. Many of them cater especially to women.
	
### 种族化的新移民女性飞行员	Racialized Newcomer Women Pilot
	
有色人种移民妇女在加拿大劳动力中的收入继续减少。由于歧视和类似的障碍，他们经常难以在加拿大获得并保持出色的工作。	Immigrant women of colour continue to make less in the labour force in Canada. Because of discrimination and similiar barriers, they frequently have difficulty getting and retaining excellent employment in Canada.
	
该试点项目为加拿大移民女性提供定居服务和支持，以改善她们的工作成果和职业发展。	The pilot program provides settling services and support to Canadian immigrant women to improve their job results and professional progression.
	
该计划将有助于增加新移民有色人种女性完全平等地参与经济活动的机会。	This program will help to increase chances for newcomer women of colour to engage in the economy wholly and equally.
	
### 职业女性社区中心 (WWCC)	Working Women Community Centre (WWCC)
	
Working Women Community Centre 是多伦多一个以女性为中心的安置组织，为移民提供帮助。自 1974 年以来，她们一直在对外国妇女及其家人的生活产生影响。	Working Women Community Centre is a women-focused settlement organization in Toronto that assists immigrants. They have been making an impact on the lives of foreign women and their families since 1974.
	
WWCC 去年在大多伦多地区的四个地点为 9,600 多名客户提供服务。如果没有帮助他们融入加拿大环境，许多移民将与贫困和失业作斗争。当新移民得到适当的帮助并获得适当的机会时，他们就会在他们的社区中蓬勃发展。	The WWCC serviced over 9,600 customers last year from four locations throughout the Greater Toronto Area. Many immigrants battle with poverty and unemployment if they are not assisted in integrating into the Canadian environment. Newcomers flourish in their communities when they receive the right assistance and have access to the right chances.
	
四十多年来，WWCC 一直致力于确保人们能够获得促进健康社区的计划和服务。从搬迁指导和社区项目到经济发展和英语教学、教育支持和公民参与，每个人都能有所收获。	For more than four decades, the WWCC has fought to ensure that people have access to the programs and services that promote healthy neighbourhoods. There is something for everyone, from relocation guidance and community projects to economic development and English language teaching, educational support, and citizen involvement.
	
## 加拿大国际妇女节	International Women's Day in Canada
	
国际妇女节是一个世界性的日子，旨在承认和享受妇女和女童在社会、经济、文化和政治方面取得的成就。这也是提高人们对在实现性别平等方面取得的进展的认识并认识到仍然需要做的工作的时候。	International Women's Day is a worldwide day to acknowledge and enjoy the social, economic, cultural, and political accomplishments of women and girls. It is also a time to promote consciousness about the progress made toward gender equity and recognize that work still needs to be done.
	
国际妇女节的起源可以追溯到二十世纪初。它因北美和欧洲的劳工团体活动而出现，表现出越来越多的妇女平等参与社会的愿望。	The roots of International Women's Day can be traced back to the early twentieth century. It emerged due to labour groups' activities in North America and Europe, and it demonstrated a growing desire for women's equal participation in society.
	
今天，国际妇女节在全球许多国家被视为团结、欢乐、沉思、倡导和行动的日子。	Today, International Women's Day is observed in many nations around the globe as a day of unity, joy, contemplation, advocacy, and action.
	
## 加拿大的妇女权利	Women’s Rights in Canada
	
加拿大的女性和男性享有平等的权利和自由。政府保护身处危险境地的妇女，帮助她们康复，并将她们与受资助的服务联系起来。	Women and men in Canada have equal rights and liberties. The government safeguards women in risky circumstances, assists them in healing and connects them to funded services.
	
> 根据 1977 年《加拿大人权法》，所有加拿大人都有权享有平等、公平的机会、合理的待遇以及不受基于性别、性取向、婚姻状况或家庭状况的歧视的氛围。	> According to the 1977 Canadian Human Rights Act, all Canadians have the right to equality, equitable chance, reasonable treatment, and an atmosphere free of discrimination based on gender, sexual orientation, marital status, or family status.
	
已婚妇女财产权的合法化是加拿大妇女实现平等的首要举措之一。	The legalization of married women's property rights was one of the first moves toward equity for Canadian women.
	
从 1884 年的安大略省和 1900 年的马尼托巴省开始，已婚妇女财产法赋予已婚妇女与男性相同的法律特权，允许妇女签订法律协议和购买土地。	Beginning in Ontario in 1884 and Manitoba in 1900, the Married Women's Property Act granted married women the same legal privileges as males, allowing women to enter into legal agreements and purchase land.
	
在二十世纪之交，妇女被拒绝在省级和联邦选举中投票的机会。这种情况在 1916 年开始发生变化，当时妇女在艾伯塔省、马尼托巴省和萨斯喀彻温省的省级选举中获得了投票权。 1917 年，妇女在不列颠哥伦比亚省和安大略省获得了投票权。	Women were refused the opportunity to vote in provincial and federal elections at the turn of the twentieth century. This started to alter in 1916 when women got the right to vote in the Alberta, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan provincial elections. Women were given the ability to vote in British Columbia and Ontario in 1917.
	
1951 年安大略省通过了《公平就业实践法》和《女性雇员公平报酬法》，这是实现工作场所性别平等的首批重大举措之一。	The passage of the Fair Employment Practices Act and the Female Employees Fair Remuneration Act in Ontario in 1951 was one of the first significant moves toward gender equity in the workplace.
	
## 掌权的女性	Women in Power
	
长期以来，性别参与一直是加拿大政治中一个有争议的话题。	Gender participation has long been a contentious topic in Canadian politics.
	
Louise McKinney was the first woman elected to a provincial assembly in Canada in the 1917 Alberta general election. Agnes Macphail 是第一位在 1921 年加拿大联邦选举中投票进入下议院的女性。她非常有名地说，	Louise McKinney was the first woman elected to a provincial assembly in Canada in the 1917 Alberta general election. Agnes Macphail was the first woman voted to the House of Commons in the 1921 Canadian federal election. She very famously said,
	
> “我不想成为任何家庭的天使；我想要自己想要的和其他女人想要的一样，绝对的平等。确保了这一点之后，男人和女人就可以轮流当天使了。”	> "I do not want to be the angel of any home; I want for myself what I want for other women, absolute equality. After that is secured, then men and women can take turns at being angels."
	
金坎贝尔是加拿大唯一的女总理。加拿大参议院在 2020 年 11 月短暂实现了性别均等，有 47 名男性成员和 47 名女性成员。	Kim Campbell was Canada's only female Prime Minister. The Senate in Canada briefly reached gender parity, with 47 male and 47 female members in November of 2020.
	
加拿大有一长串女性内阁成员，其中包括农业和农业食品部长、尊敬的 Marie-Claude Bibeau 和尊敬的外交部长 Mélanie Joly。	Canada has a long list of female cabinet members, with the likes of Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, The Honourable Marie-Claude Bibeau and The Honourable Mélanie Joly, Minister of Foreign Affairs, among their ranks.
	
尽管自那时以来女性政治参与度有所提高，而且政党已经将女性候选人人数的增加视为一项组织和政治目标，但政府认为，在解决性别差异问题上还有很多工作要做。	Although female political participation has grown since then, and political parties have recognized growing the number of female candidates as an organizing and political objective, the government believes there is still more that can be done to address gender disparity.
	
加入数以千计的女性的行列，她们期待加拿大拥有一个性别平等、无限机会和强有力保护她们权利的环境。	Join the thousands of women that look to Canada for an environment with gender equality, endless opportunities, and strong protection of their rights.
