一项新的民意调查显示，世界各地越来越多的人希望移居加拿大。	More and more people around the world want to move to Canada, a new poll shows.
	
每年，加拿大都会迎来数十万新移民、国际学生和临时工。	Every year, Canada welcomes hundreds of thousands of new immigrants, international students, and temporary workers.
	
根据最新的人口普查，大约 23% 的加拿大人口是登陆移民——永久居民和归化的加拿大公民。我们可以轻松地说，加拿大近四分之一的人是——或曾经是——永久居民。	As per the latest census, about 23 percent of Canada’s population consists of landed immigrants — permanent residents and naturalized Canadian citizens. We can comfortably say that nearly one in four people in Canada are—or have been—permanent residents.
	
一项新的盖洛普民意调查显示，还有更多人希望前来。据估计，2021 年有 7400 万人想移居加拿大，几乎是目前 3800 万人口的两倍。	A new Gallup poll shows that many more still wish to come. An estimated 74 million people wanted to move to Canada in 2021, which is nearly twice its current population of 38 million.
	
事实证明，移居加拿大的愿望十多年来一直在增长。 2011 年，全球 5% 的潜在移民将加拿大列为首选目的地，但到 2021 年，这一比例上升至 8%。在过去十年中，加拿大已经超越英国、德国和法国等目的地，成为第二大最理想的移民目的地。尽管美国仍位居第一，但加拿大正在迅速取得进展。！	It turns out, the desire to move to Canada has grown over a decade. In 2011, 5 percent of potential migrants worldwide named Canada their top destination of choice, but in 2021 it was up to 8 percent. Over the past decade Canada has leapfrogged the UK, Germany, and France, among other destinations, to become the second-most desired migration destination. And though the United States remains in first place, Canada is quickly gaining ground.!
	
### 为什么选择加拿大？	Why Canada?
	
加拿大在公民自由、生活质量、经济自由、安全和其他方面的国际衡量标准中一直名列前茅。外国公民也有大量的工作机会和获得公民身份的途径。	Canada consistently ranks in the top of international measurements of civil liberties, quality of life, economic freedom, security and others. There are also an abundance of job opportunities and pathways to citizenship for foreign nationals.
	
在移民想来加拿大的同时，加拿大人普遍希望有更多的新移民。在接下来的三年里，加拿大准备再接纳近 150 万永久居民。	At the same time that migrants want to come to Canada, Canadians generally want more newcomers. Over the next three years, Canada is preparing to accept nearly 1.5 million more permanent residents.
	
长期以来，加拿大一直将移民作为抵消其人口老龄化和低出生率的一种方式。此外，加拿大认识到国际人才在缓解劳动力短缺方面的重要性。	Canada has long turned to immigration as one way to offset its aging population and low birth rate. Furthermore, Canada recognizes the importance of international talent in easing its labour shortages.
	
然而，对于所有希望来加拿大的人来说，实际上只有一部分人会入境。到 2023 年，加拿大将接纳 465,000 名新永久居民。这些新移民中约有 57% 将通过省提名计划 (PNP) 和快速入境系统管理的计划等经济类移民计划被接受。其余的将来自家庭赞助（23%）和难民、人道主义/同情和其他流派（20%）。	However, for all the people who wish to come to Canada, only a portion will actually get in. In 2023, Canada is accepting 465,000 new permanent residents. About 57 percent of these newcomers will be accepted through economic-class immigration programs such as Provincial Nominee Programs (PNPs) and programs managed by the Express Entry system. The rest will come through family sponsorship (23 percent) and refugee, humanitarian/compassionate, and other streams (20 percent).
	
拥有加拿大经验——无论是作为学生还是临时工——不仅有助于潜在移民满足更多经济项目的资格标准，而且研究表明，抵达加拿大前的经验有助于新永久居民在加拿大劳动力市场取得成功。	Having Canadian experience—as either a student or a temporary worker—not only helps potential immigrants meet eligibility criteria for more economic programs, but studies have suggested that pre-arrival experience in Canada helps new permanent residents succeed in Canada’s labour force.
