加拿大移民寻找工作的努力因技能不匹配而变得复杂 加拿大雇主可能对移民的技能和就业能力有偏见。这影响了他们在加拿大找到工作的能力，但这个问题可能有解决方案。	Canadian immigrants’ efforts to find employment complicated by perceived skills mismatch Canadian employers may have a skewed perception of immigrants' skills and employability. This is affecting their ability to find work in Canada, but there may be a solution to this problem.
	
加拿大技术移民面临这样一种看法，即他们可能不具备在加拿大从事许多他们可能在其原籍国从事的相同工作所需的技能/才能。	Skilled Canadian immigrants are being confronted by a perception that they may not possess the skills/aptitudes required to perform many of the same jobs in Canada that they might have performed in their country of origin.
	
这种看法主要基于三个因素：移民缺乏加拿大工作经验、“语言问题”以及加拿大承认外国教育证书和/或工作经验方面的陷阱。	This perception is built largely on three factors: immigrants’ lack of Canadian work experience, “language problems”, and pitfalls with respect to Canada’s recognition of foreign educational credentials and/or work experience.
	
事实上，圭尔夫大学人力资源管理专家 Nita Chhinzer 明确指出了加拿大一些雇主之间存在的“偏见”。根据 Chhinzer 的说法，这些偏见导致雇主对外国教育/工作经验的怀疑以及对移民语言能力的假设。	In fact, University of Guelph human resources management expert Nita Chhinzer explicitly noted “biases” that exist among some employers in Canada. These biases, according to Chhinzer, result in the discrediting of foreign education/work experience by employers as well as assumptions being made about an immigrant’s language proficiency.
	
不幸的是，这一现实对这个国家的一些移民的生活经历产生了明显的负面影响。	Unfortunately, this reality has had a noticeably negative effect on the lived experience of some immigrants in this country.
	
### 这种感知到的加拿大移民技能不匹配的后果	Consequences of this perceived skills mismatch for Canadian immigrants
	
围绕移民技能不匹配的普遍看法的一个后果是，加拿大的新移民似乎被忽略了工作机会，而不是接受足够的培训来尝试和缓解这些问题。	One consequence of the prevailing perception around the immigrant skills mismatch is that newcomers to Canada are seemingly being passed over for job opportunities rather than being given adequate training to try and mitigate these issues.
	
这在加拿大银行 (BoC) 行长 Tiff Macklem 的话中显而易见。麦克勒姆认识到加拿大需要增加移民以支持加拿大的劳动力，他在 11 月 10 日由多伦多公共政策论坛组织的演讲中提到了以下关于移民的问题。	This is evident in the words of Bank of Canada (BoC) Governor Tiff Macklem. Recognizing Canada’s need for heightened immigration to support Canada’s workforce, Macklem mentioned the following about immigrants at his November 10th speech organized by the Public Policy Forum of Toronto.
	
“增加移民增加了潜在的工人。 ......政府需要确保新移民顺利进入劳动力市场，并提供证书认可和定居支持，如语言和技能培训。 ......企业\[也\]需要投资于培训，这样我们才能减少技能不匹配。”	“Increased immigration adds potential workers. … Governments need to ensure newcomers have a smooth path into the workforce, with credential recognition and settlement support like language and skills training. … Businesses \[also\] need to invest in training so we can reduce the skills mismatch.”
	
**注：**在这次演讲中，麦克勒姆还反驳了加拿大移民与就业机会之间严重技能不匹配的观点。	**Note:** During this speech, Macklem also pushed back against the idea of a severe skills mismatch between immigrants and employment opportunities in Canada.
	
由于“技能不匹配”，加拿大移民不适合从事技术工作的信念也让一些新移民对他们在这个国家的繁荣未来前景感到沮丧。	The belief that Canadian immigrants are not suited to perform skilled work due to a “skills mismatch” has also driven some newcomers to feel discouraged about their prospects for a prosperous future in this country.
	
例如，一位去年6月移居多伦多的印度移民表示，她无法在加拿大找到工作是一个“令人心碎”的现实。在孟买担任人力资源经理十多年后，Tanya Raizada 移民到加拿大，并在不到四个月的时间里申请了 600 个职位。在仅接到 20 个面试电话和零个工作机会后，她决定于 2022 年 9 月搬回印度。	For instance, one Indian immigrant who moved to Toronto in June of last year said that her inability to find a job in Canada was a “heartbreaking” reality. After working as a human resources manager in Mumbai for over a decade, Tanya Raizada immigrated to Canada and applied for 600 jobs in just under four months. After receiving just 20 interview calls and zero job offers, she decided to move back to India in September 2022.
	
在接受 Global News 采访时，Raizada 说：“我个人觉得\[在加拿大\]是个失败者。”	In an interview she did with Global News, Raizada said “I was personally feeling like a failure \[in Canada\].”
	
最终，这些后果有可能不利于加拿大全国各地的移民体验，但可能有一种方法可以开始纠正这个问题。	Ultimately, these consequences have the potential to be detrimental to the Canadian experience of immigrants across the country, but there may be a way to begin rectifying this problem.
	
### 努力为加拿大移民解决这个问题	Working to rectify this problem for immigrants to Canada
	
要纠正这个国家的移民因技能不匹配而导致他们成为加拿大就业机会的不佳人选的看法，首先要从政府层面进行政策审查。	Rectifying the perception that immigrants in this country suffer from a skills mismatch that makes them poor candidates for Canadian employment opportunities begins with a policy review at the government level.
	
审查当前的移民和就业政策可以帮助加拿大更好地将外国工作经验与加拿大的工作经验结合起来，这将更好地使该国的雇主认识到移民通过其国际工作经历给加拿大带来的价值。其他国家的教育证书与加拿大颁发的学位、文凭和证书的一致性也可以这样说。最后，正如加拿大央行行长 Tiff Macklem 所建议的那样，审查和改变政府政策可能是为移民提供更好的语言和技能培训的第一步。	A review of current immigration and employment policy could help Canada better align foreign work experience with Canadian work experience, which would better enable employers in this country to recognize the value an immigrant brings with them to Canada through their international employment history. The same can be said for the alignment of educational credentials from other countries to degrees, diplomas and certificates awarded in Canada. Finally, as suggested by BoC Governor Tiff Macklem, reviewing and altering government policy may be the first step to providing immigrants with better language and skills training.
	
从理论上讲，这将有助于最大程度地减少加拿大雇主认为移民不适合/不适合在其组织中工作的偏见，从而有望改善所有加拿大移民的就业前景。	In theory, this would help minimize the biases among Canadian employers that immigrants are not suitable for/employable at their organizations, hopefully improving employment prospects for all immigrants to Canada.
