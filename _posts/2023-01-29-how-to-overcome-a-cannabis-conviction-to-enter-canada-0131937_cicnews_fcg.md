克服大麻定罪进入加拿大 先前涉及大麻的外国刑事定罪可能会使您无法进入该国。	Overcoming a cannabis conviction to enter Canada A prior, foreign criminal conviction involving cannabis can render you inadmissible to the country.
	
为了了解外国对大麻的定罪，您必须确定它们在加拿大法律中是否具有同等效力。一些在加拿大不再违法的外国定罪，例如持有数量有限的大麻，应该不是问题。	In order to understand foreign cannabis convictions, you must determine whether they have an equivalent in Canadian law. Some foreign convictions that are no longer illegal in Canada, such as possession of limited amounts of cannabis, should not be a problem.
	
但是，一些外国大麻指控或定罪可能会使一个人无法进入加拿大。最常见的是：	However, several foreign cannabis charges or convictions can render a person inadmissible to Canada. The most common are:
	
* 拥有超过 30 克干大麻（或其他形式的等同物）	  Possession of more than 30 grams of dried cannabis (or equivalent in other forms)
* 在大麻的影响下驾驶 (DUI)	  Driving under the influence (DUI) of cannabis
* 非法销售或分销大麻（严重犯罪，最高可判处 10 年监禁）	  The illegal sale or distribution of cannabis (serious criminality, punishable by up to 10 years in prison)
	
### 如何克服不可受理性	How to overcome inadmissibility
	
如果您想前往加拿大，可以通过三种主要方式来克服刑事入境问题：	There are three main ways to overcome criminal admissibility if you are looking to travel to Canada:
	
* 提交临时居留许可申请	  Submit a Temporary Resident Permit Application
* 提交刑事改造信	  Submit a Criminal Rehabilitation Letter
* 法律意见书	  Legal Opinion Letter
	
**临时居留许可（TRP）**	**Temporary Resident Permit (TRP)**
	
临时居留许可 (TRP) 是被视为犯罪不可入境的个人的一种选择，因为它允许在一段时间内临时进入加拿大。 TRP 只能在旅行者有正当理由进入加拿大的情况下使用，例如出于商业目的或紧急情况。他们入境的好处必须大于对加拿大社会的任何风险。	A Temporary Resident Permit (TRP) is an option for an individual considered criminally inadmissible as it grants temporary access to Canada for a certain period of time. A TRP should only be used in situations where a traveler has a valid reason for entering Canada, such as for business purposes or an emergency. The benefits of their entry must outweigh any risks to Canadian society.
	
根据入境原因，TRP 申请最多可获批三年。一个人可以随时申请 TRP，不需要完成刑事判决。 TRP 可以允许一次进入加拿大或允许多次重新进入加拿大。一旦进入加拿大，拥有 TRP 的个人可以申请延长许可证的期限。	A TRP application can be granted for up to three years, depending on the reason of entry. A person can apply for a TRP at any point and does not require the completion of a criminal sentence. A TRP can allow one entry to Canada or permit multiple re-entries. Once in Canada, an individual with a TRP may apply to extend the duration of the permit.
	
**刑事改造申请**	**Criminal Rehabilitation Application**
	
加拿大政府提供机会提交刑事康复申请，以永久清除您过去的犯罪历史，以便进入加拿大。刑事改造申请是一种一次性解决方案，与 TRP 不同，它不需要更新。如果个人获得刑事康复批准，他们将不再被视为不可入境，并且不需要 TRP 即可进入加拿大。	The Canadian Government offers the opportunity to submit a criminal rehabilitation application to permanently clear your past criminal history for the purposes of entering Canada. The criminal rehabilitation application is a one-time solution that, unlike a TRP, does not require renewal. If an individual is granted approval for criminal rehabilitation, they are no longer considered inadmissible and would not require a TRP for entry into Canada.
	
为了有资格获得刑事康复，您必须满足以下条件：	In order be eligible for criminal rehabilitation, you must meet the following criteria:
	
* 必须在加拿大境外实施相当于加拿大刑法规定的犯罪行为，	  Must have committed an act outside of Canada that would be equivalent to an offence under the Canadian Criminal Code,
* 必须已被定罪或承认犯有该行为，并且	  Must have been convicted of or admitted to committing the act, and
* 服刑期满五年。这包括入狱、罚款、社区服务或缓刑。	  Five years must have passed since the sentence has been completed. This includes jail time, fines, community service or probation.
	
**法律意见书**	**Legal Opinion Letter**
	
法律意见书是加拿大移民律师准备的文件，其中包含有关大麻定罪或指控的详细信息以及律师对该情况的法律意见。这封信将确定相关的加拿大法律，并提出不会使个人无法进入加拿大的替代违规行为。	A legal opinion letter is a document that a Canadian immigration lawyer prepares that contains details concerning a marijuana conviction or charge and the lawyer’s legal opinion on the situation. The letter would identify relevant Canadian law and suggest alternate infractions that would not render the individual inadmissible to Canada.
