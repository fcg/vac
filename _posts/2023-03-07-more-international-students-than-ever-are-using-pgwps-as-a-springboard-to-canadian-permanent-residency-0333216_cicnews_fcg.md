# 使用 PGWP 作为获得加拿大永久居留权的跳板的国际学生比以往任何时候都多 本文包含来自 2022 年加拿大统计局研究的数据，该研究收集了截至 2018 年的数据。	More international students than ever are using PGWPs as a springboard to Canadian permanent residency This article contains data from a 2022 Statistics Canada study that captures data up to 2018.
许多从符合条件的加拿大指定学习机构 (DLI) 毕业的国际学生利用毕业后工作许可 (PGWP) 计划来延长他们在加拿大的逗留时间，以便在这个国家工作和生活。	Many international students who graduate from eligible Canadian Designated Learning Institutions (DLIs) utilize the Post-Graduation Work Permit (PGWP) Program to extend their stay in Canada in order to work and build a life in this country.
	
注：根据加拿大政府的定义，DLI 是“经省或地区政府批准接收国际学生的学校”。	Note: As defined by the Canadian government, a DLI is “a school approved by a provincial or territorial government to host international students.”
	
事实上，在按年度毕业队列对 PGWP 持有人进行审查时，加拿大的 PGWP 持有人总数每年都在增加。根据这项研究，2008 届毕业生中有 29% 的人在五年后获得了 PGWP。 2009 年毕业班的这一数字又增加了 5%，并且还在继续稳步上升。 52% 的 2013 届毕业生在五年后获得了 PGWP。	In fact, in a review of PGWP holders by yearly graduation cohort, the total number of PGWP holders in Canada has risen every year. According to the study, 29% of graduates from the 2008 cohort held a PGWP five years later. That number rose an additional five percent for the 2009 graduating class and has continued rising steadily. The 2013 graduating cohort saw 52% of its graduates obtain a PGWP five years later.

进一步举例说明 PGWP 的增长，统计数据显示 2008 年至 2018 年间 PGWP 持有人总数增加了 528%（从 10,300 人增加到 64,700 人）。	Further exemplifying the growth of the PGWP, statistics show a 528% increase in the total number of PGWP holders between 2008 and 2018 (from 10,300 to 64,700).
	
### 为什么有更多的国际学生寻求 PGWP？	Why have more international students sought PGWPs?
	
值得注意的是，在撰写本文时，加拿大全国有超过 807,000 名持有有效学习许可的国际学生。	Notably, at the time of writing, Canada has over 807,000 international students holding valid study permits across the country.
	
根据加拿大统计局的数据，PGWP 普及率上升的原因有两个：PGWP 允许国际学生毕业生在加拿大谋生，并且它们是在加拿大获得永久居留权的宝贵工具。	According to data from Statistics Canada, the reason for the rising prevalence of the PGWP is two-fold: PGWPs allow international student graduates to make earn a living in Canada and they are a valuable tool for obtaining permanent residency in this country.
	
** 2008 年至 2018 年间 PGWP 持有人的收入中位数**	**Median earnings for PGWP holders up between 2008 and 2018**
	
在 2018 纳税年度，“具有正 T4 收入的有效 \[PGWP\] 持有人的平均收入”中值为 26,800 美元。 2008 年，这个数字仅为 14,500 美元（按 2018 年美元计算）。	In the 2018 tax year, the median average “earnings for valid \[PGWP\] holders with positive T4 earnings” was $26,800. In 2008, that figure was just $14,500 (in 2018 dollars).
	
适当地，现在整个加拿大的 PGWP 持有人的收入潜力大大增加，这证明了 PGWP 持有人随着时间的推移而增加。	Appropriately, there is now significantly greater earning potential for PGWP holders across Canada, giving credence to the rise in PGWP holders over time.
	
**注意：** 2008 年，所有省份 PGWP 持有人的最低收入中位数为 10,600 美元（魁北克）。 2008 年的最高收入记录在艾伯塔省，PGWP 持有者的平均收入中位数为 24,000 美元。 2018 年，这些数字分别激增至 23,200 加元（魁北克）和 32,000 加元（阿尔伯塔）。	**Note:** In 2008, the lowest median earnings for PGWP holders in any province was $10,600 (Quebec). 2008’s highest earnings were recorded in Alberta, where PGWP holders saw median average earnings of $24,000. Those numbers ballooned to $23,200 (Quebec) and $32,000 (Alberta), respectively, in 2018.
	
**PGWP 允许更多的国际学生成为加拿大的永久居民**	**PGWPs are allowing more international students to become permanent residents in Canada**
	
通过 PGWP，许可证持有人在完成学业后越来越能够过渡到成为加拿大永久居民 (PR)。	Through the PGWP, permit holders are increasingly becoming able to transition to becoming Canadian permanent residents (PRs) after completing their education.
	
PGWP 是国际学生从加拿大 DLI 毕业后在加拿大工作的主要途径。这些开放式工作许可证允许持有人为他们选择的任何加拿大雇主工作最多三年。	PGWPs are the main way for international students to work in Canada upon graduation from a Canadian DLI. These open work permits allow holders to work for any Canadian employer of their choice for a maximum of three years.
	
**注意：** PGWP 的实际长度将取决于许可证申请人毕业的高等教育课程的长度。	**Note:** The actual length of a PGWP will depend on the length of the post-secondary program from which the permit applicant graduated.
	
因此，通过 PGWP 获得的工作经验可以证明对未来的 PR 非常有益，因为这个国家的许多永久居民途径直接奖励拥有加拿大工作经验的候选人。	The work experience gained through a PGWP can thus prove very beneficial for prospective PRs, as many permanent resident pathways in this country directly reward candidates who possess Canadian work experience.
	
因此，PGWP 可以直接影响国际学生在加拿大获得永久居民身份的成功，进一步解释了该工作许可计划随着时间的推移越来越受欢迎。	Therefore, PGWPs can have a direct impact on the success that international students experience with acquiring permanent resident status in Canada, further explaining the increased popularity of this work permit program over time.
	
事实上，根据加拿大统计局的数据，“几乎四分之三的 PGWP 持有者在获得 PGWP 后的五年内成为永久居民”。	In fact, according to Statistics Canada’s data, “almost three-quarters of all PGWP holders became permanent residents within five years of having obtained their PGWP”.
	
尽管这些数字因获得不同教育证书（例如学士与硕士学位等）的 PGWP 持有者而异，但很明显，越来越多的加拿大国际学生现在正在使用 PGWPP 帮助他们从教育事业过渡到生活加拿大PR。	Although these numbers vary among PGWP holders who obtained different educational credentials (ex. bachelor’s vs master’s degree etc.), it is evident that an increasing number of Canadian international students are now using the PGWPP to help them transition from their educational career to life as a PR in Canada.
