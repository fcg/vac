整体财务健康最重要的部分之一是储蓄和规划您的未来目标。	One of the most important parts of overall financial health is saving and planning for your future goals.
	
对于刚到加拿大的新移民来说，这无疑是一个挑战。那些工作的生存工作可以证明简单地维持生计的困难。但是，采取措施反思_您为什么要存钱并制定储蓄目标_可以帮助您更接近实现这些目标。	That can certainly be challenging in a newcomer’s early days in Canada. Those working survival jobs can attest to the difficulty of simply making ends meet. However, taking steps to reflect _on what you’re saving money for and creating savings goals_ can help you come closer to realizing whatever those goals might be.
	
对于试图开始自己的职业生涯并为认证、教育或专业发展费用省钱的新加拿大人来说尤其如此。在加拿大，这些费用的总和很容易达到数千美元，这意味着您可以节省的任何金额都将帮助您更接近您的目标。	This is particularly true for new Canadians trying to launch their careers and save money for the costs of accreditation, education or professional development. In Canada, these costs can easily total in the thousands of dollars meaning any amount of financial savings you can engage in will help you get closer to your goal.

**要问自己的关键问题**	**Key questions to ask yourself**
	
Windmill Microlending 与 Prosper Canada 合作，确定了一些您可以问自己的有用问题，使您能够设定财务目标并跟踪实现这些目标的进度。这些包括：	Windmill Microlending, in partnership with Prosper Canada, has identified a number of helpful questions you can ask yourself to enable you to set your financial goals and track your progress toward reaching them. These include:
	
**你想存更多钱的原因是什么？_**	**_What are your reasons for wanting to save more money?_**
	
一些例子可能是教育、拥有房屋、退休、支付孩子的教育费用或为应急基金储蓄。	Some examples might be education, owning a home, retirement, paying for children’s education or saving for an emergency fund.
	
**_想想未来，你有什么希望和梦想？_**	**_Think further into the future, what hopes and dreams do you have?_**
	
想想您对生活、工作、教育和家庭的愿望可能会有所帮助。你可以考虑你想要什么样的工作；您想要居住的房屋类型或几年后您想要居住的地方。 Prosper 甚至鼓励您画图来帮助您形象化这些目标。	It may help to think about the wishes you have for your life, work, education and family. You may consider the kind of job you want; the kind of home you’ll want to be living in or where you want to be in a couple of years. Prosper even encourages you to draw a picture to help you visualize these goals.
	
**_为什么这个储蓄目标对你很重要？_**	**_Why is this savings goal important to you?_**
	
将目标与您的价值观联系起来可以帮助您为成功做好准备。	Connecting the goal to your values can help set you up for success.
	
**你想为你的目标存多少钱？_**	**_How much do you want to save toward your goal(s)?_**
	
考虑您可以为实现该目标节省多长时间以及何时使用这笔钱。	Consider how long you can save toward that goal and when you want to use the money.
	
**有哪些挑战可能会阻碍您实现储蓄目标？_**	**_What are some challenges that may get in the way of your savings goal?_**
	
反思你可以做些什么来准备和克服这些挑战。	Reflect on the things you can do to prepare for and overcome those challenges.
	
**_你多久检查一次你的储蓄？_**	**_How often will you check your savings?_**
	
有了这个问题，您应该考虑如何跟踪您实现财务目标的进度，并考虑您要养成什么样的储蓄习惯。例如，设置自动转账，将每张薪水的一小部分存入储蓄账户。其他人则使用四舍五入的借记卡，在每次购买时将金额四舍五入，并自动将多余的零钱转入他们的储蓄。同样，您可以请朋友或支持者帮助您朝着财务目标迈进。	With this question, you should consider how you’re going to track your progress toward your financial goal and consider what savings habits you’ll want to institute. For example, setting up automatic transfers to put a small part of each paycheque into a savings account. Others use a round-up debit card that rounds the amount up on every purchase and automatically transfers the spare change into their savings. As well, you could ask a friend or support person to help you stay on track towards your financial goals.
