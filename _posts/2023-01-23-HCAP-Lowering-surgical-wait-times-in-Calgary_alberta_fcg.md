艾伯塔省拥有世界上最优秀的一线医护人员，艾伯塔省政府正在努力确保艾伯塔人能够在需要的时间和地点获得所需的护理。	Alberta has the best front-line health-care workers in the world, and Alberta’s government is working to ensure that Albertans have access to the care they need, when and where they need it.

> “阿尔伯塔人，其中许多人都处于痛苦之中，他们等待卡尔加里改变生活的膝关节和髋关节手术的时间太长了。我们的医疗保健行动计划将加速在艾伯塔省的医院和特许手术设施增加更多手术，以将等待时间缩短至医学专家建议的等待时间。”	“Albertans, many of whom are in pain, are waiting too long for life-changing knee and hip surgeries in Calgary. Our Health Care Action Plan will accelerate adding more surgeries both at hospitals across Alberta and at chartered surgical facilities to bring down wait times to the waiting period recommended by medical experts.”

> “今天，我们朝着减少艾伯塔省人的手术等待时间迈出了重要一步，这是我们在 AHS 一直关注的四个优先领域之一。与特许手术设施提供者合作是帮助艾伯塔人更快获得所需手术的另一种策略。”	“Today, we take an important step toward reducing surgical wait times for Albertans, which is one of the four priority areas that we’ve been focused on at AHS. Working with chartered surgical facility providers is another strategy to help Albertans get the surgeries they need faster.”

减少手术等待时间被确定为 11 月发布的医疗保健行动计划的一个关键优先事项。为帮助实现这一目标，艾伯塔省政府正在从独立机构承包更多公共资助的手术。	Decreasing surgical wait times was identified as a key priority in the Health Care Action Plan, released in November. To help achieve this goal, Alberta’s government is contracting more publicly funded surgeries from independent facilities.

从本月开始，根据与艾伯塔省卫生服务部签订的新合同，Canadian Surgery Solutions 每年将提供 3,000 多个额外的髋关节和膝关节置换术以及其他关节手术。	Canadian Surgery Solutions will offer more than 3,000 additional hip and knee replacements and other joint procedures a year under a new contract with Alberta Health Services, starting this month.

> “这份合同将确保 AHS 继续改善许多艾伯塔人获得外科护理的机会。我们的团队一直在努力增加艾伯塔人的手术次数，以缩短手术等待时间。与 Canadian Surgery Solutions 等供应商合作将帮助我们实现这一目标。感谢我们的合作伙伴和 AHS 的所有团队，他们共同努力实现这一目标。”	“This contract will ensure AHS continues to improve access to surgical care for many Albertans. Our teams have been working hard to increase surgeries for Albertans, to bring down surgical wait times. Working with vendors such as Canadian Surgery Solutions will help us with this goal. Thank you to our partners and all of the teams at AHS who are working together to make this happen.”

> “这种伙伴关系展示了共同努力寻找解决方案以改善所有艾伯塔人获得骨科手术机会的价值。我们的手术室配备了最新技术，我们致力于为我们卡尔加里外科设施的所有患者提供最高质量的护理。”	“This partnership demonstrates the value of working together to find solutions to improve access to orthopedic surgeries for all Albertans. Our operating rooms are equipped with the latest technology, and we are committed to providing the highest quality of care for all the patients at our Calgary surgical facilities.”

医疗保健行动计划授权 AHS 官方管理员将手术等待时间缩短至临床推荐的时间。通过在未使用的手术室和特许手术设施中进行更多手术，艾伯塔人将更快地接受手术。	The Health Care Action Plan provides a mandate for the AHS official administrator to lower surgery wait times to clinically recommended times. By performing more surgeries in unused operating rooms and chartered surgical facilities, Albertans will receive their surgeries sooner.

> “许多在像这样的特许手术机构接受过手术的患者对特许手术机构的护理有积极的体验。我认为这是由于对患者体验的关注。我们知道，专门设施中的专注团队可以为患者带来出色的结果。”	“Many patients who have received surgery within a chartered surgical facility such as this have had a positive experience with the care within the chartered surgical facility. I think that is due to the attention on the patient experience. We know that a focused team in a dedicated facility can lead to excellent results for patients.”

目前，卡尔加里约有 6,000 人正在等待骨科手术。超过一半的人等待膝关节和髋关节置换术的时间超过了临床上合适的时间。与 2021-22 年相比，该合同将使在卡尔加里地区进行的骨科手术增加 21%。	Currently about 6,000 people in Calgary are waiting for orthopedic surgeries. More than half are waiting longer than the clinically appropriate time for knee and hip replacements. This contract will increase orthopedic procedures performed in the Calgary area by 21 per cent compared with 2021-22.

简化手术转诊	Streamlining surgery referrals

艾伯塔人现在可以通过一项新计划更快地获得整形外科医生和泌尿科医生的转诊 - 艾伯塔便利获得专业治疗 (FAST)。艾伯塔省的家庭医生和其他提供者可以将转诊信息发送给 FAST 中央团队，然后该团队将转诊信息分配给等待名单最短的专科医生。该全省计划从 8 月开始分阶段推出，此后已处理了 18,500 多例泌尿科医生或整形外科医生的转诊。	Albertans will now have quicker access to orthopedic surgeon and urologist referrals through a new program – the Alberta Facilitated Access to Specialized Treatment (FAST). Family doctors and other providers across Alberta can send referrals to the FAST central team, which then assigns the referral to a specialist with the shortest wait-list. The provincewide program was rolled out in phases starting in August and has since handled more than 18,500 referrals for a urologist or orthopedic surgeon.

增加医院的手术能力	Adding surgery capacity at hospitals

正在采取多项行动来提高医院的手术能力，包括延长主手术室手术室的使用时间。全省的医院都在增加新的手术室，包括卡尔加里、埃德蒙顿、埃德森、大草原城、莱斯布里奇、梅迪辛哈特和落基山之家。 2022 年预算在三年内拨款 1.33 亿美元用于扩建和建造手术室。将更多的骨科手术和程序转移到特许手术设施中，将释放医院的手术室空间，以提供更复杂的手术。	Several actions are underway to boost surgery capacity at hospitals, including extending main operating room surgical suite hours. New operating rooms are being added to hospitals across the province, including in Calgary, Edmonton, Edson, Grande Prairie, Lethbridge, Medicine Hat and Rocky Mountain House. Budget 2022 provides $133 million over three years to expand and build operating rooms. Moving more orthopedic surgeries and procedures into chartered surgical facilities will free up operating room space in hospitals to provide more complex surgeries.
