## _1) 建立说英语的练习例程。_	_1) Build a practice routine for speaking English._
	
尽可能多地练习英语口语听起来很简单，但这是提高英语口语技能的最佳方法。花时间与您的家人、朋友、同事以及您每天接触的任何人说英语。花点时间与杂货店的收银员进行简短交谈，或者在等公共汽车或火车时尝试与其他通勤者打破僵局。您获得的经验越多，您就会变得越自信！	Practicing your English speaking as much as possible may sound simple, but it is the best way to improve your spoken English skills. Take the time to speak English with your family, your friends, co-workers, and anyone else you interact with daily. Take a few moments to have a short conversation with the cashier at the grocery store or try breaking the ice with your fellow commuters while waiting for the bus or train. The more experience you gain, the more confident you will become!
	
## _2) 仔细按照测试说明进行操作。_	_2) Carefully follow the instructions of the test._
	
当需要参加 CELPIP 测试时，请仔细阅读每个提示的说明。您将有时间阅读和理解提示，并相应地整理您的想法。想一想你想在你的回答中解决的每一点，这样它就在你的脑海里是新鲜的。每个提示都会要求您在特定场景的背景下做出回应，因此您将能够想象自己处于那种情况下，无论您被要求谈论特定的经历，还是您对未来活动的计划。	When the time comes to take your CELPIP Test, read the instructions for each prompt carefully. You will be provided with time to read and understand the prompt, and to gather your thoughts accordingly. Think of each point you want to address in your response so that it is fresh in your mind. Each prompt will ask for a response in the context of a specific scenario, so you will be able to imagine yourself in that situation, whether you are being asked to speak about a specific experience, or about plans you have for a future activity.

## _3) 确保您对提示提供完整的答案。_	_3) Make sure you provide a complete answer to the prompt._
	
请务必向我们的评分员提供尽可能多的内容，以便评估您的口语水平。这意味着您应该尝试尽可能详细地阐述并提供问题的相关细节，同时保持主题。请记住使用所有分配的时间！	Be sure to give our raters as much content as you can so that your speaking proficiency can be assessed. This means that you should try to elaborate as much as possible and provide relevant details to the question, while staying on topic. Remember to use all your allotted time!
	
## _4) 在你的回答中使用你自己的生活经历。_	_4) Use your own life experiences in your responses._
	
当您回应提示时，请务必借鉴您自己的经验。讲述一个你经历过并且对你有意义的故事不仅比编造一些东西更容易，它会帮助你在你的回应中感到自信和放心。	When you are responding to a prompt, be sure to draw from your own experiences. Relating a story that you have lived through and that has meaning to you is not just easier than making something up, it will help you to feel confident and assured in your response.
	
## _5) 以自然的节奏和清晰的声音说话。_	_5) Speak at a natural pace and in a clear voice._
	
由于 CELPIP 测试的口语部分是使用麦克风耳机完成的，因此请确保您直接对着麦克风说话。在测试开始之前，您将能够测试您的录音设备，并聆听您自己的回答样本。花点时间找出最佳的音量、语速和语气来回答您的演讲提示。	Since the speaking component of the CELPIP Test is completed with a microphone headset, be sure that you are speaking directly into the microphone. Before your test begins, you will be able to test your recording device, and listen to a sample of your own response. Take this time to find the best volume, pace, and tone for replying to your speaking prompts.
	
## _6) 避免重复单词。_	_6) Avoid repeating words._
	
请记住：评分员正在倾听您使用各种单词和短语说英语的能力，因此请务必炫耀您的词汇量！不要完全重复提示中的单词，而是用您自己的话重新措辞。想想同义词和释义来表达你的想法。	Remember: the raters are listening for your ability to speak English using a wide range of words and phrases, so make sure to show off your vocabulary! Don’t repeat the words of the prompt exactly, and instead, rephrase them in your own words. Think of synonyms and paraphrases to express your thoughts.
	
## _7) 不要担心口音！_	_7) Don’t worry about accents!_
	
我们听到许多考生在说英语时担心自己的口音，但请记住，如果您使用良好的语法、丰富的词汇并彻底回答口语提示，您的口音将不会影响您的回答。评级。	We hear from many test takers that are concerned about their accent when speaking English, but please remember that if you are using good grammar, varied vocabulary, and are responding to the speaking prompts thoroughly, your accent will have no impact on how your response is rated.
	
## _8) 注意你的时间。_	_8) Keep an eye on your time._
	
在你开始回答你的口语任务之前，你将有准备时间来集思广益你的回答，并组织你的想法。屏幕上的计时器会告诉您需要准备多少时间，以及在记录时间到来时需要多少时间来完成回答。尽可能多地回答，但一定要在时间到之前说完。	Before you begin replying to your speaking tasks, you will be given preparation time to brainstorm your response, and to organize your thoughts. The timer on your screen will tell you how much time you have to prepare, and how much time you have to complete your response when the time comes to record. Use as much time in your response as you can, but be sure to finish speaking before the time is up.
