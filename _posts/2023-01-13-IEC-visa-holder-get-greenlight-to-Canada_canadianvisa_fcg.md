5 月 8 日宣布，在加拿大被迫关闭边境之前，根据 IEC 签证计划成功处理工作许可的申请人现在可以前往该国从事暑期工作、实习和短期专业合同。当您到达加拿大海关时，您将需要一份有效的工作邀请函和一份入境口岸介绍信。准备好在您抵达后进行为期两周的自我隔离。	It was announced on May 8th that applicants whose work permits were successfully processed under the IEC visa program before Canada was forced to close its borders, can now travel to the country for their summer jobs, internships and limited term professional contracts. You will need to have a copy of your valid job offer and a port of entry letter of introduction when you arrive at customs in Canada. Be prepared to go into self isolation for a period of two weeks following your arrival.
	
IEC 签证计划允许 18-35 岁的年轻人根据三个计划之一申请在加拿大工作	The IEC visa program allows youths, aged 18-35 years, to apply to work in Canada under one of three programs
	
* Working Holiday Visa - 开放式工作许可证发给希望游览该国的年轻旅行者，同时通过在农场、夏令营、度假村等工作赚钱以支持他们的旅行。	  Working Holiday Visa - an open work permit is issued to young travellers who want to see the country while making money along the way to support their travels by working on farms, summer camps, resorts and so on.
* 年轻专业人士 - 雇主特定工作许可证颁发给希望获得专业职位经验的年轻大学毕业生。根据您的工作机会签发最长 24 个月的签证	  Young Professionals - an employer specific work permit is issued to young college graduates who wish to gain experience in professional roles. Visas are issued for periods up to 24 months based on your job offer
* 国际合作社（实习）——雇主特定的工作许可证，授予在大学就读并获得工作机会以获得工作经验作为其学术课程一部分的人。	  International Co-op (internship) - an employer specific work permit granted to people enrolled in college with a job offer to gain work experience as part of their academic curriculum.
	
虽然 IRCC 目前不处理 IEC 申请，但他们会继续接受这些申请。随着企业寻求复苏并开始为冬季做计划，加拿大许多省份已经开始放宽封锁限制。随着在封锁期间被迫关闭的企业开始重新营业，IRCC 将处理申请，以便他们可以获得所需的劳动力。你开始计划你在加拿大的冬季工作经历了吗？	While the IRCC is not currently processing IEC applications, they are continuing to accept them. Many provinces in Canada have already begun to ease lockdown restrictions as businesses look to recover and begin planning for the winter season. As businesses that have been forced to close during the lockdown begin to re-open, the IRCC will process applications so that they can have the labour available to them that they need. Have you begun planning your winter working experience in Canada?
