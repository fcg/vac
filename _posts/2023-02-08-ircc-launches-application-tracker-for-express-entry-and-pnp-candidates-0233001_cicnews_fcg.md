IRCC 为 Express Entry 和 PNP 候选人启动了申请跟踪器 Express Entry 和 PNP 候选人现在将能够监控他们的申请，并随时了解他们个人资料的任何必要更新。	IRCC launches application tracker for Express Entry and PNP candidates Express Entry and PNP candidates will now be able to monitor their applications and stay informed of any necessary updates to their profiles.
	
加拿大移民难民和公民部 (IRCC) 宣布，他们正在将在线申请状态跟踪器扩展到四个新类别。这些状态跟踪器将允许客户监控他们的应用程序，并随时了解有关保持文件移动可能需要的操作的任何更新。	Immigration Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) has announced that they are expanding online application status trackers to four new categories. These status trackers will allow clients to monitor their application and stay informed on any updates regarding actions that may be required to keep their file moving.  
	  
新的状态跟踪器适用于联邦技术工人计划 (FSWP)、加拿大经验类移民 (CEC) 和联邦技术贸易计划 (FSTP) 的快速入境候选人。它还将适用于省提名计划 (PNP) 的候选人。	The new status trackers are for Express Entry candidates in the Federal Skilled Workers Program (FSWP), the Canadian Experience Class (CEC) and the Federal Skilled Trades Program (FSTP). It will also apply to candidates in Provincial Nominee Programs (PNPs).
	
快速通道和省提名计划是新移民最主要的两条经济移民途径中的两条。加拿大希望今年通过这两条途径共同欢迎近 190,000 名移民。到 2025 年，这个数字将上升到超过 230,000 名移民。	Express Entry and the Provincial Nominee Program are two of the two most prominent economic immigration pathways for newcomers. Canada is looking to welcome nearly 190,000 immigrants via the two pathways combined this year. This figure is set to rise to over 230,000 immigrants in 2025.
	
IRCC 的最新数据显示，截至 1 月 31 日，有 47,868 名 Express Entry 计划申请人在排队等候，而 PNP 有 66,214 名申请人在排队等候。	The most recent data from IRCC shows 47,868 applicants for Express Entry programs waiting in the queue as of January 31 and 66,214 for PNPs.
	
状态跟踪器旨在通过为客户提供比通过其他渠道联系 IRCC 更有效地直接访问信息来提高透明度。	Status trackers are meant to increase transparency by providing clients with direct access to information more efficiently than if they contacted IRCC through another channel.
	
新的在线状态跟踪器标志着 IRCC 为减少等待时间和改善访问信息所做的另一项努力。该部门表示，这是该部提高透明度承诺的一部分，并且在未来几个月内将对更多类型的申请提供申请状态跟踪。	The new online status trackers mark another effort by IRCC to reduce wait times and improve access information. The department says it is part of the ministry’s commitment to increase transparency and that application status tracking will be available for more types of applications in the coming months.
	
这是 IRCC 数字化战略的最新举措，将使申请人更容易访问他们的信息。整整一年前，IRCC 为家庭类永久居留申请人、担保人及其代表创建了状态跟踪器，以便更轻松地在线查看他们的申请状态。	This is the latest event in IRCC’s strategy to digitize and will make it easier for applicants to access their information. Exactly one year ago, IRCC created status trackers for family class permanent residence applicants, sponsors, and their representatives to check their application status online more easily.
