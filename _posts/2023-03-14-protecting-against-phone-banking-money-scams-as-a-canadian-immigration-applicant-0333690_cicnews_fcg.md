# 作为加拿大移民申请人，防止电话银行/金钱诈骗 财务安全是加拿大移民的重要组成部分。遵循这些提示以确保安全，避免成为电话银行/金钱诈骗的受害者。	Protecting against phone banking/money scams as a Canadian immigration applicant Financial security is a crucial part of Canadian immigration. Follow these tips to ensure safety against becoming victimized by a phone banking/money scam.
加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 将每年三月指定为欺诈预防月，以提高人们对影响加拿大移民生活的不同类型欺诈和诈骗的认识。	Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) designates every March as Fraud Prevention Month to bring awareness to different types of fraud and scams that impact the lives of Canadian immigrants.
	
鉴于这一目标，接下来将讨论加拿大电话银行诈骗日益普遍的情况，以及加拿大准移民和新移民可以采取哪些措施来帮助保护自己免受此类犯罪的侵害。	In light of that goal, what follows will discuss the rising prevalence of phone banking scams in Canada as well as what prospective and recent Canadian immigrants can do to help protect themselves against this type of crime.
	
### 加拿大电话银行诈骗的电话银行诈骗数量不断增加	Rising number phone banking scams of phone banking scams in Canada
	
根据 Global News 公布的加拿大反欺诈中心 (CAFC) 数据，自 2020 年以来，诈骗者冒充金融机构举报的诈骗电话数量增加了 1,600 多个。事实上，在 2019 年 1 月至 9 月 30 日期间，报告的电话数量为 1,147。这个数字在 2021 年增长到 2,212，然后比去年同期增长到 2,769。	According to Canadian-Anti-Fraud Centre (CAFC) data published by Global News, the number of fraudulent phone calls reported from scammers pretending to be a financial institution has risen by over 1,600 since 2020. In fact, between January and September 30 of 2019, the reported number of phone calls was 1,147. This number grew to 2,212 in 2021 and then 2,769 over the same time period last year.
	
对于潜在的和最近的加拿大移民来说，他们的财务安全通常不如已定居的加拿大人，金融诈骗尤其可怕。这在很大程度上是由于移民过程中对金钱的重视，包括在某些移民要求的背景下，如资金证明。	For prospective and recent Canadian immigrants, who are typically less financially secure than established Canadians, financial scams can be especially scary. This is due in no small part to the emphasis placed on money during the immigration process, including in the context of certain immigration requirements like proof of funds.
	
IRCC 要求移民申请人提供资金证明，因为这有助于“消除任何疑虑”，加拿大政府可能认为申请人可以在经济上支持自己（以及他们的家人，如果适用）。这对于某些加拿大移民项目的申请过程至关重要，包括那些由快速入境系统管理的项目。	IRCC requires immigration applicants to provide proof of funds because it helps “remove any doubt” the Canadian government may have that an applicant can financially support themselves (and their family, if applicable). This is vital to the application process of certain Canadian immigration programs, including those managed by the Express Entry system.
	
因此，准加拿大移民应特别注意保护自己的钱财，确保其不会落入骗子之手。加拿大新移民也是如此，他们比已经在该国定居的加拿大公民或永久居民更容易成为骗子的受害者。	Accordingly, prospective Canadian immigrants should take especially good care to safeguard their money and ensure it does not fall into the hands of a scammer. This is also true of recent Canadian immigrants, who are more likely to be victimized by scammers than Canadian citizens or permanent residents who have already established themselves in the country.
	
### 防止电话银行/金钱诈骗的提示	Tips for protecting against phone banking/money scams
	
随着加拿大电话银行诈骗的稳步增长，这三个技巧可以帮助防止加拿大移民成为围绕他们的钱的电话诈骗的受害者。	With the steady growth of phone banking scams in Canada, these three tips can help prevent Canadian immigrants from becoming victims of a phone scam surrounding their money.
	
**1\.如果不确定，请不要采取行动**	**1\. If unsure, don’t act**
	
当收到看起来很奇怪的电话或短信时，例如威胁如果没有交换金钱或撤销移民申请将采取法律行动，准移民和新移民不应立即采取任何行动。无论这意味着挂断电话还是根本不回复短信，处于这种情况的人在收到此类通讯时都应避免采取任何直接行动。	When receiving a call or a text that seems odd, such as one that threatens to pursue legal action if money does not exchange hands or to revoke an immigration application, prospective and recent Canadian immigrants should not take any immediate action. Whether that means hanging up the phone call or simply not responding to the text message, people in this situation should avoid taking any direct action when receiving communications like this.
	
**2\。不要向来电者提供敏感信息**	**2\. Don’t provide sensitive information to incoming callers**
	
准移民和新移民与所有加拿大人一样，应避免通过电话向来电者提供敏感信息。这是因为他们可能试图伪装成官方政府实体（例如 IRCC）或金融机构来诈骗电话的接收者。	Prospective and recent immigrants, much the same as all Canadians, should avoid providing sensitive information over the phone to incoming callers. This is because they may be attempting to pose as an official government entity (IRCC, for example) or financial institution to scam the recipient of the call.
	
事实上，IRCC“不会通过电话联系\[任何人\]......收取费用或罚款。”	In fact, IRCC “will not contact \[anyone\] … over the telephone to collect fees or fines.”
	
例如，如果有人不确定自称是银行的来电者的合法性，那么在拨出电话时直接致电金融机构是一个很好的开始。这样，来电者可以确信在解决任何潜在的财务问题之前，他们正在与合适的人交谈。	If, for instance, someone was unsure about the legitimacy of an incoming caller claiming to be the bank, calling the financial institution directly on an outgoing call is a good place to start. This way, the caller can be confident that they are speaking with the right people before addressing any potential financial concerns.
	
**3\。避免点击短信中的链接**	**3\. Avoid clicking on links in text messages**
	
短信诈骗通常会包含发件人用来尝试窃取敏感个人或财务信息的错误链接。敦促收到此类短信的人避免点击这些链接。相反，建议那些认为此类文本可能是真实的人通过他们经过验证的网站找到“发件人”的真实联系信息——因为这些诈骗短信通常看起来像是来自亚马逊或谷歌等合法公司——相应地联系他们。	Text message scams will often include faulty links that senders use to try and steal sensitive personal or financial information. Recipients of text messages like this are urged to avoid clicking on these links. Instead, those who believe a text of this kind may be real are advised to find the real contact information of the “sender” – as these scam text messages often look like they come from legitimate companies like Amazon or Google – through their verified website and contact them accordingly.
	
### 聘请移民律师如何提供帮助	How hiring an immigration lawyer can help
	
防止诈骗受害可能具有挑战性，因为很难知道该信任谁。	Protecting against scam victimization can be challenging because it is hard to know whom to trust.
	
为了进一步防范诈骗，请考虑聘请加拿大移民律师。这些律师必须注册为加拿大省或地区律师协会的会员才能在该国执业。因此，准加拿大移民在寻求加拿大移民律师的帮助时，可以确信他们正在获得值得信赖的帮助和建议。	For additional security against scams, consider hiring a Canadian immigration lawyer. These lawyers must be registered as a member of a Canadian provincial or territorial law society in order to practice in this country. Therefore, prospective Canadian immigrants can be confident that they are receiving trustworthy assistance and advice when they seek the help of a Canadian immigration lawyer.
