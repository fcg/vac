作为加拿大的新移民，您很快就会发现建立良好信用评分的重要性。	As a newcomer to Canada you will quickly find out the importance of building a good credit score.  
	
金融机构和其他企业通常会查看您的信用评分，以确定是否与您开展业务或“借给您”多少钱。这里有一些简单的例子：	Financial Institutions and other businesses will generally look at your credit score to determine whether to do business with you or how much money “to lend you”.  Here are some quick examples:
	
* 出租物业并有资格成为租户	  To rent a property and qualify as a tenant
	
* 申请信用卡	  Applying for a credit card
	
* 获得抵押贷款购买房屋	  Getting a mortgage to purchase a home

### **如何确定信用评分**	**How credit scores are determined**
	
您的信用评分取决于您的信用记录。每次您申请或获得信贷，每次您按时付款或不付款并使用您的信贷，您都在建立您的信用记录。	Your credit score is determined by your credit history. Every time you apply for or receive credit, and every time you make or don’t make a payment on time and use your credit you are building your credit history.
	
当您申请信贷时，您的金融机构将通过三种方式评估您的信用记录：	When you apply for credit, there are three ways your financial institution will evaluate your credit history:
	
* 回顾你过去与他们的交易；	  Review your past dealings with them;
	
* 考虑您在信用申请中提供的任何新信息；	  Consider any new information you provide in your credit application;
	
* 联系第三方信用机构获取关于您整体信用记录的报告。	  Contact a third-party credit agency for a report on your overall credit history.
	
信贷公司从向您提供信贷的公司收集信息。这会构建您的信用报告，它代表您与各种金融机构的活动摘要。	Credit companies collect information from the companies that provide the credit to you. This builds your credit report, which represents a summary of your activities with a variety of financial institutions.
	
定期向信用机构索取信用报告的详细信息是一种很好的做法，以帮助您了解您的评级并确保信息正确无误。这很重要，因为良好的信用记录可以增强您将来获得信贷的能力，而逾期付款或未付款等负面报告可能会使您将来更难借贷或获得信贷。	It is good practice to request the details of your credit report from the credit agencies periodically, to help you understand your rating and ensure that the information is correct. This is important because a strong credit record enhances your ability to get credit in the future, whereas negative reports such as overdue payments or non-payments, could make it more difficult for you to borrow or get credit in the future.
	
您在其他国家/地区的信用评分通常不会在加拿大使用。加拿大有两家公司收集信息并为您提供评分——其中一家是 EquifaxⓇ，另一家是 TransUnionⓇ。2	Your credit score from other countries will generally not be used in Canada. There are two companies in Canada that gather the information to provide you with a score – one of them is EquifaxⓇ and the other is TransUnionⓇ.2

### **什么是良好的信用评分？**	**What’s a good credit score?**
	
EquifaxⓇ 指出，加拿大良好的信用评分通常在 660 到 724 之间。如果您的信用评分在 725 到 759 之间，则可能被认为非常好。 760 及以上的信用评分通常被认为是优秀的信用评分。1 信用评分范围在 300 到 900.1 之间。您的分数越高，您的信用评级就越好。1	EquifaxⓇ notes that a good credit score in Canada is usually between 660 to 724. If your credit score is between 725 to 759 it’s likely to be considered very good. A credit score of 760 and above is generally considered to be an excellent credit score.1 The credit score range is anywhere between 300 to 900.1 The higher your score, the better your credit rating.1
	
您的信用评分有助于贷方评估您的信用能力。2您的信用评分越高，您获得贷款和信贷批准的可能性就越大。2在申请租房或申请某些工作时也可能会被检查。2但是，每个人的财务状况都不同，您的信用评分会根据您的信用记录和所欠债务的数额随时间发生变化。	Your credit score helps lenders to assess your credit capacity.2 The higher your score, the more likely you are to get approved for loans and credit.2 It may also be checked when applying to rent a property or when applying for certain jobs.2 However, everyone’s financial situation is different and your credit score will change over time based on your credit history and the amount of debt you owe.
	
### **这些公司收集哪些信息来确定我的信用评分？3**	**What information are these companies collecting to determine my credit score?3**
	
EquifaxⓇ 和加拿大政府注意到评估以下信息以确定您的信用评分：	EquifaxⓇ and the Government of Canada note the following information is assessed to determine your credit score:
	
* 您在还清借款方面的一致性如何。注意，开信用卡属于借钱，会被计入3	  How consistent you have been in paying off the money you have borrowed. Note that opening a credit card is considered borrowing money and will be taken into account3
	
* 银行或信用卡公司给你的信用额度与你已经用完的信用额度3	  The amount of credit that a bank or credit card company has given you versus how much you have used up3
	
* 您的信用记录的长度——这是您第一次到达时无法影响的事情，但越早开始建立您的信用越好3	  The length of your credit history – this is something you can’t impact when you first arrive but the earlier you start building your credit, the better3
	
* 您还应该避免在短时间内申请过多的贷款、拥有过多的信用卡和申请过多的信用检查。4 这是因为它也会对您的信用评分产生负面影响。 4	  You should also avoid applying for too many loans, having too many credit cards and requesting too many credit checks in a short timeframe.4 That’s because it could negatively impact your credit score too.4
	
### **如何建立良好的信用评分？**	**How do I build a good credit score?**
	
作为新移民，了解如何建立良好的信用评分很重要。有几种方法可以做到这一点：	As a newcomer, it is important to understand how to establish a good credit score.  There are several ways you can do so:
	
**1) 申请信用卡**	**1) Apply for a credit card **
	
TD 提供信用卡作为其 TD 加拿大新理财套餐的一部分。您必须申请并获得批准。拿到信用卡后，您就可以用它购物了。然后，您应该确保按时付款。越早开设第一张信用卡，您开始建立信用记录的速度就越快。	TD offers a credit card as part of its TD New to Canada Banking Package. You have to apply and be approved for it. Once you get your credit card, you can make purchases with it. You should then make sure to pay your payments on time. The earlier you open your first credit card, the faster you will start building your credit history.
	
**2) 获取手机或互联网服务计划**	**2) Get a cell phone or internet service plan**
	
某些移动或互联网计划需要信用检查才能开通。获得手机或互联网服务计划后，请确保按时支付账单。此外，并非所有移动公司都会向信用局报告您的每月付款。你应该问他们是否这样做。	Some mobile or internet plans require a credit check to open.  Once you get a cell phone or internet service plan, make sure you pay your bills on time. Also, not all mobile companies report your monthly payments to the credit bureau.  You should ask if they do.
	
**3) 其他形式的债务**	**3) Other forms of debt**
	
如果您碰巧租车，及时还款可以计入良好的信用评分。这同样适用于学生贷款、抵押贷款或任何其他形式的贷款——这都是建立您及时偿还欠款历史的一部分。	If you happen to be leasing a car, the payments on a timely basis could count towards a good credit score.  The same would apply to a student loan, mortgage, or any other form of loan – it’s all part of establishing a history of you paying back money that you owe in a timely manner.
	
**4) 预算帮助**	**4) Budgeting Helps**
	
无论您从上述示例中获得的信用类型是什么——要获得更高的信用评分，您必须按时付款。这样做的方法之一是确保您的预算适当。如果您在制定预算方面需要帮助，TD 可以随时随地使用 TD App 或通过易线网上理财帮助您管理资金。	Regardless of the type of credit you have taken out from the examples above – to get a higher credit score you must be making payments on time.  One of the ways of doing this is to make sure that you budget properly.  If you need help with creating budgets, TD can help you manage your money from wherever you are with the TD App or online banking through EasyWeb.
