回答有关新永久居民在加拿大医疗保健的六个常见问题这是新加拿大永久居民的入门读物，其中包含有关加拿大医疗保健的一些最常见问题的答案。	Answering six common questions about healthcare in Canada for new permanent residents This a primer for new Canadian PRs containing answers to a few of the most common questions about healthcare in Canada.
	
新登陆的加拿大永久居民 (PR) 享有与在该国出生和长大的公民相同的医疗保健服务。	Newly landed Canadian permanent residents (PR) are afforded the same healthcare services as citizens born and raised in this country.
	
以下是新加拿大人对加拿大医疗保健提出的一些最常见问题的解答。	Here are answers to some of the most common questions new Canadians have about healthcare in Canada.
	
### 加拿大的医疗保健是免费的吗？	Is Canadian healthcare free?
	
这个国家的医疗保健是通过所有加拿大公民和永久居民每年缴纳的税款来资助的。在大多数情况下，所有加拿大人在使用医疗服务时都是免费的，但某些药物（例如处方药）和治疗需要接受者自付费用。	Healthcare in this country is funded through the taxes that all Canadian citizens and PRs pay annually. In most cases, health services are free for all Canadians at the point of use, although certain medications (ex. prescription drugs) and treatments will require the recipient to pay out of pocket.
	
为清楚起见，加拿大政府在网上指出，虽然加拿大的医疗保健是公共资助的，但“药店\[来自\]的药物不是免费的。 \[公共健康保险通常\]不会涵盖药物治疗，因此您可能需要自己支付费用。您也可能有资格通过其他保险或药物计划获得保险。”	For clarity, the Canadian government notes online that while healthcare in Canada is publicly funded, “medications \[from\] a pharmacy are not free. \[Public health insurance often\] won’t cover medication, so you may have to pay for it yourself. You also may be eligible for coverage through another insurance or drug program.”
	
### 我如何让自己加入医疗保健系统？我需要健康卡吗？如果是这样，我可以从哪里得到一个？需要多长时间才能到达？	How do I induct myself into the healthcare system? Do I need a Health Card? If so, where can I get one from? How long does it take to arrive?
	
所有加拿大公民和永久居民都需要健康卡才能获得加拿大的医疗保健服务。该文件将向医生或医疗专业人员证明健康卡持有人已在其省或地区的医疗保健系统中注册。	All Canadian citizens and Permanent Residents need a health card to access healthcare services in Canada. This document will verify to a doctor or medical professional that the health card holder is registered with the healthcare system in their province or territory.
	
健康卡的申请流程因地区而异，加拿大各省和地区之间没有共享流程。例如，在安大略省获得健康卡需要申请人亲自前往安大略省服务中心。同时，艾伯塔省允许健康卡申请人亲自或邮寄申请。健康卡的处理时间也因省/地区而异。	The application process for a health card varies by region, and there is no shared process used among the provinces and territories across Canada. For example, obtaining a health card in Ontario will require the applicant to visit a Service Ontario location in person. Meanwhile, Alberta allows health card applicants to apply in person or by mail. Health card processing times also vary by province/territory.

### 我什么时候有资格享受公共医疗保健？	When am I eligible for public health care?
	
在加拿大，健康卡为持有人提供其居住省份的公共健康保险和适用健康服务的财务保障。这些通常是基本和紧急护理服务，例如医院。	In Canada, a health card provides the holder with access to public health insurance in their province of residence and financial coverage for applicable health services. These are typically basic and emergency care services such as the hospital.
	
在某些情况下，在成为加拿大永久居民后不会立即获得公共健康保险的资格。相反，一些省份和地区要求公共健康保险申请人最多等待三个月才能开始享受福利。	Eligibility for public health insurance does not, in some cases, happen immediately after becoming a PR in Canada. Instead, some provinces and territories require public health insurance applicants to wait up to three months for their benefits to begin.
	
以下列出了各省/地区公共医疗保险的等待时间：	The following lists the wait times for public health insurance coverage in each province/territory:
	
**不列颠哥伦比亚省 (BC)：** 2 个月 + 首次在该省居住后的任何剩余时间	**British Columbia (BC):** 2 months + any remainder of the month after residence in province is first established
	
**艾伯塔省 (AB)：** 3 个月	**Alberta (AB):** 3 months
	
**安大略省（ON）：** 无等待期	**Ontario (ON):** No waiting period
	
**爱德华王子岛 (PEI)：** 3 个月	**Prince Edward Island (PEI):** 3 months
	
**魁北克 (QC)：** 最多 3 个月	**Quebec (QC):** Up to 3 months
	
**马尼托巴省 (MB)：** 最多 3 个月	**Manitoba (MB):** Up to 3 months
	
**萨斯喀彻温省 (SK)：** 3 个月	**Saskatchewan (SK):** 3 months
	
**新不伦瑞克 (NB)：** 3 个月	**New Brunswick (NB):** 3 months
	
**新斯科舍省 (NS)：** 3 个月	**Nova Scotia (NS):** 3 months
	
**纽芬兰和拉布拉多 (NL)：** 无等待期	**Newfoundland and Labrador (NL):** No waiting period
	
**努纳武特 (NU)：** 3 个月	**Nunavut (NU):** 3 months
	
**西北地区 (NWT)：** 3 个月	**Northwest Territories (NWT):** 3 months
	
**育空地区 (YU)：** 3 个月	**Yukon (YU):** 3 months
	
### 私人医疗保险呢？我需要两者吗？	What about private health insurance? Do I need both?
	
除了公共医疗保健之外，私人医疗保险也可能有益的原因有很多。	On top of public healthcare, there are several reasons that private health insurance may also be beneficial.
	
私人健康保险有益的第一个原因是上面提到的，即加拿大对公共健康保险施加的等待期。在这种情况下，私人健康保险将在等待期间为个人的医疗保健需求提供保障。此外，私人健康保险将使被保险人能够满足公共保险通常无法满足的需求。这些包括牙科工作和访问某些医学专家，如手足病医生（足部）。	The first reason that private health insurance is beneficial is what is noted above, the waiting period imposed on public health insurance in Canada. In this case, private health insurance would provide coverage for an individual’s healthcare needs during the waiting period. Additionally, private health insurance would allow insured persons to be covered for needs that are not usually handled by public insurance. These include things like dental work and visits to certain medical specialists such as a chiropodist (foot).
	
### 我应该找家庭医生吗？如何找到？	Should I get a family doctor and how do I find one?
	
家庭医生，也称为全科医生或家庭医生，是许多加拿大人在需要医疗护理时会拜访的基本保健提供者。尽管人们可以根据医疗需要前往步入式诊所和医院（用于紧急护理），但由于预约时间安排和护理的连续性，家庭医生是许多加拿大人的首选。换句话说，家庭医生通过提前安排预约并提供一致的护理体验，让患者避免排队等候，因为患者每次预约都会见同一位医生。	Family doctors, also called general practitioners or family physicians, are basic health providers that many Canadians visit when they need medical care. Although there are walk-in clinics and hospitals (for urgent care) that people can visit for medical needs, a family doctor is the preferred choice of many Canadians due to appointment scheduling and the continuity of care. In other words, family doctors allow patients to avoid waiting in lines by scheduling appointments in advance and providing a consistent care experience because the patient will meet with the same doctor for every appointment.
	
在加拿大寻找家庭医生可能是一段漫长的旅程，因为家庭医生通常会在任何特定时间自行决定是否要接受新患者。寻找家庭医生的一个很好的起点是朋友和家人的推荐，或者从安居服务提供商那里获得帮助。	Finding a family doctor in Canada can be a long journey because family doctors often decide for themselves whether they want to accept new patients at any given time. A good starting point for finding a family doctor would be recommendations from friends and family or getting help from a settlement services provider.
	
通常，在线搜索当地的家庭医生（使用邮政编码）也会返回靠近某人居住地的不同家庭医生的结果。从那里，对特定家庭诊所网站的审查通常会显示该诊所的医生是否正在接受新患者。打电话给诊所询问医生什么时候有空，然后去见那位医生，可以快速开始为新的加拿大永久居民寻找家庭医生的旅程。	Oftentimes, an online search of family doctors in a local area (using a postal code) will also return results of different family doctors close to where someone lives. From there, a review of the website for a given family clinic will usually reveal if a doctor at that clinic is accepting new patients. Calling the clinic and asking when that doctor is available, then going in to meet with that doctor, can jumpstart the journey toward finding a family doctor for new Canadian PRs.

### 当我需要在紧急情况下去看医生/医院时会发生什么？我必须携带哪些文件？我可以走进去吗？	What happens when I need to visit a doctor/hospital in an emergency? What are the documents I must have with me? Can I just walk in?
	
当一个人遇到医疗紧急情况时，他们需要到最近医院的急诊室就诊。所有患者都必须随身携带健康卡和个人身份证件。走进医院后，员工将根据患者病情的严重程度为患者提供进一步的指导，最终患者将由医生接诊。	When a person is experiencing a medical emergency, they need to visit the emergency department at the nearest hospital. It is important for all patients to bring their health cards and personal ID with them. Upon walking into the hospital, an employee will provide further direction to the patient based on the severity of their condition and the patient will eventually be seen by a doctor.
