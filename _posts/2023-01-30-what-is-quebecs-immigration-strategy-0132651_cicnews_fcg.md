魁北克的移民策略是什么？魁北克有自己的移民程序，有不同的项目和选择标准。	What is Quebec’s immigration strategy? Quebec has its own immigration process, with distinct programs and selection criteria.
	
由于其独特的法语国家地位，魁北克拥有比加拿大任何其他省份和地区更多的移民权力。加拿大宪法规定移民属于联邦和省级管辖范围，但联邦政府在移民方面发挥主导作用。 1968 年，魁北克成立了自己的移民部。	Quebec has more immigration authority than any other province and territory in Canada due to its unique francophone status. The Canadian Constitution states that immigration falls under both federal and provincial jurisdiction, but the federal government plays a leading role in immigration. In 1968, Quebec launched its own immigration ministry.
	
魁北克获得了根据自己的标准和程序设定自己的移民目标和选择移民的权力。它是唯一一个在经济录取途径中完全控制录取的省份。在该国其他地区，联邦政府负责通过经济途径选择候选人，并有自己的选择标准和排名系统。最终，无论移民途径如何，联邦政府对进入该国拥有最终决定权。	Quebec obtained the power to set its own immigration targets and select immigrants according to its own criteria and procedures. It is the only province that has total control over admission in the economic admissions pathway. In the rest of the country, the federal government is responsible for selecting candidates through economic pathways with its own selection criteria and ranking system. Ultimately, the federal government has the final decision on admissions into the country, regardless of the immigration pathway.
	
为了移民到魁北克，候选人必须首先向省政府提出申请。该省将根据自己的规则和标准评估候选人。如果被选中，候选人将获得魁北克移民部颁发的魁北克选择证书 (CSQ)。一旦获得 CSQ，候选人才能向加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 申请永久居留权。	In order to immigrate to Quebec, a candidate must first apply to the provincial government. The province will assess the candidate based on their own rules and critiera. If selected, the candidate will obtain a Certificat de selection du Quebec (CSQ), issued by the Quebec Ministry of Immigration. Once issued a CSQ, only then will the candidate be able to apply to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) for permanent residence.
	
###移民目标	Immigration targets
	
移民、法兰西化和融合部发布了 2023 年魁北克移民计划，概述了该省今年的移民目标。该计划指出，他们预计到 2023 年将有 49,500 至 52,500 人进入该省。	The Ministry of Immigration, Francisation and Integration released the 2023 Quebec Immigration Plan outlining the province’s immigration targets for the year. The plan states that they expect to admit between 49,500 and 52,500 people to the province in 2023.
	
经济类新人占比最大，具体目标为3.39万人，占新人的65%以上。在这一类别中，魁北克预计将迎来多达 29,500 名技术工人和多达 4,300 名商业移民，其中包括个体经营者、投资者和企业家。	The economic category will represent the largest proportion of newcomers, specifically a target of 33,900 people, making up over 65% of newcomers. Within this category, Quebec expects to welcome up to 29,500 skilled workers and up to 4,300 business immigrants, which include the self-employed, investors and entrepreneurs.
	
魁北克还希望在 2023 年通过家庭团聚欢迎 10,200 至 10,600 名新移民，以及 6,900 至 7,500 名难民和处于类似情况的人。	Quebec also hopes to welcome between 10,200 and 10,600 newcomers through family reunification and between 6,900 and 7,500 refugees and people in similar situations in 2023.
	
### 法语移民	Francophone immigrants
	
魁北克执政党 Coalition Avenir Quebec (CAQ) 的主要关注点之一是保护该省的法语。为此，该省希望根据已经讲法语的经济移民计划选择移民来魁北克。	One of the main focuses of the governing party in Quebec, the Coalition Avenir Quebec (CAQ), is to protect the French language in the province. In an attempt to do so, the province hopes to select immigrants coming to Quebec under economic immigration programs that already speak French.
	
2022 年 11 月，魁北克省省长弗朗索瓦·勒戈 (Francois Legault) 在魁北克国民议会发表演讲，讨论了法语移民对该省的重要性。他表示，到 2026 年，他希望要求所有魁北克经济移民都讲法语。	Francois Legault, the Premier of Quebec, made a speech at the National Assembly of Quebec in November 2022, where he discussed the importance of Francophone immigration to the province. He stated that by 2026, he would like to require all Quebec economic immigrants to be francophone.
	
### 如何移民到魁北克	How to immigrate to Quebec
	
有多种方式可以移民到魁北克，包括技术工人途径、家庭赞助和商人的选择。	There are various ways to immigrate to Quebec, including skilled worker pathways, family sponsorship and options for businesspeople.
	
魁北克在选择技术工人移民时特别强调法语知识，但即使不会说法语也可以满足魁北克移民项目的要求。	Quebec places special emphasis on knowledge of French when selecting skilled worker immigrants, but it is possible to meet the requirements for Quebec’s immigration programs without speaking French.
	
魁北克的经济移民项目包括魁北克技术工人项目（QSWP）和魁北克经验项目（PEQ）。 QSWP 适用于希望成为加拿大永久居民并居住在魁北克的外国技术工人。对于在该省具有合格工作经验的技术工人和拥有魁北克高等教育机构合格文凭的国际学生来说，PEQ 是一个受欢迎的选择。	Quebec’s economic immigration programs include the Quebec Skilled Worker Program (QSWP) and the Quebec Experience Program (PEQ). The QSWP is for foreign skilled workers who want to become permanent residents of Canada and reside in Quebec. The PEQ is a popular option for skilled workers with eligible work experience in the province and for international students with an eligible diploma from a Quebec post-secondary institution.
	
Arrima 是魁北克政府用来管理技术工人申请的在线平台。它创建于 2018 年，旨在增加移民申请的处理速度，并根据各省的劳动力市场需求协调移民候选人。希望移民到魁北克的候选人可以创建个人资料，如果符合条件，则会分配一个分数并与池中的其他候选人进行排名。候选人由意向书 (EOI) 系统选出。	Arrima is the online platform used by the Quebec government to manage skilled worker applications. It was created in 2018 to increase processing of immigration applications and coordinate immigration candidates with the provinces’ labor market needs. Candidates who wish to immigrate to Quebec can create a profile and if eligible, are assigned a score and ranked against other candidates in the pool. Candidates are selected by the Expression of Interest (EOI) system.
	
一个人可能有资格通过家庭类担保移民到魁北克。如果此人有居住在魁北克的配偶或同居伴侣，则该配偶或伴侣可以担保他们与他们同住。如果此人是居住在魁北克的人的受抚养子女或祖父母，他们也可能有资格获得赞助。	A person may be eligible for immigration to Quebec through family class sponsorship. If the person has a spouse or common law partner who lives in Quebec, that spouse or partner may sponsor them to come live with them. If the person is a dependent child or grandparent of someone who lives in Quebec, they may also be eligible for sponsorship.
	
赞助商必须签署一份“承诺书”，使他们对他们希望赞助的家庭成员负有法律责任，并且可能需要证明他们有支持家庭成员所需的收入。魁北克担保人的承诺期限和收入要求与该国其他地区的这些要求不同。	The sponsor must sign an “undertaking” making them legally responsible for the family member they wish to sponsor and may be required to show they have the required income to support the family member. The length of an undertaking and the income requirements for a sponsor in Quebec differs from these requirements in the rest of the country.
	
### 如何在魁北克获得工作许可和学生许可	How to get a work permit and student permit in Quebec
	
加拿大有两种类型的工作许可计划：	There are two types of work permits programs in Canada:
	
* 临时外国工人计划：外国工人需要进行劳动力市场影响评估 (LMIA) 才能获得工作许可	  Temporary Foreign Worker Program: A Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) is required for the foreign worker to obtain a work permit
* 国际流动计划：外籍工人无需 LMIA 即可获得工作许可	  International Mobility Program: an LMIA is not required for a foreign worker to obtain a work permit
	
LMIA 的目的是证明雇用外国工人不会对加拿大的劳动力市场产生负面影响。虽然 LMIA 过程很常见，但有许多不同的 LMIA 豁免工作许可。	The purpose of an LMIA is to demonstrate that the hiring of a foreign worker will not have a negative impact on Canada’s labor market. Although the LMIA process is common, there are many various LMIA-exempt work permits.
	
魁北克省有自己的工作许可要求。魁北克有自己的职业清单，可以加快 LMIA。为了获得工作许可证，除了 LMIA 外，外籍工人还需要获得一份名为 Certificat d’Acceptation du Quebec (CAQ) 的文件。	The province of Quebec has their own work permit requirements. Quebec has its own list of occupations that allow for an expedited LMIA. In order to get a work permit, the foreign worker is required to obtain a document called a Certificat d’Acceptation du Quebec (CAQ) in addition to an LMIA.
	
与工作许可程序类似，为了在魁北克获得学生许可，未来的学生如果希望在该省学习，还必须获得 CAQ。	Similar to the work permit process, in order to obtain a student permit in Quebec, the prospective student must also obtain a CAQ if they wish to study in the province.
	
只有获得 CAQ，外国工人或学生才能向加拿大移民、难民和公民部提交工作或学习许可申请。	Only once the CAQ is obtained can the foreign worker or student submit the work or study permit application to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada.
