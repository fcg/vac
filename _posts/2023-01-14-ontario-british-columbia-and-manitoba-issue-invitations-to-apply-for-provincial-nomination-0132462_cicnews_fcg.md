Through these programs, interested candidates may be invited to apply for provincial nomination. Receiving a provincial nomination can be advantageous for gaining permanent residence.

省提名计划 (PNP) 每年有 105,000 名永久居民。它始于 1998 年，此后每年 PNP 录取人数稳步增长。联邦和省政府都认为这是促进城市中心以外地区经济发展的有效工具。	The Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) accounts for 105,000 PR admissions per year. It began in 1998 and the annual number of PNP admissions has since increased steadily.
