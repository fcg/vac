!加拿大的劳动力调查显示就业机会增加	!Canada’s Labour Survey Shows An Increase in Job Availability
	
根据加拿大统计局周五发布的最新劳动力调查报告，加拿大经济在年底前创造了新的就业机会。该国上个月还增加了 104,000 个工作岗位，将当月的失业率降至 5.0%。这低于 11 月份的 5.1%，仅略高于 6 月份 4.9% 的历史低点。	According to Statistics Canada's latest labour force survey report released on Friday, the Canadian economy experienced a jump in new job creation by the end of the year. The country also gained 104,000 jobs last month, lowering the unemployment rate to 5.0% for the month. This is down from 5.1% in November and barely above the June record low of 4.9%.
	
加拿大的就业增长	Employment Growth in Canada
	
15 至 24 岁的青年就业人数增幅最大，抵消了该群体 7 月至 9 月的整体损失。	Youth between the ages of 15 and 24 saw the largest rise in employment, offsetting the group's overall losses from July to September.
	
虽然公共部门的雇员人数保持不变，但私营部门的雇员人数有所增加。包括运输和仓储以及建筑在内的一些行业的就业人数普遍增加。	While it remained constant in the public sector, the number of employees rose in the private sector. Several businesses, including transportation and warehousing, as well as construction, had widespread increases in employment.
	
2022 年 12 月，萨斯喀彻温省、安大略省、阿尔伯塔省、不列颠哥伦比亚省、马尼托巴省以及纽芬兰和拉布拉多省的就业人数有所增长。然而，其他省份的变化很小。	In December 2022, employment grew in Saskatchewan, Ontario, Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, and Newfoundland and Labrador. However, the other provinces saw minimal change.
	
人口结构方面，12月青年男性就业率达到57.8%，为2019年4月以来的最高水平。同时，12月青年女性就业率上升。	Regarding demographics, young men's employment rate reached 57.8% in December, the highest level since April 2019. At the same time, employment among young women rose in December.
	
全职就业人数在 12 月份连续第三个月增加，是就业增长的主要因素。对于截至 2022 年 12 月的年度，就业增长同样主要由全职工作推动。	Full-time employment, which increased for a third consecutive month in December, was the primary factor in the employment growth. For the year ending in December 2022, employment growth was similarly driven mainly through full-time work.
	
此外，尽管整体就业人数增加，但每月总工作时数同比增长 1.4%。	Additionally, the total monthly hours worked increased by 1.4% year on year despite the increase in overall employment.
	
### 混合工作	Hybrid Work
	
有趣的是，大约 10% 的员工有混合工作安排。 9.6% 的员工在 12 月有混合时间表，因此他们经常在家里和其他地方工作之间分配时间。这比 2022 年 1 月上升了 6.0 个百分点，但与 11 月报告的水平几乎没有变化。经常在家工作的员工比例在 12 月份为 15.8%，没有变化	Interestingly, about 10% of workers had a hybrid work arrangement. 9.6% of employees had a hybrid schedule in December, so they often split their time between working from home and elsewhere. This was up 6.0 percentage points from January 2022 but barely changed from the level reported in November. At 15.8% in December, the percentage of workers who often work just from home showed no change
	
因病缺勤增加	Increase of Absenteeism due to Illness
	
限制工作时间的原因之一是，在该机构截至 12 月中旬的参考期内，8.1% 的员工因病或残疾缺勤。这一发现发生在加拿大各地的呼吸系统疾病浪潮中，COVID-19、RSV 和流感使该国的医疗保健系统不堪重负。	One reason restricting working hours was that 8.1% of employees were absent from work owing to illness or disability during the agency's reference period, which ended in mid-December. The findings occurred amid a wave of respiratory sickness across Canada, with COVID-19, RSV, and flu straining the country's health-care system.
	
因病缺勤的发生率已从 11 月的 6.8% 增加到 2017-2019 年 12 月记录的大流行前平均水平 6.9%，但仍低于 2022 年 1 月因 Omicron 变体肆虐而创下的 10.0% 的历史新高加拿大劳动力。	The incidence of illness-related absences has increased from 6.8% in November to the pre-pandemic average of 6.9% recorded in December 2017-2019, although it remains below the record-high of 10.0% seen in January 2022 as the Omicron variant ravaged the Canadian labor force.
	
失业率下降	Unemployment Rate Decreases
	
12 月失业率降至 5.0%。这是四个月内的第三次下降，目前略高于 6 月和 7 月创下的 4.9% 的历史低点。	The unemployment rate fell to 5.0% in December. This was the third drop in four months, and the rate is now slightly above the record low of 4.9% set in June and July.
	
平均时薪同比增长 5.1%，连续第 8 个月涨幅超过 5%，但低于通胀水平。	Average hourly salaries increased by 5.1% year on year, marking the eighth consecutive month wage growth over 5% but falling short of inflation.
	
按行业和省份分列的就业增长	Employment Increase by Industry and Province
	
12月建筑业从业人员增加3.5万人。四个省份出现增长，其中安大略省（增长 2.7%）和艾伯塔省（增长 5.8%）居首。根据加拿大统计局最新的统计数据，10 月份全国新建筑投资增长了 0.2%，其中安大略省几乎占了所有的增长。	In December, the number of construction workers increased by 35,000. Increases were seen in four provinces, headed by Ontario (up 2.7%), and Alberta (up 5.8%). According to the most recent Statistics Canada statistics, national investment in new construction increased by 0.2% in October, with Ontario accounting for virtually all of the gains.
