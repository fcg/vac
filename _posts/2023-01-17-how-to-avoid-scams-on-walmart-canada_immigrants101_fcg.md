However, like any other online shopping platform, it is not immune to scams. From fake deals to phishing scams, there are various ways that scammers can trick shoppers into giving away their money or personal information. In this blog post, we’ll explore some of the most common Walmart Canada scams and share tips on how to protect yourself.
	
虚假交易：	Fake Deals:
	
加拿大沃尔玛最常见的骗局之一是虚假交易。这些是在加拿大沃尔玛网站上宣传的优惠，但实际上无法购买。它们经常被用来诱骗购物者以比他们通常支付的价格高得多的价格购买产品。为避免成为此骗局的受害者，您应谨慎对待好得令人难以置信的交易，并经常查看其他在线零售平台上的产品价格。	One of the most common scams on Walmart Canada is fake deals. These are deals that are advertised on the Walmart Canada website, but they are not actually available for purchase. They are often used to trick shoppers into paying for products at a much higher price than they would normally pay. To avoid falling victim to this scam, you should be cautious of deals that are too good to be true, and always check the price of the product on other online retail platforms.
	
网络钓鱼诈骗：	Phishing Scams:
	
网络钓鱼诈骗是加拿大沃尔玛的另一种常见诈骗形式。这些是伪造的电子邮件或消息，看起来像是来自加拿大沃尔玛，但实际上它们来自试图窃取您的个人信息的诈骗者。为避免成为此骗局的受害者，除非您确定电子邮件或消息来自加拿大沃尔玛，否则切勿点击链接或输入您的个人信息。	Phishing scams are another common form of scam on Walmart Canada. These are fake emails or messages that are designed to look like they are from Walmart Canada, but they are actually from scammers trying to steal your personal information. To avoid falling victim to this scam, you should never click on links or enter your personal information unless you are certain that the email or message is from Walmart Canada.
	
未经授权的信用卡收费：	Unauthorized Credit Card Charges:
	
另一个需要注意的骗局是未经授权的信用卡收费。当骗子使用您的信用卡信息在加拿大沃尔玛进行未经授权的购买时，就会发生这种情况。为避免成为此骗局的受害者，您应该密切关注您的信用卡账单，并立即向您的银行或加拿大沃尔玛报告任何可疑费用。	Another scam to be aware of is unauthorized credit card charges. This happens when a scammer uses your credit card information to make unauthorized purchases on Walmart Canada. To avoid falling victim to this scam, you should keep a close eye on your credit card statements and report any suspicious charges to your bank or Walmart Canada immediately.
