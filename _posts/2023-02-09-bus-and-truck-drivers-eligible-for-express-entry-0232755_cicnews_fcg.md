符合快速通道资格的公共汽车和卡车司机 此举是加拿大试图缓解全国公共汽车和运输卡车行业司机短缺问题的一部分。	Bus and truck drivers eligible for Express Entry This move comes as part of Canada’s attempt to mitigate driver shortages in the busing and transport trucking industries across the country.
	
2022 年 11 月 16 日，加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 从其国家职业分类 (NOC) 2016 系统过渡到更新的 NOC 2021 版本。	On November 16, 2022, Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) transitioned from its National Occupation Classification (NOC) 2016 system to an updated NOC 2021 version.
	
作为向 NOC 2021 过渡的一部分，IRCC 使 16 个新的职业符合快速入境条件。这些新增人员中包括运输卡车司机和公共汽车司机，这两个职业都受到加拿大严重劳动力短缺的压力。	As part of this transition to NOC 2021, IRCC made 16 occupations newly eligible for Express Entry. Included among those additions are transport truck drivers and bus drivers, two occupations that are pressured by significant labour shortages across Canada.
	
### 加拿大校车司机短缺	Canada’s school bus driver shortage
	
在公交行业，加拿大长期以来一直在处理该国多个地区校车司机短缺的问题。例如，由于工资低、“疫情期间大量退休”等因素，全国许多社区都在为学生寻找交通工具。	Within the busing industry, Canada has long dealt with a lack of school bus drivers in several parts of the country. Due to such factors as low wages and “a rash of retirements during the pandemic”, for instance, many communities across the country are struggling to find transportation for students.
	
例如，该行业的就业短缺导致取消了加拿大各地学生期待已久的活动，例如去年 10 月由一个天主教学校董事会在安大略省伦敦组织的 8000 名学生跨国会议。	As an example, employment shortages in this industry have led to the cancellation of much-anticipated events for students across Canada, such as an 8000-student cross-country meet organized by one Catholic School Board in London, Ontario last October.
	
同样在 2022 年 10 月，Global News 报道称，蒙特利尔的校车司机短缺迫使多条公交线路被取消，这与 2023 年第一周耶洛奈夫社区发生的情况类似。	Also in October 2022, Global News reported that a school bus driver shortage in Montreal forced the cancellation of several bus routes, a similar outcome as what happened to one Yellowknife community in the first week of 2023.
	
校车交通对于全国许多儿童来说至关重要，正如加拿大交通部在 2022 年 7 月发布的一份新闻稿估计，该国有 220 万儿童“每天乘车往返学校”。因此，该行业的劳动力短缺会对许多加拿大年轻人的生活产生重大影响，他们每天依靠这些方式上下学。	Transportation via school buses is vital for many children across the country, as one Transport Canada news release estimated back in July 2022 that 2.2 million children in this country “travel to and from school \[on buses\] every day.” Therefore, labour shortages in this industry can have a significant impact on the lives of many young Canadians, who rely on these methods to get to and from school daily.
	
### 加拿大的卡车司机短缺	Canada’s truck driver shortage
	
卡车驾驶行业是加拿大全国供应链发展不可或缺的一部分。根据 TruckingHR Canada 的数据，该行业的大量职位空缺——据报告在 2021 年第二季度为 18,000 个，截至 2022 年第二季度已上升至 20,110 个——“当出现中断和劳动力短缺时，会对国民经济产生重大影响。”	The truck driving industry is integral to the progression of the national supply chain across Canada. A high number of vacancies in this industry — reported at 18,000 in Q2 2021, a number that has risen to 20,110 as of Q2 2022 according to TruckingHR Canada — “has a heavy impact on the national economy when there are disruptions and labour shortages.”
	
部分原因是从“安全问题\[和\]高昂的前期培训成本”到工作与生活的平衡和退休等问题，TruckingHR Canada 估计每年将有超过 34,000 名卡车司机离开该行业。这意味着，如果全国劳动力短缺继续上升，卡车运输行业将继续阻碍加拿大经济发展，2022 年第二季度运输卡车司机的职位空缺率 (NOC 2021: 73300) 为 9.1%。	Due in part to issues ranging from “safety concerns \[and\] high upfront training costs” to work-life balance and retirements, TruckingHR Canada estimates that over 34,000 truck drivers will leave the industry annually. This means that the trucking industry, where the job vacancy rate among Transport Truck Drivers (NOC 2021: 73300) was 9.1% in Q2 of 2022, will continue to hinder the Canadian economy if nationwide labour shortages continue to rise.
	
### 快速通道的变化旨在缓解运输行业的劳动力短缺	Changes to Express Entry aimed at mitigating labour shortages in the transportation industry
	
为了缓解上述劳动力短缺问题，IRCC 已将运输卡车司机和公共汽车司机添加到有资格通过快速通道移民加拿大的职业清单中。	To mitigate the above-outlined labour shortages, IRCC has added transport truck drivers and bus drivers to the list of occupations eligible for immigration to Canada via Express Entry.
	
加拿大政上文概述 - 未来的加拿大移民。	The Government of Canada remains hopeful that this expansion to Express Entry eligibility, along with other changes to Express Entry such as targeted draws, will drive more foreign nationals — especially skilled workers who are best able to fill the country’s most pressing labour gaps, including those outlined above — toward Canadian immigration in the future.
	
注意：预计最早将于 2023 年第二季度开始的有针对性的快速通道抽签将允许 IRCC 进行快速通道抽签，该抽签不太重视候选人的综合排名系统 (CRS) 分数，而是根据特定目标寻找潜在移民语言技能、教育背景或工作经验等属性。随着加拿大越来越接近实施新程序，有关有针对性的快速通道抽签细节的更多细节将公布。	Note: Targeted Express Entry draws, which are expected to begin as early as Q2 2023, will allow IRCC to conduct Express Entry draws that place less priority on a candidate’s Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) score and instead seek out prospective immigrants based on specific target attributes such as their language skills, educational backgrounds, or work experience. Further details regarding the specifics of targeted Express Entry draws will become available as Canada gets closer to implementing the new procedure.
	
### 外国卡车和公共汽车司机的其他移民选择	Other immigration options for foreign truck and bus drivers
	
除了快速入境外，希望来加拿大的外国公民还有多种移民选择。	Beyond Express Entry, foreign nationals looking to come to Canada have several immigration options.
	
这些选项包括省提名计划 (PNP) 等途径，该计划在全国 13 个省和地区中的 11 个（不包括魁北克省和努纳武特地区）以及大西洋移民计划 (AIP) 和农村和北部移民试点（RNIP）。	These options include such pathways as Provincial Nominee Programs (PNPs), which are operated in 11 of the country’s 13 total provinces and territories (excluding Quebec and Nunavut), as well as the Atlantic Immigration Program (AIP) and the Rural and Northern Immigration Pilot (RNIP).
	
上述项目以及全国许多其他项目，允许这些项目所在的每个地区有选择地挑选当地政府认为最有助于解决当地劳动力市场缺口的外国技术工人。	The above programs, as well as many others across the country, allow each region in which these programs operate to selectively pick and choose foreign skilled workers that the local government feels would best help address local labour market gaps.
	
因此，在公共汽车和/或卡车驾驶的情况下，如果准移民申请在卡车或公共汽车行业劳动力缺口特别大的地区运营的计划，他们将自己定位为可能移民到该地区并在当地作为公共汽车或卡车司机工作。	Accordingly, in the case of bus and/or truck driving, if a prospective immigrant were to apply to a program operated in a region that had a particularly large labour gap in the trucking or busing industry, they would be positioning themselves well to possibly immigrate to that area and work locally as a bus or truck driver.
