移民到加拿大的过程是一个艰难的过程，最近由于加拿大移民欺诈率的增加而变得更具挑战性。移民诈骗的高发率已经损害了移民咨询行业的声誉。	The process of immigrating to Canada is a difficult process made even more challenging in recent times by the increased rates of Canada immigration fraud. The high incident rate of immigration scams has damaged the reputation of the immigration consultancy industry.
	
通过所有相关利益相关者（RCIC、CICC、IRCC）进行的深入调查，加拿大移民欺诈者活动的一系列共同趋势导致汇编了相关指标和警告标志，可以帮助潜在移民区分真假移民咨询公司。	Through intensive investigations conducted by all relevant stakeholders (RCIC, CICC, IRCC) a set of common trends in the activities of Canada immigration fraudsters has led to the compilation of relevant indicators and warning signs that can assist potential immigrants distinguish between real and fake immigration consultancy companies.

如何判断您的移民局是真是假（骗局）？	How To Tell If Your Immigration Agency Is Real or Fake (Scam)?
		
移民咨询公司受制于适用于所有其他企业的相同公司法和法规。这些法律法规制定的准则为所有移民咨询公司提供了一套他们必须遵守的共同职责和操作。	Immigration consultancy companies are subject to the same incorporation laws and regulations that govern all other businesses. The guidelines set by these laws and regulations gives all immigration consultancy companies a common set of duties and operations that they have to adhere to. 
	
如果任何移民咨询公司不遵守这些统一的监管特征，他们很可能会受到怀疑。	Should any immigration consultancy not adhere to these unifying regulatory characteristics, they are liable to be put under suspicion.
	
以下信息提供了所有移民代表及其附属或直接代表的咨询公司的合法性、真实性和权威性的三个特征。	The following information provides three characteristics that infers legitimacy, authenticity and authority to all immigration representatives and the consultancy companies that they are either affiliated with or directly represent.
	
* 属于移民和公民顾问学院 (CCIC) 成员的公民身份或移民顾问	  Citizenship or immigration consultants that are members of the College of Immigration and Citizenship Consultants (CCIC)
* 加拿大省或地区法律协会成员的律师或公证人	  Lawyers or notaries that are members of the Canadian provincial or territorial law society
* 上加拿大律师协会信誉良好的律师助理	  Paralegals that are members in good standing of the law society of upper Canada
	
在此处检查您的移民代表是否是移民和公民顾问学院 (CCIC) 的成员。	Check if your immigration representative is a member of the College of Immigration and Citizenship Consultants (CCIC) here.
	
如果您咨询的移民代表不具备任何这些特征，那么我们建议您立即停止咨询。假冒移民咨询公司往往试图通过使用合法公司的私人详细信息和独特的识别商标来假装他们的服务是合法的。	Should you come into consultation with an immigration representative who doesn’t possess any one of these characteristics then we recommend that you immediately stop your consultative sessions. Fake Immigration consultancy companies tend to try to pass off their services as legitimate through using the private details and unique identifying trademarks of legitimate companies. 
	
然而，假冒移民顾问的运作方式有一些共同特征，这些特征可以被确定为合法和欺诈活动的可能证据。	However, there are some common traits in how fake immigration consultancies operate that can be identified as possible evidence of illegitimate and fraudulent activity.

了解假冒或真实的移民代表和移民咨询公司的区别后，了解加拿大移民欺诈的常见类型就变得很重要。以下是加拿大潜在移民应注意的最常见的移民骗局清单：	With an understanding of what distinguishes fake or real immigration representatives and immigration consultancy companies, it becomes important to know what the common types of Canada immigration fraud are. Here’s a list of the most common immigration scams that potential immigrants to Canada should look out for:
	
### 就业诈骗	Employment Scams
	
如果移民顾问或代表为您提供一份在加拿大的工作以换取金钱，您应该立即提出怀疑。合法的移民顾问和代表绝不会谈论工作机会。作为您、申请人和 IRCC 之间的授权代理人/联络人，为您提供便利的移民程序的唯一提议。	If the immigration consultancy or representative offers you a job in Canada in exchange for money, your suspicions should be immediately raised. Legitimate immigration consultants and representatives will never speak of job offers. The only offer to facilitate the immigration process for you as authorized agents/liaisons between you, the applicant, and the IRCC.
	
### 签证诈骗	Visa Scams
	
如果移民代表或咨询公司为您提供工作签证以换取金钱，我们建议您保持警惕。移民机构和顾问无权授予您工作签证。这项权力完全属于 IRCC，并且基于通过检查您是否有资格移民加拿大的评估过程获得的成绩。	Should you be offered a work visa by an immigration representative or consultancy company in exchange for money, we advise that you be wary. Immigration agencies and consultants don’t have the power to grant you work visas .This power is solely vested in the IRCC and is based on merit earned via the evaluation process that checks your eligibility to immigrate to Canada.
	
### 移民顾问诈骗	Immigration Consultant Scams
	
移民顾问诈骗是最难识别的诈骗类型，因为它们与提供服务（促进客户移民到另一个国家）以换取金钱的移民咨询行业最常见。	Immigration consultant scams are the most difficult type of scam to identify since they are mostly in common with the immigration consultancy trade of offering a service (facilitate immigration of clients to another country) in exchange for money. 
	
然而，假移民机构和代表会伪装成合法移民机构或代表的形象，同时要求他们为这些服务预先付款。	However, fake immigration agencies and representatives will cloak themselves behind the image of a legitimate immigration agency or representative while dictating that they pay money upfront for those services.
