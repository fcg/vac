住房负担能力是许多加拿大新移民心目中的一个问题。 “在加拿大买房还是租房？”很大程度上取决于你的财务状况。	Housing affordability is a question on the minds of many newcomers to Canada. "Should I buy, or should I rent a home in Canada?" is largely dictated by your financial situation.
	
Point2Homes 分析了住房成本如何影响居住在加拿大 50 个最大城市的业主和租户。	Point2Homes analyzed how housing costs affect the owners and renters living in Canada’s 50 largest cities.
	
他们发现，加拿大房主每月在住房费用上的支出比租房者多 24%（近 300 加元）。然而，与支付近 67% 的租房者相比，超过 85% 的房主每月将收入的 30% 用于住房费用。	What they found was that Canadian homeowners spend 24 percent—almost $300 CAD—more than renters on monthly shelter costs. However, more than 85 percent of home owners spend less than 30 percent of their income on monthly shelter costs compared to renters who shell out almost 67 percent.
	
最后一点说明了房地产市场使得租房者越来越难以成为房主。	That last point speaks to a housing market that makes it increasingly more difficult for renters to become home owners.
	
房主人数（9,955,975）几乎是租房者人数（4,953,840）的两倍，占加拿大居民的 66% 以上。然而，2021 年人口普查显示加拿大的房屋自有率正在下降，许多加拿大人推迟获得抵押贷款。	The number of home owners (9,955,975) is almost double that of renters (4,953,840), making up more than 66 percent of Canadian residents. However, the 2021 Census shows Canada’s homeownership rate on the decline, with many Canadians holding off getting a mortgage.
	
在过去的十年里，租房家庭的增长速度是原来的三倍，这证明拥有住房越来越遥不可及。平均而言，租房者的支出比房主少 289 加元，这是导致更多加拿大人租房的一个因素。	This past decade, renter households grew three times faster, which is evidence that homeownership is becoming increasingly out of reach. On average, renters spend $289 CAD less than homeowners, a contributing factor in why more Canadians are renting.
	
### 安大略省和不列颠哥伦比亚省拥有最昂贵的城市，魁北克最便宜	Ontario and B.C. have the most expensive cities, Quebec the cheapest
	
每月住房费用的差异在很大程度上取决于城市。在不列颠哥伦比亚省基洛纳，房主每月平均多支付 5.08%，即 78 加元，而在安大略省布兰普顿，他们多支付 41.52%，即约 676 加元。	The difference in monthly shelter costs depends largely on the city. In Kelowna, B.C., homeowners paid an average of 5.08 percent more—$78 CAD— per month, whereas in Brampton, Ontario, they paid 41.52 percent or about $676 CAD more.

与租房者相比，不列颠哥伦比亚省萨里的房主每月要多支付 584 加元。素里和布兰普顿的住房成本都经历了自 2016 年上一次人口普查以来最大幅度的五年涨幅——分别为 25.5% 和 23%。	Homeowners in Surrey, B.C., deal with an extra $584 CAD per month compared to renters. Both Surrey and Brampton experienced the sharpest five-year uptick in housing costs since the previous Census of 2016 — 25.5 percent and 23 percent, respectively.
	
就百分比而言，蒙特利尔房主支付的住房费用比租房者多支付 58%（或 563 加元）。大多数蒙特利尔居民 (64%) 是租房者，而 36% 的人是业主。	In terms of percentage, Montreal homeowners are paying 58% more (or $563 CAD) than what renters spend on shelter costs. The majority of Montreal residents (64 percent) are renters, as opposed to 36% who are owners.
	
下表显示了加拿大城市的房主与租房者每月成本差异最大的城市。	The following table shows the Canadian cities where homeowners have the highest difference of monthly costs compared to renters.
	
魁北克城市在负担能力方面胜出。公元前和安大略省是最昂贵的省份，因为它们的房租价格高，而且有 30% 或更多的家庭将收入的 30% 或更多用于住房成本。	Quebec cities are winning in terms of affordability. B.C. and Ontario are the most expensive provinces given their high rent prices and share of households spending 30 percent or more of income on housing costs.
	
在 Point2 分析的城市中，Trois-Rivières 是唯一一个租房者和业主都应对每月低于 1,000 加元的住房成本的城市。	Among the cities Point2 analyzed, Trois-Rivières has the distinction of being the only one where both renters and owners deal with housing costs lower than $1,000 CAD per month.
	
!加拿大住房成本最低的城市	!Canadian Cities with Lowest Shelter Costs
	
所分析的所有魁北克城市的租房者住房成本均低于 1,209 加元的全国平均水平。除蒙特利尔外，魁北克城市的房主住房成本也往往较低。 Lévis 多达 89% 的家庭以及 Saguenay 88% 的家庭将不到收入的 30% 用于住房。	All of the Quebec cities analyzed have lower shelter costs for renters than the $1,209 CAD national average. Other than Montreal, Quebec cities also tend to have lower shelter costs for homeowners too.  As much as 89 percent of all households in Lévis, as well as 88 percent in Saguenay spend less than 30 percent of their income on housing.
	
另一方面，安大略省和不列颠哥伦比亚省的一些城市拥有全国最昂贵的房价。住房成本最高的前15名都集中在这两个省份。	On the other hand, Ontario and British Columbia cities have some of the most expensive housing prices in the country. The top 15 highest shelter costs are all concentrated in the two provinces.
	
!最昂贵的住房成本	!Most Expensive Housing Costs
	
安大略省奥克维尔的住房费用在加拿大最高——房主（2,384 加元）和租房者（2,146 加元）——其次是列治文山、米尔顿和旺市。虽然多伦多的租金平均每月 1,562 加元，拥有的房屋达到 2,038 加元，但万锦市、布兰普顿和阿贾克斯等城市的居民支付的住房费用甚至更高。不过，高昂的每月费用似乎并没有阻止这些城市的房主。在所有这些城市中，自住者占大多数，从奥克维尔的 78% 到旺市的 86% 不等。	Oakville, Ontario has the most expensive shelter costs in Canada — both for homeowners ($2,384 CAD) and for renters ($2,146 CAD) — followed by Richmond Hill, Milton, and Vaughan. While renting in Toronto averages $1,562 CAD per month and owning reaches $2,038 CAD, residents in cities such as Markham, Brampton, and Ajax pay even more for shelter costs. The high monthly costs don’t seem to deter home owners in these cities though. Home owners make up the majority in all of these cities, ranging from 78 percent in Oakville to 86 percent in Vaughan.
	
即便如此，安大略省的一些城市，如温莎、圣凯瑟琳斯或大萨德伯里，租户和业主的住房成本都更为合理。	Even so, there are Ontario cities, such as Windsor, St. Catharines or Greater Sudbury, where both renters and owners have more reasonable shelter costs.
	
无论您在不列颠哥伦比亚省的城市租房还是自住，您每月的住房支出都超过业主和租房者的全国平均水平。公元前业主住房成本在基洛纳的 1,614 加元到温哥华的 2,084 加元之间，而租房成本从阿伯茨福德的 1,324 加元到里士满的 1,672 加元。	Whether you rent or own in British Columbia cities, your monthly housing expenses exceed the national averages for both owners and renters. B.C. owner housing costs range between $1,614 CAD in Kelowna to $2,084 CAD in Vancouver, while renter costs go from $1,324 CAD in Abbotsford to $1,672 CAD in Richmond.
	
如果您是租房者并且想要购买，您可能需要每月多花费近 71% 或 857 加元才能成为房主。话虽如此，在温尼伯或魁北克市等城市实现飞跃更便宜。	If you are a renter and you want to buy, you may need to spend almost 71 percent or $857 CAD more per month to become a home owner. That being said, it is cheaper to take the leap in cities like Winnipeg or Quebec City.
	
在查看加拿大 10 个最大的城市时，房主最终可能比温尼伯的租房者多支付 628 加元，在魁北克市多支付 671 加元，而在多伦多多支付 1,234 加元。	When looking at Canada’s 10 largest cities, homeowners could end up paying $628 CAD more than renters in Winnipeg and $671 CAD in Quebec City, compared to $1,234 CAD more in Toronto.
