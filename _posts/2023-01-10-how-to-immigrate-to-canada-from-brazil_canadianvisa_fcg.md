u200d从巴西移民到加拿大是一个复杂的过程，需要了解和了解加拿大移民系统、其要求、项目、签证和加拿大永久居留申请流程。我们还将讨论您到达加拿大并适应加拿大生活后的期望。	‍Immigrating to Canada from Brazil is a complex process that requires knowledge and understanding of the Canadian immigration system, its requirements, programs, visas and application process for permanent residence in Canada. We'll also discuss what to expect after you arrive and adjust to life in Canada.
	
加拿大移民系统复杂且不断发展。在您开始移民程序之前，您必须了解您必须满足的要求才有资格移民加拿大。	The Canadian immigration system is complex and ever-evolving. Before you can begin the immigration process, you must understand the requirements that you must meet to be eligible to immigrate to Canada.
	
### 快速通道	Express Entry
	
从巴西移民到加拿大的最简单和最受欢迎的方式之一是通过加拿大的快速通道系统。快速入境系统于 2015 年开发，旨在帮助外国技术工人及其家人在短短六个月内获得加拿大永久居留权。该系统只对技术工人开放，分为三个项目：	One of the easiest and most popular ways to immigrate to Canada from Brazil is through Canada's Express Entry system. The Express Entry System was developed in 2015 to help skilled foreign workers and their families get permanent residency in Canada in as little as six months. This system is only open to skilled workers and is split into three programs:
	
#### 联邦技术工人计划 (FSWP)	The Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP)
	
FSWP 专为在通常需要学位的职业中具有至少一年工作经验的个人而设计。在此处了解有关此计划、其资格标准以及如何申请的更多信息。	The FSWP is specifically designed for individuals with at least one year's work experience in an occupation that generally requires a degree. Learn more about this program, its eligibility criteria and how to apply here.
	
#### 联邦技术贸易计划 (FSTP)	The Federal Skilled Trades Program (FSTP)
	
该计划专为在特定行业具有丰富工作经验的人士而设计。在此处详细了解要求以及如何申请 FSTP。	This program is specifically designed for those with significant working experience in a certain trade. Learn more about the requirements and how to apply to the FSTP here.
	
#### 加拿大经验类 (CEC)	The Canadian Experience Class (CEC)
	
该计划专为那些已经在加拿大生活和工作一年并持有加拿大工作许可或加拿大学生签证等签证的人设计。您可以在此处详细了解通过 CEC 获得永久居留权需要做什么。	This program is specifically designed for those who have already been living and working in Canada for a year on a visa like a Canadian work permit or Canadian student visa. You can learn more about what you need to do to gain permanent residency via the CEC here.
	
申请人通过加拿大政府网站上的快速通道门户申请快速通道系统。申请人必须创建一个 Express Entry 档案。在此配置文件中，它们包括基本细节，例如	Applicants apply for the Express Entry system via the Express Entry portal on the Canadian government website. Applicants must create an Express Entry profile. In this profile, they include essential details like
	
*   年龄	  Age
*   婚姻状况	  Marital Status
*   工作经验	  Work Experience
*   教育程度	  Level of Education
* 链接到加拿大	  Links to Canada
	
这些因素由综合排名系统 (CRS) 进行评估以产生 CRS 分数。每个申请人的 CRS 分数都会进入快速通道池。每两周，加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 都会进行一次快速入境抽签。	These factors are evaluated by the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS)to produce a CRS score. Every applicant's CRS score is entered into the Express Entry pool. Every two weeks, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) runs an Express Entry Draw.
	
在每次抽签中，CRS 分数高于特定数字的申请人都会收到申请加拿大永久居留权 (ITA) 的邀请。根据申请人池的大小和实力，每次抽签的具体数字都会发生变化。	In each draw, applicants with a CRS score higher than a certain number are presented with an Invitation to Apply (ITA) for Canadian permanent residency. The particular number changes with every draw based on the size and strength of the applicant pool.
	
一旦申请人收到他们的 ITA，他们有 60 天的时间用支持文件证实他们的快速通道个人资料信息。之后，只要所有文件都是正确的、有效的和最新的，他们就可以在短短三个月内获得加拿大永久居留权。	Once applicants receive their ITA, they have 60 days to corroborate their Express Entry profile information with supporting documents. After that, provided all the documentation is correct, valid, and up to date, they can receive their Canadian permanent residency in as little as three months.
	
虽然这听起来像是一个简单的过程，但有几个主要因素会极大地影响您在此计划中的成功以及该计划需要多长时间。假设您希望确保您的流程顺利高效地进行。在这种情况下，您可以做的最好的事情之一就是利用移民专家的帮助，例如受监管的加拿大移民顾问 (RCIC)。	While this may sound like a simple process, several primary factors can greatly impact your success in this program and how long this program can take. Suppose you want to ensure your process goes smoothly and efficiently. In that case, one of the best things you can do is utilize the help of an immigration expert like a Regulated Canadian Immigration Consultant (RCIC).
	
RCIC 可以对您进行全面评估，以确保您选择了完美的项目，创建您的 Express Entry 资料，帮助您组织和验证您的支持文件，并在申请过程的每一步为您提供所需的帮助和指导。	An RCIC can fully evaluate you to ensure you've chosen the perfect program, create your Express Entry profile, help you organize and validate your supporting documentation, and provide you with the help and guidance you need through every step of your application process.

### 省提名项目	Provincial Nominee Programs
	
加拿大是一个幅员辽阔的国家。它是世界上土地面积第二大的国家。因此，加拿大不同地区的劳动力行业和潜在新移民的需求大相径庭。为了帮助缓解加拿大不同省份的需求，加拿大 13 个省中有 11 个有省提名计划 (PNP)。	Canada is a massive country. It's the second largest country in the world regarding land mass. As a result, different parts of Canada have vastly different needs from its workforce industries and potential newcomers. To help alleviate the needs of the different provinces of Canada, 11 out of Canada's 13 provinces have Provincial Nominee Programs (PNPs).
	
这些计划由每个参与省份的省级当局专门设计，以提名能够填补省级劳动力缺口的外国技术工人，获得加拿大永久居留权，前提是他们计划在该省生活和工作。	These programs are devised by the provincial authorities of each participating province specifically to nominate skilled foreign workers who can fulfil gaps in the provincial workforce for permanent residency in Canada, provided they plan to live and work in that province.
	
要获得 PNP，申请人必须通过在“快速通道”档案中注明或直接向该省申请来表明他们有兴趣搬到特定省份。成功的申请者将获得加拿大永久居留权。	To get a PNP, applicants must indicate their interest in moving to a specific province by either indicating on their Express Entry profile or applying directly to the province. Successful applicants will receive permanent residency in Canada.
	
每个省的 PNP 都有几个更小、更具体的项目，以满足每个省的主要需求。这是省提名计划的完整细目，它们在每个省的运作方式以及可供申请人使用的众多较小的类别。	Each province's PNP has several smaller, more specific programs tailored to each province's major needs. Here's a full breakdown of the Provincial Nominee Programs, how they work in each province and the numerous smaller streams available to applicants.
	
#### 家庭赞助	Family Sponsorship
	
如果您已经有近亲居住在加拿大，成为加拿大永久居民的最佳方式之一就是通过家庭赞助计划申请。加拿大政府有兴趣让抵达加拿大的国际家庭团聚。	If you already have close family living in Canada, one of the best ways to become a permanent resident of Canada is to apply via a family sponsorship program. The Canadian government is interested in keeping international families together when they arrive in Canada.
	
因此，他们创建了多个家庭赞助计划，以帮助国际移民与他们在加拿大的家人团聚。每个人与家人的关系分为三大流派。在此处详细了解不同的家庭赞助方式以及如何申请。	As a result, they have created several family sponsorship programs to help international immigrants reunite with their families in Canada.
