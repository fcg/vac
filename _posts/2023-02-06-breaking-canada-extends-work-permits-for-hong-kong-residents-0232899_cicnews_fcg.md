突发事件：加拿大延长香港居民的工作许可 加拿大将香港人的开放式工作许可再延长两年。	BREAKING: Canada extends work permits for Hong Kong residents Canada is extending the Open Work Permit for Hong Kongers by an additional two years.
	
移民部长肖恩·弗雷泽 (Sean Fraser) 刚刚宣布，加拿大正在扩大对香港国民的开放式工作许可选择。	Immigration minister Sean Fraser has just announced Canada is expanding its open work permit options for Hong Kong nationals.
	
这位部长今天早上在多伦多发表讲话说，原定于今天到期的香港居民现有开放式工作许可证 (OWP) 将再延长两年。	Speaking from Toronto this morning, the minister said the existing Open Work Permit (OWP) for Hong Kong residents, which was set to expire today, will be extended an additional two years.
	
要符合资格，香港居民必须在过去 10 年内获得加拿大专上文凭或学位，这改变了目前的五年要求，或持有同等的外国证书，他们可以获得教育证书评估.大专文凭课程必须至少为两年。	To be eligible, Hong Kong residents must have graduated with a Canadian post-secondary diploma or degree in the last 10 years, a change from the current requirement of five years, or hold an equivalent foreign credential for which they can get an Educational Credential Assessment. A post-secondary diploma program must be a minimum of two years.
	
目前暂时在加拿大的香港居民，包括访客、学生和工人，可以在加拿大境内在线申请。从国外申请的人仍然受到当前的旅行限制，目前可能无法来加拿大，除非他们有工作机会或满足旅行豁免并遵守所有公共卫生要求。香港居民前往加拿大目前需要出示 COVID-19 检测呈阴性的证明。	Hong Kong residents currently in Canada temporarily, including visitors, students and workers, can apply online from within Canada. Those applying from abroad remain subject to current travel restrictions and may not be able to come to Canada at this time, unless they have a job offer or meet a travel exemption and comply with all public health requirements. Hong Kong residents who travel to Canada currently need to show proof of a negative COVID-19 test.
	
### 加拿大为香港人提供的永久居留途径	Canada’s permanent residence pathways for Hong Kongers
	
加拿大也为在加拿大完成部分或全部专上教育的香港居民提供永久居留途径。有两个流：	Canada also has permanent residence pathways dedicated to Hong Kong residents who have completed some, or all, of their post-secondary education in Canada. There are two streams:
	
**A类**为过去三年从加拿大专上院校毕业的香港居民提供永久居留权。	**Stream A** offers permanent residence to Hong Kong residents that have graduated from a Canadian post-secondary institution in the last three years.
	
**B类**为毕业于加拿大或国外专上院校并在加拿大至少有一年工作经验的香港居民提供永久居留权。	**Stream B** offers permanent residence to Hong Kong residents that have graduated from a post-secondary institution in Canada or abroad and have at least one year of work experience in Canada.
	
在这两个类别中，主申请人（学生）还可以包括配偶、伴侣和受抚养子女。	Under these two streams, principal applicants (the student) may also include a spouse, partner and dependent children.
	
主申请人必须持有由以下之一签发的护照：	The principal applicant must have a passport issued by one of:
	
* 中华人民共和国香港特别行政区；	  the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China;
* 英国指在香港出生、入籍或注册的英国海外国民。	  the United Kingdom to a British National Overseas, as a person born, naturalized or registered in Hong Kong.
	
### **在加拿大的香港人**	**Hong Kongers in Canada**
	
香港一直是加拿大最大的移民来源地之一。根据2021年人口普查数据，加拿大有213,855名移民选择香港作为他们的出生地，位居加拿大前五名亚洲移民来源国之列。	Hong Kong has always been among Canada’s largest sources of immigrants. According to 2021 census data, there were 213,855 immigrants in Canada who selected Hong Kong as their place of birth, putting it among the top five Asian source countries for immigrants in Canada.
	
直到 1997 年，香港一直是加拿大的第一大移民来源地，每年有多达 30,000 名香港居民移居加拿大。作为前英国殖民地，加拿大与香港有一些共同的历史，这有助于建立牢固的经济关系。 1997 年，香港不再是英国殖民地，交还给中国政府，人数大幅下降。	Until 1997 Hong Kong was the number one source of immigration to Canada, with up to 30,000 Hong Kong residents moving to Canada each year. Canada has some shared history with Hong Kong as former British colonies, which helped create a strong economic relationship.  In 1997 Hong Kong ceased to be a British colony and was handed back to the Chinese government and numbers dropped significantly.
	
数据显示，在 2022 年 1 月至 2022 年 11 月期间，加拿大迎来了 3,750 名来自香港的新永久居民。这是在 2021 年的 2,295 人的基础上增加的。此外，即使在 COVID-19 大流行的高峰期，加拿大在 2020 年仍然迎来了 1,045 名来自香港的永久居民。	Data shows Canada welcomed 3,750 new permanent residents from Hong Kong between January and November 2022. This builds on the 2,295 in 2021. Further, even during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Canada still welcomed 1,045 permanent residents from Hong Kong in 2020.
	
尽管如此，从 2015 年开始，每年发放的学习许可数量一直在稳步增加，当时发放了 2,095 个学习许可。这一数字在 2021 年和 2022 年上升至 6,345，在 1 月至 11 月期间向香港人签发了 8,705 个学习许可。	Still, there has been a steady increase in study permits issued each year starting from 2015 when 2,095 study permits were issued. This number rose to 6,345 in 2021 and in 2022, 8,705 study permits were issued to Hong Kongers between January and November.
	
根据国际流动计划签发的工作许可证数量也有所增加。从 2019 年到 2022 年，颁发的许可证数量从 985 个增加到 2022 年的 8,795 个。2022 年的数据是 2021 年颁发的 4,005 个许可证的两倍多。	There has also been a rise in the number of work permits issued under the International Mobility Program. Between 2019 and 2022, the number of permits issued rose from 985 to 8,795 in 2022. The 2022 data more than doubles the 4,005 permits issued in 2021.
