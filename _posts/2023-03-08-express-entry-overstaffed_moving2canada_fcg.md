## 议会预算的监督机构报告称，加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 的快速入境工作人员太多。	Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) has too many staff working on Express Entry, the parliamentary budget's watchdog reports.
	
加拿大议会预算官 Yves Giroux 于 3 月 7 日发布了他对三个“快速通道”移民计划的分析。	Yves Giroux, Canada’s parliamentary budget officer, released his analysis of the three Express Entry immigration programs on March 7.
	
该报告估算了运行联邦技术工人计划、加拿大经验类计划和联邦技术贸易计划的成本。这些计划涵盖除魁北克省以外的所有加拿大移民。 IRCC 的任务是在收到申请后的六个月内处理其中 80% 的申请。	The report estimates the costs of running the Federal Skilled Workers Program, the Canadian Experience Class and the Federal Skilled Trades Program. These programs cover immigration to all of Canada except for the province of Quebec. IRCC’s mandate is to process 80 percent of these applications within six months of receipt.
	
Giroux 预计，未来五年，快速通道系统的总成本（包括处理、抵达前服务和结算服务）将达到 7.92 亿美元。这笔费用将被从申请人那里收取的 7.43 亿美元的费用收入所抵消，从而导致净总成本为 4800 万美元。	Giroux projects that the gross cost of the Express Entry system (including processing, pre-arrival services and settlement services) will be $792 million over the next five years. This cost will be offset by $743 million in fee revenue collected from applicants, resulting in a net total cost of $48 million.
	
“根据我们的分析，加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 目前的人员配备水平预计足以满足未来五年的处理时间目标，”Giroux 在媒体发布会上说。 “事实上，我们估计 IRCC 的员工人数比实现本财年目标所需的人数多 65%。”	“Based on our analysis, current staffing levels at Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) are expected to be more than sufficient to meet the processing time goal for the next five years,” Giroux says in a media release. “In fact, we estimate that IRCC has 65% more staff than needed to meet their goal this fiscal year.”
	
然而，该报告补充说，随着申请数量的增加，这一百分比将逐年下降，最终在 2026-27 年达到 4%。	However, the report adds that this percentage will decline each year as the number of applications increases, ultimately reaching 4 percent in 2026-27.
	
根据该报告，在 2022-23 年，每名被录取的永久居民的费用估计为 91 加元。由于通货膨胀和其他因素，此成本会随着时间的推移而变化。	According to the report, in 2022-23, the cost per admitted permanent resident is estimated to be $91 CAD. This cost will vary over time due to inflation and other factors.
	
IRCC 没有向 Giroux 提供过去几年实现处理时间目标所需资源的信息，因为该信息代表内阁的机密信息——需要与司法部协商才能发布。	IRCC did not provide Giroux with information about the resources that would have been required to meet processing time goals in past years, because this information represents cabinet confidences—which would require consultations with the Department of Justice to be released.
	
IRCC 确实表示，它可以上下调整快速通道申请人的接收量，以确保其员工能够满足服务标准和水平。	IRCC did say that it can adjust the intake of Express Entry applicants up or down to ensure its staff is able to meet service standards and levels.

### 预算官员预测 2027 年将有 123,000 多名快速入境移民	Budget officer predicts 123,000+ Express Entry immigrants in 2027
	
为了完成分析，Giroux 预测了在 IRCC 当前计划之外的几年内将有多少快速入境移民来到加拿大。	To complete the analysis, Giroux projected how many Express Entry immigrants would come to Canada in the years beyond what IRCC has currently planned for.
	
每年，IRCC 都会发布其移民水平计划，概述其未来三个日历年的移民目标。目前，官方移民水平计划涵盖 2023-2025 年。在分析中，Giroux 假设 2025 年之后，年增长率将等于 2015 年至 2025 年的平均年增长率（7%）。	Every year, IRCC publishes its Immigration Levels Plan to outline its immigration targets for the next three calendar years. Currently, the official immigration levels plan covers the years 2023-2025. In the analysis, Giroux assumes that after 2025, the annual growth rate will be equal to the average annual growth rate between 2015 and 2025 (7 percent).
	
IRCC 在三个快速通道管理的项目中经常超过其移民目标。然而，对于 2023-25 年，Giroux 假设计划的移民水平将达到而不是超过，因为目标相对高于往年。	IRCC often surpasses its immigration targets in the three Express Entry-managed programs. However, for 2023-25, Giroux assumes the planned immigration levels will be met rather than surpassed, as the targets are comparably higher than in previous years.
	
Giroux 预测未来五个财政年度将接纳以下数量的快速通道移民：	Giroux predicts the following numbers of Express Entry immigrants will be admitted over the next five fiscal years:
	
- 2022-2023 年：75,259	-   2022-2023: 75,259
- 2023-2024：89,415	-   2023-2024: 89,415
- 2024-2025：110,265	-   2024-2025: 110,265
- 2025-2026：115,885	-   2025-2026: 115,885
- 2026-2027：123,552	-   2026-2027: 123,552
	
然而，只有 IRCC 可以设定官方目标。水平计划每年都在变化。预计 2025 年还将举行联邦选举。下一次移民水平计划将在 2023 年 11 月 1 日或之前提交。	Only IRCC can set official targets, however. Levels plans change annually. A federal election is also expected in 2025. The next Immigration Levels Plan will be tabled on or before November 1, 2023.
