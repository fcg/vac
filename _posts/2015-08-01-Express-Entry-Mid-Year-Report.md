## Express Entry Mid-Year Report

Express Entry is a dynamic application management system that changes each day as people enter and exit the pool. This report is a snapshot of the Express Entry system for the initial six months of implementation. It is based on a data extract as of July 6, 2015 and it represents only one moment in time. It includes information on the number of invitations issued since the launch of Express Entry in early January 2015, as well as information on candidates in the Express Entry pool.

It is important to note that:

1.  The following tables are based on self reported information. CIC only verifies information once a formal application for permanent residence is received.
2.  Express Entry is still in the early days of operation and as such represents initial observations only.

## Background

Launched in January 2015, Express Entry is a new application management system for certain economic immigration programs including the Federal Skilled Worker Program, Federal Skilled Trades Program, Canadian Experience Class and a portion of the Provincial Nominee program.

The management of applications via the Express Entry system results in faster processing; prevents the build-up of application backlogs; and, improves the economic outcomes of immigrants by ensuring that skilled newcomers with the best indicators for success in Canada’s labour market are invited to apply rather than those who happen to be first in line. Only the highest ranking candidates are invited to complete an application for permanent residence.

Express Entry also increases the labour market responsiveness of the immigration system through a greater role for employers who have a more direct role in recruiting economic immigrants using the new system. When an employer is unable to find a qualified Canadian or permanent resident for a job, they can now be matched with qualified Express Entry candidates through the Government of Canada’s Job Bank. All jobs offered to Express Entry candidates need to be supported by a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA).

## Invitation Rounds

Implementing the Express Entry system was a significant undertaking and we continue to monitor it closely. During this initial start-up period, it is expected that the majority of admissions in 2015 are likely to come from applications submitted before January 1, 2015, i.e. not through Express Entry.

CIC has planned for small and regular invitation rounds in the first few months to allow for adjustments to the system, ensuring program integrity and its success.

As anticipated, small and frequent rounds have shaped the results to-date. For example, a large number of foreign nationals already working in Canada have received invitations to apply because they have job offers supported by an LMIA which awarded them 600 additional points under the Express Entry system. These early rounds have also likely included foreign nationals who were unable to apply before Express Entry because of occupation caps or because application space for programs was surpassed.

Future rounds from the Express Entry pool will become the main source of applications to meet annual immigration levels targets for certain economic immigration programs under the Express Entry system as the older inventories are reduced.

## Express Entry Pool

Our ability to meet immigration levels in the three federal economic immigration programs managed by the Express Entry system requires sufficient candidates in the pool with the skills and experience that the Canadian labour market needs.

At present, the pool is growing by about 1,500 persons per week. Over the coming months, the size of the pool is expected to remain large offering a broad range of candidates from around the world who are ready to contribute to Canada and the Canadian labour market.

## Express Entry Profiles submitted to the Express Entry Pool

Those who meet the criteria of one of the federal immigration programs managed by the Express Entry system (i.e. Federal Skilled Worker, Canadian Experience Class and Federal Skilled Trades Program) are accepted into a pool of candidates<sup id="fn1-rf">[<span class="wb-inv">Footnote</span> 1](#fn1)</sup>.  Provincial Nominees participating in Express Entry must also meet the criteria of one of the three federal immigration programs.

As of July 6, 2015, a total of 112,701 foreign nationals had submitted an Express Entry profile. Of these, 48,723 were found not eligible because they did not meet the criteria of at least one of the three programs managed by the system; 4,302 were pending due to Job Bank registration or verification of their Provincial Nomination by a Province or Territory; 6,441 withdrew their profile; 41,218 were eligible to be invited to apply; and 12,017 were invited to apply for permanent resident status.

</table>

The number of candidates invited is lower than the number of invitations sent because some candidates have received more than one invitation. Express Entry candidates may decline an invitation, return to the Express Entry pool and may be eligible to receive another invitation.

## Express Entry Pool

Express Entry automatically assigns a Comprehensive Ranking System score to candidates who submit a profile. The Comprehensive Ranking System score is based on the information they provide in their profile including their age, education, official language proficiency and work experience. All self-reported information must be supported with appropriate documentation at the application stage or a candidate will be refused.

Candidates are ranked according to their CRS scores at the time of an invitation round. CRS scores may change as a candidate’s particular circumstances change. For example, a candidate may complete another post-secondary degree, gain more work experience or be nominated by a province or territory. The Express Entry pool is dynamic and a candidate’s rank may change as other candidates join and leave the pool.

Potential candidates can receive 600 additional points for a job offer or a provincial/territorial nomination. Candidates with higher scores have a higher likelihood of being invited. As of July 6, 2015, the CRS scores of the 41,218 eligible foreign nationals in the pool were distributed as per the table below.

It shows the distribution of candidates in the Express Entry pool as of July 6\. This distribution is made up of candidates with a wide range of score based on their human capital attributes, LMIA-backed job offers and provincial nominations. More information on the Comprehensive Ranking System is available on our [website](/english/express-entry/criteria-crs.asp#crs).

## Results of Express Entry Rounds for Invitations to Apply for Permanent Residence

A growing number of invitations have been issued through Express Entry but we are still in the early stages of implementation. The following tables display distribution of those invited across economic immigration programs as well as the top ten countries of residence and countries of citizenship. Over time, this will likely change as the number of rounds and invitations grow.

Almost all candidates invited in the first four invitation rounds had job offers supported by LMIAs. The vast majority of these candidates were working in Canada, were familiar with Canada’s immigration system and were able to submit a profile quickly. With 600 points for a job offer they became top-ranked candidates. In March, candidates without job offers or provincial nominations (CRS score less than 600 points) began to be invited on a regular basis.

In the early weeks of Express Entry, Canada was the dominant country of residence for invited candidates because of the number of foreign workers with LMIA backed job offers that wish to settle in Canada permanently. The country of origin reflects the origin of qualified candidates from the pool.  Express Entry is still in early stages of implementation and it is anticipated that the top ten countries will continue to shift as more candidates are invited to apply.
