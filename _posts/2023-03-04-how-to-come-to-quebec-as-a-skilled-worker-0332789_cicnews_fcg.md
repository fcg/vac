# 如何作为技术工人来到魁北克 魁北克对希望在该省定居的外国技术工人有自己的计划和标准。	How to come to Quebec as a skilled worker Quebec has its own programs and criteria for foreign skilled workers hoping to settle in the province.
魁北克在加拿大具有独特的地位，有特定的规定和权力来保护其独特的文化和语言。尽管加拿大宪法规定移民属于联邦和省级权力机构，但魁北克省拥有比其他任何省份更多的移民权力。 1968 年，魁北克成立了自己的移民部。	Quebec has a unique status in Canada, with specific provisions and powers in place to protect its distinct culture and language. Although the Canadian Constitution states that immigration falls under both federal and provincial power, Quebec has more immigration authority than any other province. In 1968, Quebec launched its own immigration ministry.
	
今天，与加拿大其他地区不同，魁北克完全控制着它允许进入该省的永久居民、学习许可和工作许可持有人。魁北克有权根据自己的标准和程序确定自己的移民目标和选择候选人。此外，魁北克的雇主在雇用外国工人时也需要遵守某些不同的程序。	Today, Quebec, unlike the rest of Canada, has complete control over the permanent residents, study permit and work permit holders that it admits into the province. Quebec has the power to determine its own immigration targets and select candidates based on its own criteria and procedures. In addition, employers in Quebec are also subject to certain distinct procedures when hiring a foreign worker.
	
### 魁北克技术工人	Quebec Skilled Workers
	
技术工人可以通过以下计划之一移民到魁北克：	A skilled worker can immigrate to Quebec through one of the following programs:
	
- 魁北克技术工人计划 (QSWP)	-   Quebec Skilled Worker Program (QSWP)
- 魁北克经验班 (PEQ)	-   Quebec Experience Class (PEQ)
	
QSWP 适用于希望移民到魁北克的外国技术工人。他们必须通过名为 Arrima 的在线平台提交意向书 (EOI)，以表明他们有兴趣移民到该省。候选人根据年龄、教育程度、语言技能和工作经验等因素进行评分。移民、法语化和融合部将从候选人库中选出得分最高的候选人，并邀请他们申请永久选拔。	The QSWP is for foreign skilled workers who wish to immigrate to Quebec. They must declare their interest in immigrating to the province by submitting an expression of interest (EOI) through an online platform called Arrima. Candidates are scored on factors such as age, education, language skills and work experience. The Ministry of Immigration, Francization and Integration will select top scoring candidates from the pool and invite them to apply for permanent selection.
	
PEQ 是外国毕业生和在魁北克有工作经验的候选人的一个选择。该计划的目标是帮助雇主雇用已经定居并很好融入该省的外国人。	The PEQ is an option for foreign graduates and candidates with work experience in Quebec. The goal of the program is to help employers hire foreigners who have already settled and are well-integrated into the province.
	
**魁北克选择证书**	**Quebec Selection Certificate**
	
魁北克选择证书 (CSQ) 由移民、法语化和融合部管理，它确认外国人已被选中在魁北克定居。凭借 CSQ，候选人可以向加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 申请加拿大永久居留权。	The Quebec Selection Certificate (CSQ) is administered by the Ministry of Immigration, Francization and Integration, and it affirms that the foreign national has been selected to settle in Quebec. With a CSQ, the candidate can apply for Canadian permanent residence to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC).
	
根据 QSWP 和 PEQ 选择的候选人将获得 CSQ，然后可以申请永久居留权。	Candidates who are chosen under the QSWP and the PEQ are issued a CSQ and can then apply for permanent residence.
	
**临时外国工人选择**	**Temporary Foreign Worker Options**
	
外国公民可以通过两种途径来加拿大工作：临时外国工人计划 (TFWP) 和国际流动计划 (IMP)。	Foreign nationals can come to Canada to work through two pathways: the Temporary Foreign Worker Program (TFWP) and the International Mobility Program (IMP).
	
TFWP 允许加拿大雇主通过国际招聘来应对该国的劳动力短缺需求，同时还确保加拿大公民和永久居民优先获得职位空缺。	The TFWP allows Canadian employers to respond to the labour shortage needs in the country by hiring internationally, while also ensuring that Canadian citizens and permanent residents are prioritized for job openings.
	
IMP 的存在是为了促进加拿大的经济、社会和文化政策目标。它不仅有助于解决劳动力市场的需求，而且允许外国工人来到加拿大并加强与国际社会的联系，并促进加拿大的艺术、文化、体育和宗教。	The IMP exists to promote Canada’s economic, social, and cultural policy objectives. Not only does it help address labour market needs, but it allows foreign workers to come to Canada and strengthen ties with the global community and promote art, culture, sports and religion in Canada.
	
TFWP 要求完成劳动力市场影响评估 (LMIA)，而 IMP 则不需要。 LMIA 是一份证明雇用外国工人将对加拿大劳动力市场产生积极或中性影响的文件。在外籍工人可以使用 TFWP 开始在加拿大工作之前，需要获得临时工作许可证和 LMIA。	The TFWP requires the completion of the Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA), while the IMP does not. An LMIA is a document that demonstrates that the hiring of the foreign worker will have a positive or neutral impact to the Canadian labour market. A temporary work permit and a LMIA are required before a foreign worker can begin worker in Canada with a TFWP.
	
如果魁北克雇主想通过临时工作许可证雇用外国技术工人，除了 LMIA 之外，他们还必须获得魁北克验收证书 (CAQ)。	If a Quebec employer wants to hire a foreign skilled worker on a Temporary Work Permit, they must get a Quebec Acceptance Certificate (CAQ) in addition to an LMIA.
	
CAQ 证明移民、法语化和融合部根据 LMIA 评估，雇佣外国工人将对该省的劳动力市场产生积极或中性的影响。 LMIA 豁免的工作不需要 CAQ。	The CAQ certifies that the Ministry of Immigration, Francization and Integration is in accordance with the LMIA assessment that the hiring of the foreign worker will have a positive or neutral effect on the province’s labour market. Jobs that are LMIA-exempt do not require a CAQ.
	
### 如果你想雇用外籍工人	If you want to hire a foreign worker
	
魁北克移民部发布了一份符合简化 LMIA 处理条件的职业清单。这个过程被认为是便利的，因为劳动力短缺得到证实，允许魁北克雇主更快地雇用外国工人，因为他们不必证明没有合格的加拿大工人来填补这个角色。	The Quebec Immigration Ministry releases a list of occupations that are eligible for facilitated LMIA processing. The process is considered facilitated because the labor shortages are proven, allowing the Quebec employers to hire foreign workers more quickly as they do not have to demonstrate that there were no eligible Canadian workers to fill the role.
	
魁北克政府简化了雇用具有有效 CSQ 的临时外国工人的程序，使他们可以免除申请 LMIA 的要求。如果雇主雇用的外国工人符合以下条件，则他们可以避免 LMIA 的要求：	The Quebec government has simplified the hiring of temporary foreign workers who have a valid CSQ, allowing them to be exempt from the requirement to apply for a LMIA. Employers can avoid the requirement for an LMIA if they are hiring a foreign worker who:
	
- 拥有有效的工作许可证；	-   Has a valid work permit;
- 持有 CSQ；	-   Holds a CSQ;
- 目前居住在魁北克；	-   Currently resides in Quebec;
- 并已根据魁北克技术工人计划申请永久居留权。	-   And has applied for permanent residency under the Quebec Skilled Worker Program.
	
外国工人还必须满足以下要求之一：	The foreign worker must also meet one of the following requirements:
	
- 正在寻求延长其当前雇主的工作许可；	-   Is seeking to extend the work permit for their current employer;
- 正在寻求与魁北克省内的新雇主续签工作许可；	-   Is seeking to renew the work authorization with a new employer within Quebec;
- 是拥有毕业后工作许可和魁北克有效工作机会的外国学生；或者	-   Is a foreign student who has a post-graduation work permit and a validated job offer in Quebec; or
- 正在参加加拿大国际经验 (IEC) 计划中的一个计划，并希望为其当前雇主延长工作授权或为魁北克的新雇主续签。	-   Is participating in a program within the International Experience Canada (IEC) program and wants to either extend the work authorization for their current employer or renew it for a new employer in Quebec.
