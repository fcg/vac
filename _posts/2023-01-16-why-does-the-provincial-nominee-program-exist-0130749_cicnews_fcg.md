为什么存在省提名计划？探索加拿大最受欢迎的移民计划之一背后的原因。	Why does the Provincial Nominee Program exist? Exploring the reasons behind one of Canada's most popular immigration programs.
	
今年，省提名计划（PNP）迎来了超过 40,000 名加拿大新移民；甚至比通过“快速通道”管理的项目录取的申请人还要多——这是自 2015 年“快速通道”设立以来的首次。加拿大的 PNP 是一种越来越流行的获得永久居留权 (PR) 的方法，它有一段有趣的历史，对于理解它至关重要该计划如何运行、其优先级以及您如何使用这些信息来帮助您获得移民机会。	This year, the Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) has welcomed over 40,000 new immigrants to Canada; even more applicants than those accepted through the Express Entry\-managed programs—a first since Express Entry was instituted in 2015. An increasingly popular method of obtaining permanent residence (PR), Canada’s PNP has an interesting history that is crucial to know in understanding how the program runs, its priorities, and how you can use this information to aid your chances at immigration.
	
### 90 年代的移民	Immigration in the ’90s
	
PNP 的存在是为了在整个加拿大传播移民的好处，并（通过扩展）帮助各省满足其经济需求。	The PNP exists to spread the benefits of immigration throughout Canada, and (by extension) to help provinces fulfill their economic needs.
	
在 20 世纪 90 年代中期，大部分 (88%) 的加拿大移民集中在三个省份（至今仍是人口最多的省份）——安大略省、魁北克省和不列颠哥伦比亚省。结果，草原省份（阿尔伯塔省、萨斯喀彻温省和马尼托巴省）和大西洋省份（新斯科舍省、新不伦瑞克省、爱德华王子岛省、纽芬兰省和拉布拉多省）意识到，移民的比例要小得多（其余 12% 的移民）正在这八个省、育空地区和西北地区之间传播。	In the mid-1990s most (88%) of Canadian immigration was focused in three provinces (that are still the most populous to this day) — Ontario, Quebec, and British Columbia. As a result, the Prairie provinces (Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba), and the Atlantic provinces (Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland, and Labrador) realized that a significantly smaller proportion (the remaining 12% of immigrants) were being spread between these eight provinces, and the Yukon and Northwest Territories.
	
这将给这些省份的社会和经济目标带来严重问题，并为即将到来的创新奠定基础；因为省政府正在寻找一种方法，使移民到他们的省份对外国工人更具吸引力。	This would pose a serious problem to the social and economic goals of these provinces, and set the groundwork for the innovations that were to come; as the provincial governments looked for a way to make immigration to their provinces more enticing to foreign workers.
	
### 温尼伯喷气机队的失利	The loss of the Winnipeg Jets
	
1996年，曼尼托巴省的曲棍球队温尼伯喷气机队因财政问题被迫迁出该省，转会至亚利桑那州的凤凰城（成为菲尼克斯土狼队）；曼尼托巴人心痛的一个原因。	In 1996, Manitoba’s hockey team, the Winnipeg Jets were forced to move out of the province due to financial concerns, transitioning to Phoenix, Arizona (becoming the Phoenix Coyotes); a cause of heartache among Manitobans.
	
失去一支心爱的运动队是 10 名曼尼托巴商人组成的团体的动力，他们联合起来创建了曼尼托巴商业委员会 (BCM)。该小组由现任国会议员 Jim Carr 阁下领导，他曾担任自然资源部长，（后来）担任国际贸易多元化部长。	The loss of a beloved sports team was the impetus for a group of 10 Manitoba businessmen, who banded together to create the Business Council of Manitoba (BCM). The group was led by the Honorable Jim Carr, a current member of parliament, who in the past served as the Minister of Natural Resources, and (later) as The Minister of International Trade Diversification.
	
BCM 之所以团结一致，不仅是因为温尼伯喷气机队的失利，还因为一个共同的信念，即随着人口的增加，曼尼托巴省将更有能力发展其经济并留住原本会移民到其他省份的年轻人。他们认为这是导致该省经济萎缩的根本问题，也是导致喷气式飞机离开的根本原因。	The BCM was united not just by the loss of the Winnipeg Jets, but also by a shared belief that with more people, Manitoba would be much better positioned to grow its economy and retain youth who would otherwise immigrate to other provinces. They believed this was the underlying issue that was causing economic contraction within the province, and that had led to the Jets’ departure.
	
### 建立 PNP	Instituting the PNP
	
马尼托巴省将被证明是制定和实施 PNP 的先行者；从曼尼托巴省提名计划 (MPNP) 开始。	Manitoba would prove to be a forerunner in developing and implementing the PNP; starting with the Manitoba Provincial Nominee Program (MPNP).
	
在 BCM 的帮助下，省政府将在 1996 年签署《加拿大-马尼托巴移民法》，这是此类双边框架中的第一个。为实施可以帮助曼尼托巴省的新移民政策奠定了基础，此后发展迅速：	With the help of the BCM, the provincial government would sign the Canada-Manitoba Immigration Act in 1996, the first bilateral framework of its kind. Setting the stage to implement a new immigration policy that could aid Manitoba, developments happened quickly thereafter:
	
* 1997 年曼尼托巴启动了一项鼓励移民到该省农村地区的试点计划；	  1997 saw Manitoba launch a pilot program to encourage immigration to rural areas of the province;
* 1998 年曼尼托巴签署了曼尼托巴省提名计划附件，实施了加拿大历史上第一个 PNP；	  In 1998 Manitoba signs the Manitoba Provincial Nominee Program Annex, implementing the first-ever PNP in Canada’s history;
* 1999 年第一批 418 名被提名人抵达马尼托巴省；	  In 1999 the first 418 nominees arrive in Manitoba;
* 2004 年至 2006 年间，MPNP 扩展到六个新的技术工人流，增加了灵活性并将可用性扩大到 10,000 名申请人；	  Between 2004 – 2006 the MPNP expands to six new skilled worker streams, increasing flexibility and expanding availability to 10,000 applicants;
* 2008 年马尼托巴签署了《工人招聘和保护法》，这是加拿大第一个保护外国工人的此类立法；	  In 2008 Manitoba signed the Worker Recruitment & Protection Act, the first legislation of its kind in Canada to protect foreign workers;
* 2010年“Manitoba Start”，为临时工和居民提供安置服务；和	  In 2010 “Manitoba Start”, a settlement service for temporary workers and residents opens; and
* 2011 年，温尼伯喷气机队返回家乡。	  In 2011 the Winnipeg Jets return to their home province.
	
随后几年，其他省份会从马尼托巴省的成功中得到启发，并选择自己的 PNP；今天，每个省（魁北克省和努纳武特地区除外）都有自己的计划，PNP 总数增加到 80 多个。	The subsequent years would see other provinces take cues from Manitoba’s success, and pick up their own PNPs; today each province (with the exception of Quebec and the territory of Nunavut) has its own program, with the total number of PNPs growing to over 80.
	
### 更广泛的采用	Wider adoption
	
在马尼托巴省的 PNP 取得巨大成功后，其他省份希望实施类似的计划来满足自己的经济需求。	After the resounding success of Manitoba’s PNP, other provinces looked to implement similar programs to address their own economic needs.
	
虽然魁北克基本上通过控制经济移民建立了自己的 PNP（根据 1991 年加拿大-魁北克协议）；联邦政府不愿复制其与魁北克的协议是跨省实施 PNP 的推动力。	While Quebec had essentially instituted its own PNP through its control of economic immigration (pursuant to the 1991 Canada-Quebec Accord); the federal government’s unwillingness to replicate its agreement with Quebec was a driver towards the implementation of PNPs across provinces.
	
* 1998年，不列颠哥伦比亚省和萨斯喀彻温省加入马尼托巴省实施PNP；	  In 1998, British Columbia and Saskatchewan joined Manitoba in implementing the PNP;
* 1999 年，新不伦瑞克省和纽芬兰及拉布拉多省将效仿他们的 PNP；	  In 1999, both New Brunswick and Newfoundland and Labrador would follow suit with their PNPs;
* 2001 年爱德华王子岛和育空地区将开始他们自己的 PNP；	  In 2001 Prince Edward Island and the Yukon Territory would start their own PNPs;
* 2002 年，新斯科舍省和艾伯塔省都建立了 PNP；	  In 2002 both Nova Scotia and Alberta instituted their PNPs;
* 2005 年安大略省启动了自己的 PNP，如今该省拥有加拿大其他任何省份或地区中最多的提名计划；最后	  2005 saw Ontario start its own PNP, today the province has the most nominee programs out of any other Canadian province or territory; and finally
* 2009 年，西北地区加入其中，实施了自己的 PNP。	  In 2009 the Northwest Territories joined the fold, putting their own PNPs into effect.
	
### 为什么这对你很重要？	Why does this matter to you?
	
PNP 最近出现了大规模增长，成为加拿大在 2022 年欢迎移民的主要方式之一，也可能在 2023 年也是如此。	The PNP has seen massive growth recently, being one of the primary ways that Canada will welcome immigrants in 2022, and likely in 2023 as well.
	
有希望移民的人可能会在调查他们最符合资格的 PNP 类别以及哪些省份可能需要他们时看到很多价值。进一步了解您正在考虑移民的省份的经济目标和劳动条件，将极大地帮助您和您的申请最好地定位于潜在的移民赞助甚至 PR。	Immigrant hopefuls will likely see a lot of value in investigating what PNP stream they would best qualify under, and what provinces may need them. Further understanding the economic goals and labour conditions within a province you are considering immigrating to, will help greatly in positioning yourself and your application best towards potential immigration sponsorship and even PR.
	
申请人可能会发现记住曼尼托巴省（和其他省份，有明显例外）将在 PNP 和经济移民流的帮助下解决他们的经济需求——根据他们的劳动力市场条件和要求这样做。	Applicants may find utility in remembering that Manitoba (and other provinces, with noted exceptions), will address their economic needs with the help of PNPs and economic immigration streams—doing so according to their labour market conditions and requirements.
