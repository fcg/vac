# IRCC 扩大了允许访客获得工作许可的政策，如果他们有有效的工作机会，该政策将一直有效到 2025 年 2 月 28 日。	IRCC extends policy that allows visitors to obtain work permits if they have valid job offers This policy will remain in effect until February 28, 2025.
加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 宣布，任何在加拿大期间收到工作邀请的外国人都可以申请并获得工作许可。	Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) has announced that any foreign national who receives a job offer while in Canada will be able to apply for, and receive, a work permit.
	
这是原定于今天到期的 COVID-19 时代临时公共政策的延伸。	This is an extension of the COVID-19-era temporary public policy that was set to expire today.
	
要有资格申请，希望从这项临时公共政策中受益的申请人必须：	To be eligible to apply, an applicant looking to benefit from this temporary public policy must:
	
- 在申请之日在加拿大拥有有效的访客身份	-   have valid status in Canada as a visitor on the day they apply
- 有一份由劳动力市场影响评估 (LMIA) 或 LMIA 豁免工作提供支持的工作机会	-   have a job offer that is supported by a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) or an LMIA-exempt offer of employment
- 不迟于 2025 年 2 月 28 日提交特定雇主工作许可申请	-   submit an application for an employer-specific work permit no later than February 28, 2025
- 满足所有其他标准的可接受标准	-   meet all other standard admissibility criteria

如果您被接纳为永久居民并且必须具有加拿大就业和社会发展部的积极或中立的劳动力市场影响评估，则有效的工作机会被定义为一年或更长时间的全职非季节性工作的书面邀请（或者该工作是 LMIA 豁免的）。	A valid job offer is defined as a written offer of a full-time, non-seasonal job for one year or more if you are accepted as a permanent resident and must have a positive or neutral Labour Market Impact Assessment  from Employment and Social Development Canada (or the job is LMIA-exempt).
	
LMIA 是雇主向加拿大就业和社会发展部 (ESDC) 提出的申请，以评估雇用外国工人是否会对加拿大经济产生积极、中立或消极的影响。如果 ESDC 认为影响是负面的，雇主将没有资格雇用外国人。	A LMIA is an application that an employer makes to Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) to evaluate if hiring foreign workers will have a positive, neutral or negative impact on the Canadian economy. If ESDC deems the impact is negative, the employer will not be eligible to hire foreign nationals.
	
目前在加拿大拥有访客身份但在过去 12 个月内持有有效工作许可证的任何人都可以按照特殊说明获得临时工作许可，以便在工作许可证申请最终确定之前开始为新雇主工作。	Anyone in Canada who currently has visitor status but has held a valid work permit in the past 12 months can follow special instructions to get interim work authorization to start working for their new employer before their work permit application is finalized.
	
在最初的政策变化之前，申请在加拿大工作的任何人通常需要在抵达前申请工作许可。要在抵达加拿大后获得工作许可，具有访客身份的外国人需要离开该国才能获得许可。此策略使此步骤变得不必要。	Before the initial policy change, anyone applying to work in Canada would generally need to apply for their work permit before arriving. To get a work permit after arriving in Canada, a foreign national with visitor status would need to leave the country to be issued their permit. This policy makes this step unnecessary.
	
### 加拿大大量职位空缺	Canada’s high number of job vacancies
	
该措施最初是为了帮助加拿大雇主填补紧急劳动力短缺，因为当时实施了与 COVID 相关的旅行限制，导致新移民难以从国外抵达。	The measure was initially introduced to help employers in Canada fill urgent labour shortages when COVID related travel restrictions were in place, making it difficult for newcomers to arrive from abroad.
	
加拿大正在努力填补职位空缺并减少劳动力短缺。截至 1 月，加拿大的失业率为 5%，以历史标准衡量处于低水平。	Canada is working towards filling job vacancies and reducing the labour shortage. As of January, Canada’s rate of unemployment stands at 5%, which is low by historic standards.
	
此外，加拿大统计局 2022 年 12 月的数据显示，职位空缺数量从今年早些时候的逾 100 万个总体减少至 848,000 个。尽管如此，一些关键行业仍需要更多员工来填补紧缺职位。例如，医疗保健和社会援助部门有 149,800 个职位空缺，住宿和食品服务部门有 108,000 个职位空缺，零售业有 100,200 个职位空缺。	Additionally, Statistics Canada data from December 2022, shows there was an overall decrease in the number of vacancies to 848,000 from over one million earlier in the year. Still, several key sectors need more employees to fill in-demand positions. For example, there were 149,800 vacancies in the healthcare and social assistance sectors, as well as 108,000 in accommodation and food services and 100.200 in retail trade.
