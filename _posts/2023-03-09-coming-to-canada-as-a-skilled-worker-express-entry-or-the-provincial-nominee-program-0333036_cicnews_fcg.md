# 以技术工人的身份来到加拿大：快速入境还是省提名计划？在这两个项目下申请永久居留权的好处。	Coming to Canada as a skilled worker: Express Entry or the Provincial Nominee Program? The benefits of applying for permanent residence under both programs.
联邦政府和各省和地区可以实施自己独特的移民计划。但是，联邦政府对候选人是否可以获得永久居留权做出最终决定。	The federal government and the provinces and territories can operate their own distinct immigration programs. However, the federal government makes the final decision about whether a candidate can obtain permanent residence.
	
Express Entry 是一个联邦系统，负责管理加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 的申请，是加拿大欢迎经济类移民的主要方式之一。 Express Entry 管理联邦政府运营的众多经济移民计划中的三个，即联邦技术工人计划 (FSWP)、联邦技术贸易计划 (FSTP) 和加拿大经验类计划 (CEC)。	Express Entry is a federal system that manages applications by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) and is one of the main ways Canada welcomes economic class immigration. Express Entry manages three of the many economic immigration programs operated by the federal government, the Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP), the Federal Skilled Trades Program (FSTP) and the Canadian Experience Class (CEC).
	
一旦候选人表达了成为永久居民的兴趣，他们将根据综合排名系统 (CRS) 获得一个分数，该系统用于确定将最成功地定居加拿大并参与加拿大劳动力市场的技术工人。	Once a candidate expresses their interest in becoming a permanent resident, they will receive a score according to the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS), which is used to identify skilled workers that will be most successful settling in Canada and participating in Canada’s labour market.
	
CRS 根据候选人的人力资本、年龄、教育程度、语言技能、工作经验等评估候选人。加拿大政府大约每两周举行一次快速通道抽签，邀请 CRS 分数最高的人成为永久居民。	The CRS evaluates a candidate based on their human capital, assessing age, education, language skills, work experience and more. Roughly every two weeks, the Canadian government holds Express Entry draws inviting those with the highest CRS scores to become permanent residents.
	
省提名计划 (PNP) 是希望移民加拿大并获得永久居民身份的技术工人的一个选择。该计划的目的是通过允许各省和地区寻找满足其地区经济需求的移民候选人来加强省和地区经济。如果被选中，这些候选人将获得省级提名，他们可以使用该提名来支持他们的永久居留申请。	The Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) is an option for skilled workers wanting to immigrate to Canada and get permanent resident status. The purpose of the program is to strengthen provincial and territorial economies by allowing the provinces and territories to find immigration candidates that meet the economic needs of their region. If chosen, these candidates obtain a provincial nomination which they can use to support their application for permanent residence.
	
### 同时申请的好处	The benefits of applying to both
	
希望移民加拿大的技术工人可以提交快速入境资料，同时直接申请 PNP 流。	A skilled worker looking to immigrate to Canada can submit an Express Entry profile and apply directly to a PNP stream at the same time.
	
进入 Express Entry 池的好处之一是候选人可以让省和地区看到他们自己，他们可以查看个人资料并向他们提供申请 PNP 的邀请。如果候选人接受邀请，他们可以向省或地区提交完整的 PNP 申请。	One of the benefits of entering the Express Entry pool is that a candidate can make themselves visible to provinces and territories who can review the profile and provide them with an invitation to apply to their PNP. If a candidate accepts their invitation, they can submit a completed PNP application to the province or territory.
	
申请这两个项目对候选人都非常有利。候选人的初始 Express Entry 排名分数可能不够高，无法收到联邦政府的申请邀请 (ITA)——但他们可以通过申请“增强型”PNP 计划来提高分数。	Applying to both programs can be very beneficial to a candidate. It is possible that the candidates initial Express Entry ranking score may not be high enough to receive an Invitation to Apply (ITA) by the federal government – but they can increase their score by applying to an “enhanced” PNP program.
	
符合快速入境计划资格的申请人可以表明他们希望在特定省份定居。省政府可以决定候选人是否适合该省。如果是这种情况，该省将向申请人发出意向通知，这意味着该申请人被邀请申请省提名。	An applicant who is eligible for an Express Entry program can indicate that they would like to settle in a particular province. The provincial government can decide if a candidate will be a good fit for the province. If this is the case, the province will issue a notification of interest to the applicant, meaning that the applicant is invited to apply for provincial nomination.
	
根据 Express Entry 的 CRS，省级提名会使 Express Entry 候选人获得额外的 600 分，这基本上可以保证获得 ITA。	Under Express Entry’s CRS, a provincial nomination results in an Express Entry candidate receiving an additional 600 points, which essentially guarantees receiving an ITA.
	
### 我可以在这两个项目的任何地方定居吗？	Can I settle anywhere under both programs?
	
加拿大宪法规定，加拿大公民和永久居民享有“流动权”，即他们可以在国内自由流动，在任何省份定居，并在任何省份谋生。	The Canadian Constitution specifies that Canadian citizens and permanent residents have “Mobility Rights” meaning they can move freely within the country, take up residence in any province and pursue the gaining of a livelihood in any province.
	
当您申请省提名时，您表明您真正打算在该省定居，因为各省提名候选人为该省的经济发展做出贡献。尽管如此，由于您的流动权，法律允许您搬到另一个省份。	When you apply for a provincial nomination, you indicate your genuine intention to settle in that province, as provinces nominate candidates to contribute to the economic development of the province. Despite this, you are legally permitted to move to another province due to your Mobility Rights.
	
但是，我们强烈建议您在提交 PNP 申请时诚实说明您的居住意图。我们还鼓励您在决定搬到其他地方之前，努力住在接纳您的省份。	However, you are strongly encouraged to be honest about your residency intentions when you submit your PNP application. You are also encouraged to make an effort to live in the province that admitted you before deciding to move somewhere else.
	
就获得永久居留权后可以定居的地方而言，快速通道更加灵活。如果您在没有省提名的情况下通过快速通道获得永久居留权，则您没有承诺居住在除魁北克省以外的任何特定省份，魁北克省有自己的移民系统。	Express Entry is more flexible in terms of places you can settle once granted permanent residence. If you are granted permanent residence through Express Entry without a provincial nomination, you have not committed to residing in any particular province except for Quebec, which operates its own immigration system.
