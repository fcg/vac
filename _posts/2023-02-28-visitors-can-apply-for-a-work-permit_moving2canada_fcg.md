## 加拿大的访客可以继续申请工作许可证，而无需离开该国，只要他们有有效的工作机会。	Visitors in Canada can continue to apply for a work permit without needing to leave the country, provided they have a valid job offer.
	
该措施还适用于在过去 12 个月内持有工作许可证并且仍持访客签证留在加拿大的人。	The measure also applies to people who held a work permit within the last 12 months and who are still in Canada on a visitor visa.
	
这项 COVID 时代的临时公共政策原定于 2023 年 2 月 28 日到期。然而，它已延长至 2025 年 2 月 28 日。它允许游客无需离开该国即可在加拿大找到工作。	This COVID-era temporary public policy was supposed to expire February 28, 2023. However, it has been extended until February 28, 2025. It allows visitors to get a job in Canada without having to leave the country.
	
在加拿大推出此政策之前，您通常需要在抵达加拿大之前申请初始工作许可。如果您在获得工作许可时已经以访客身份在加拿大，则您需要离开加拿大才能获得工作许可。	Before Canada introduced this policy, you would typically need to apply for your initial work permit before arriving in Canada. If you were already in Canada with visitor status when approved for a work permit, you would need to leave the country in order to get your work permit.
	
有了这项政策，就没有必要离开加拿大了。	With this policy in place, leaving Canada isn’t necessary.
	
### 如何获得资格	How to be eligible
	
要有资格申请，希望从这项临时公共政策中受益的申请人必须满足以下要求：	To be eligible to apply, an applicant looking to benefit from this temporary public policy must meet the following requirements:
	
- 您需要在申请当天在加拿大拥有有效的访客身份	-   You need to have valid status in Canada as a visitor on the day you apply
- 您需要有一份由劳动力市场影响评估 (LMIA) 或 LMIA 豁免工作提供支持的工作机会	-   You need to have a job offer that is supported by a labour market impact assessment (LMIA) or an LMIA-exempt offer of employment
- 您需要在 2025 年 2 月 28 日之前提交特定雇主工作许可申请	-   You need to submit an application for an employer-specific work permit no later than February 28, 2025
- 并且，您必须满足所有其他标准的可接受性标准（即刑事和医疗可接受性）	-   And, you must meet all other standard admissibility criteria (i.e. criminal and medical admissibility)
	
当前拥有访客身份但在过去 12 个月内持有有效工作许可证的申请人可以按照 IRCC 网站上的特别说明获得所谓的“临时工作授权”，以便在工作许可证申请最终确定之前开始为新雇主工作.	Applicants who currently have visitor status but who have held a valid work permit in the past 12 months can follow special instructions on the IRCC website to get what’s called “interim work authorization” to start working for their new employer before their work permit application is finalized.
	
### 加拿大职位空缺	Job vacancies in Canada
	
在经济扩张时期，加拿大的雇主面临着严重的劳动力短缺问题。通过保留这项政策，外国公民可以在持有访客签证的同时在加拿大找到工作，而不必离开。	Employers in Canada are facing significant labour shortages, during a period of economic expansion. By leaving this policy in place, foreign nationals can get a job in Canada while on a visitor visa, and not have to leave.
	
这不仅支持可能想要工作并最终移民到加拿大的新移民，而且还减轻了有职位空缺的雇主的负担。	This not only supports newcomers who may want to work and eventually immigrate to Canada, but it also eases the burden on employers who have job vacancies.
	
根据加拿大统计局最新的职位空缺报告，加拿大有超过80万个职位空缺。空缺率最高的是住宿和餐饮服务以及医疗保健行业。	According to Statistics Canada’s most recent job vacancies report, there are more than 800,000 job vacancies in Canada. The highest vacancy rates are in the accommodation and food services, as well as the healthcare sectors.
