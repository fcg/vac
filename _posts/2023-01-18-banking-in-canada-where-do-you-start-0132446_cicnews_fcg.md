您刚刚来到加拿大——这里有很多新鲜和不同之处。这包括办理银行业务和在需要时轻松取用资金。	You’ve just come to Canada – and so much is new and different here. That includes doing banking and getting easy access to your money when you need it.
	
在哪里？作为新人，谁最了解您的需求？抵达加拿大后，开设银行账户是您需要做的最重要的事情之一。加拿大的银行业务可能与您所在国家/地区的银行业务截然不同。但选择可能很复杂。哪一个账户？	On arrival in Canada, opening a bank account is one of the most important things you’ll need to do. But the choices can be complicated. Which accounts? Where? Who will best understand your needs as a newcomer? Banking in Canada is likely to be quite different from banking in your home country.

### **您在加拿大需要什么银行账户？**	**What Bank Accounts Will You Need in Canada?**
	
开始您的加拿大银行业务之旅的最佳方式是开设三种重要类型的账户：支票账户、储蓄账户和信用卡。我们将在下面详细解释所有这三个。	The best way to begin your Canadian banking journey is by opening three important types of accounts: a chequing account, a savings account, and a credit card. We will explain all three of these in detail below.
	
要开设这些账户，您首先需要提供一些基本形式的身份证明来验证您的法定姓名，以及您的加拿大地址和电话号码，以完成您的账户资料。您将被要求出示官方政府身份证明，例如护照、驾照或政府签发的其他形式的身份证件，对于某些事情，您可能还需要提供登陆文件、学习许可或工作许可。	To open these accounts, you’ll first need to provide some basic forms of identification verifying your legal name, as well as your Canadian address and phone number in order to complete your account profile. You will be asked to show official government identification, such as a passport, driver’s license or another form of government-issued ID, and for certain things you may also need to provide your landing papers, study permit or work permit.
	
以下是在加拿大开展银行业务的两个简单步骤：	Here are two simple steps to take to begin banking in Canada:
	
**第 1 步：了解加拿大支票账户和储蓄账户的区别——以及如何使用它们**	**Step 1: Understand the difference between a Chequing and a Savings account in Canada – and how to use them**
	
在加拿大，有两种类型的个人存款账户：支票账户和储蓄账户。大多数新加拿大人可能两者都想要。让我们对两者进行快速比较。	In Canada, there are two types of personal deposit accounts: a chequing account, and a savings account. Most new Canadians may want both. Let’s do a quick comparison between the two.
	
**支票账户**是用于日常交易的账户。这包括购买杂货、支付账单、租金以及自动存款交易，例如让您的雇主将您的工资直接存入您的账户。您可以通过借记卡访问您的帐户，从自动柜员机 (ATM) 或银行分行提取现金，并可用于在商店购物和在线购物。	**A chequing account** is an account used for regular, daily transactions. This includes buying groceries, paying bills, rent as well as auto-deposit transactions such as having your employer deposit your salary directly into your account. Your account can be accessed through a debit card to withdraw cash from Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) or bank branches, and can be used to make purchases in stores and through online shopping.
	
支票账户通常不支付利息。它们可能包括月费以及交易费用，例如提款、支票、账单支付和购买。寻找一个包含您认为需要的正确月度交易次数的支票账户。更好的是，您会发现一些无限交易的支票账户，例如 TD Unlimited 支票账户——如果您认为自己可能有很多交易，这是一个很好的选择。	Chequing accounts generally don’t pay interest. They may include a monthly fee along with a fee for transactions, such as withdrawals, cheques, bill payments, and purchases. Look for a chequing account that includes the right number of monthly transactions you think you will need. Even better, you will find some chequing accounts that come with unlimited transactions, such as the TD Unlimited Chequing Account – a great option if you think you may have a lot of transactions.
	
**储蓄账户**用于存入您不需要立即使用的资金。例如，您可能希望为教育、买房、度假或婚礼以及发生意外（如汽车抛锚）时进行储蓄。与支票账户不同，储蓄账户确实会给您带来利息，因此只有在未雨绸缪或人生里程碑时才明智地从中取款。您留在这个账户中的钱会产生利息——这是额外的钱，会在您的账户中增加，以帮助您为未来的目标储蓄。	**A savings account** is used for setting aside money you don’t need right away. For example, you may wish to save for education, buying a home, paying for a vacation or a wedding, and for when the unexpected happens – like a car breakdown. Unlike chequing accounts, savings accounts do pay you interest, so only withdraw from them wisely for a rainy day or a life milestone. The money you leave in this account will gain interest – that’s extra money that will grow in your account to help you save for your future goals.
	
**您可以从 TD 的三个储蓄账户中选择一个来实现您的储蓄目标：**	**You can choose from one of TD’s three savings accounts to achieve your savings goals:**
	
* TD日常储蓄账户	  TD Every Day Savings Account
* TD ePremium 储蓄账户	  TD ePremium Savings Account
* TD高息储蓄账户	  TD High Interest Savings Account

**第二步：申请加拿大信用卡**	**Step 2: Apply for a Canadian credit card**
	
信用卡是一种可用于购物、支付账单或根据卡提取现金的卡。将信用卡视为一种短期贷款的最简单方法。当您开设信用卡账户时，您的信用卡公司会为您设定一个信用额度。根据该限额，您的信用卡允许您借入资金进行购买并在以后付款。	A credit card is a card that can be used to make purchases, pay bills or depending on the card, withdraw cash. The simplest way to think of a credit card is as a type of short term loan. When you open a credit card account, your credit card company gives you a set credit limit. Based on that limit, your credit card allows you to borrow funds to make purchases and pay for them later.
	
获得加拿大信用卡有很多优势。拥有良好的信用在加拿大很重要，因为它可以帮助您申请房屋抵押贷款、贷款或租房或出租公寓。建立信用的一个好方法是申请信用卡。定期使用信用卡并每月还清信用卡有助于建立信用记录。拥有信用卡还可以让您轻松购物，在某些情况下，还可以根据您的消费获得奖励。	Getting a Canadian credit card has many advantages. Having good credit is important in Canada as it may assist you when applying for a home mortgage, a loan, or renting a home or apartment. A good way to build credit is to apply for a credit card. Using your credit card regularly and paying it off each month can help to build your credit history. Having a credit card also makes it easy for you to make purchases and, in some cases, receive rewards on what you spend.
	
如果您正在寻找您的第一张加拿大信用卡，了解不同信用卡的工作原理以及如何利用它们对您有利非常重要。	If you’re looking for your first Canadian credit card, it’s important to understand how different cards work and how to use them to your advantage.
	
TD 提供种类繁多的信用卡，提供不同的礼遇和令人兴奋的奖励。	TD offers a wide variety of credit cards with different perks and exciting rewards.
