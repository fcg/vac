您是否完成了学位并正在寻找您的研究领域的机会？加拿大可能是开启职业生涯的最佳地点之一，尤其是如果您是 STEM 或医学专业的毕业生。由于技能短缺，加拿大对这些关键和创新职业的需求量很大，加拿大不断招募外国人才，通过像 IEC 的**年轻专业人员**这样的工作许可流来帮助促进经济发展。	Did you complete your degree and are looking for opportunities in your field of study? Canada is probably one of the best places to kickstart your career especially if you’re a STEM or medical graduate. These crucial and innovative occupations are in high demand in the country due to skills shortages and Canada constantly recruits foreign talent to help boost the economy through work permit streams like the **Young Professionals** of the IEC.
	
葡萄牙的大专毕业生可能有资格获得 **年轻专业人士** 类别，这使他们能够在加拿大寻求工作机会，从而促进他们的专业发展。要获得资格，您必须拥有加拿大雇主提供的与您的资格相关的有效工作**。	Post-secondary graduates in Portugal may qualify for the **Young Professionals** stream which allows them to pursue work opportunities in Canada that leads to their professional development. To qualify, you must have a valid job** offer** from a Canadian employer that’s related to your qualifications.

您是否仍在学习但需要完成实习或工作实习作为学术课程的一部分？如果是，那为什么不在加拿大获得宝贵的工作经验呢？	Are you still studying but need to complete an internship or work placement as part of your academic curriculum? If yes, then why not gain valuable work experience in Canada?  
	
葡萄牙学生将能够通过申请与其学习领域直接相关的实习项目在加拿大工作。 **国际合作**流是一个很好的机会，甚至在您毕业之前就可以接触国际工作，并建立联系，一旦您完成资格认证，就可以在加拿大找到一份永久性工作！	Portuguese students will be able to work in Canada by applying for internship programs that are directly related to their fields of study.

最后但同样重要的是，我们有 **Working Holiday** 流。它是迄今为止最受欢迎的 IEC 类别，深受葡萄牙青年的追捧，但每年的工作签证数量有限。今年，有**1,750** 工作假期签证可供葡萄牙公民申请。这意味着竞争非常激烈，通常满足所有要求并拥有完整 IEC 档案的候选人是最成功的。	Last but definitely not least we have the **Working Holiday** stream. It’s by far the most popular IEC category and highly sought after by Portuguese youth but there is a limited amount of work visas available each year. This year, there are**1,750** Working Holiday Visas up for grabs for Portuguese citizens. This means that competition is stiff, and typically candidates who meet all of the requirements and have a complete IEC profile are the most successful.
