在这篇文章中，我们将了解雅思口语考试的三个部分、评估标准，并建议您如何提高每个部分的表现。	In this post, we will look at the three parts of the IELTS Speaking test, the assessment criteria, and suggest how you can improve your performance in each part.
	
**雅思口语考试的形式是什么？**	**What is the format of the IELTS Speaking test?**
	
口语考试时长11-14分钟，分为三个部分。每个部分都旨在反映您在英语环境中生活、工作或学习时可能需要的一项技能。	The Speaking test lasts for 11-14 minutes and there are three parts. Each part is designed to reflect a skill you may need when you live, work or study in an English-speaking environment.

那么如何提高雅思词汇量呢？我们将在下面探讨一些简单的想法。	So how can you improve your vocabulary for IELTS? We’ll explore some simple ideas below.
	
**第 1 部分发生了什么？**	**What happens in Part 1?**
	
测试的第一部分旨在让您轻松自在。考官首先会问你一些关于你的工作、学习、你的家乡或祖国的问题。例如：	The first part of the test is designed to put you at ease. The examiner will start by asking you questions about your work, study, your hometown, or home country. For example:
	
_让我们谈谈你的家乡或村庄。_	_Let’s talk about your hometown or village._
	
* 它是什么样的地方？_	  _What kind of place is it?_
* _你所在的城镇/村庄最有趣的地方是什么？_	  _What’s the most interesting part of your town/village?_
* 你镇/村里的人做什么工作？_	  _What kind of jobs do the people in your town/village do?_
* _你会说这是一个居住的好地方吗？ （为什么？）_	  _Would you say it’s a good place to live? (Why?)_

随后将提出有关一般日常话题的问题，例如爱好、宠物、天气、假期、运动、音乐等。	This will then be followed up with questions on general, everyday topics such as hobbies, pets, the weather, holidays, sport, music, etc.
	
在这部分，尝试通过给出理由和例子来扩展和扩展你的答案。	In this part, try to extend and expand your answers by giving reasons and examples.
	
_考官：你喜欢什么样的音乐？_	_Examiner: What kind of music do you like?_
	
_候选人：我喜欢流行音乐，因为它通常很乐观，如果我感到疲倦，它有助于提振我的心情。_	_Candidate: I like pop music as it’s generally upbeat and helps to lift my mood if I’m feeling tired._
	
_考官：你更喜欢玩还是看运动？_	_Examiner: Do you prefer to play or watch sports?_
	
_候选人：我想参加体育运动，尤其是足球，但我真的没有时间，所以只要有空，我就会在电视上看我最喜欢的足球队。_	_Candidate: I’d like to play sport, especially football, but I don’t really have the time so whenever I can I watch my favourite football team on TV._
	
**第 2 部分会发生什么？**	**What happens in Part 2?**
	
这部分侧重于您就给定主题进行长篇演讲的能力，模拟在工作或大学中的演讲。您将获得一张主题卡，您将被要求描述一些事情或谈论一次经历——然而，许多主题是两者的结合。您还有一分钟的时间来准备您要说的话。利用这段时间在卡片上记下要点。按照与卡片上的要点相同的顺序组织你的答案，因为它会使你说的更连贯。	This part focuses on your ability to speak at length on a given topic, simulating giving a presentation at work or university. You will be given a topic card and you will be asked to describe something or talk about an experience – however, many of the topics are a combination of the two. You are also given one minute to prepare what you are going to say. Use this time to make notes on the points on the card. Organise your answer in the same order as the points on the card as it will make what you say more coherent.
	
你可能会得到一个你没有太多想法的话题。不要惊慌——发挥创意！考官不会对你说的话进行事实核查，他们只对你如何回答任务感兴趣。	You might get a topic that you don’t have many ideas on. Don’t panic – get creative! The examiner isn’t going to fact-check what you say, and they are only interested in how you answer the task.
	
请记住，您可以在讲话时查看笔记。 Part 2 持续 3-4 分钟，包括准备时间，时间到了考官会告诉你。	Remember you can look at your notes when you speak. Part 2 lasts for 3-4 minutes, including the preparation time, and the examiner will tell you when your time is up.
	
示例响应	Sample response
	
**第 3 部分发生了什么？**	**What happens in Part 3?**
	
在这部分中，将测试您表达和论证您的观点以及分析、讨论和推测与第 2 部分主题广泛相关的各种问题的能力。这些问题将更加笼统和抽象，类似于您在大学或工作中可能遇到的讨论类型。	In this part, you will be tested on your ability to express and justify your opinions and to analyse, discuss and speculate on a variety of issues broadly linked to the topic in Part 2.  The questions will be more general and abstract, similar to the types of discussion you may encounter at university or work.
	
例子：	Example:
	
_让我们首先考虑人们的价值观是如何改变的。_	_Let’s consider first of all how people’s values have changed._
	
* 在你的国家，什么样的事情赋予人们地位？_	  _What kind of things give status to people in your country?_
* _自你父母时代以来，情况有变化吗？_	  _Have things changed since your parents’ time?_
	
_最后说说广告的作用吧。_	_Finally, let’s talk about the role of advertising._
	
* _你认为广告会影响人们购买什么吗？_	  _Do you think advertising influences what people buy?_
	
仔细听考官的问题，说话时尽量使用相同的时态。您还可以使用以下一些短语为自己争取一些时间来思考：	Listen carefully to the examiner’s questions and try to use the same tenses when you speak. You can also buy yourself some time to think by using some of these phrases:
	
让我想想， 。 . ._	_Let me think, . . ._
	
_我不确定如何回答，但是。 . ._	_I’m not sure how to answer that, but . . ._
	
_我以前从未真正想过这个，也许。 . ._	_I’ve never really thought about this before, perhaps . . ._
	
_这很难回答。 . ._	_That’s quite difficult to answer . . ._
	
_这是一个相当复杂的问题。 . ._	_That’s quite a complex issue . . ._
	
_这是一个有趣的问题。 . ._	_That’s an interesting question . . ._
	
_样本响应_	_Sample response_
	
**评估标准——考官在寻找什么？**	**Assessment criteria – what are the examiners looking for?**
	
口语部分用于评估您的英语口语使用情况。评估范围广泛的口语技能，例如：	The Speaking section is used to assess your use of spoken English. A wide range of speaking skills are assessed, such as:
	
* 您通过回答一系列问题（第 1 部分）就日常话题、共同经历和情况交流意见和信息的能力	  your ability to communicate opinions and information on everyday topics and common experiences and situations by answering a range of questions (Part 1)
* 您使用适当的语言和连贯地组织想法就给定主题进行详尽发言的能力（第 2 部分）	  your ability to speak at length on a given topic using appropriate language and organising ideas coherently (Part 2)
* 您表达和证明观点以及分析、讨论和推测问题的能力（第 3 部分）。	  your ability to express and justify opinions and to analyse, discuss and speculate about issues (Part 3).
	
测试会被记录下来，考官会根据以下标准给您 0-9 分。	The test is recorded, and examiners will give you a score from 0-9 on the following criteria.
	
**流畅和连贯**	**Fluency and Coherence**
	
这会考察您说话的轻松和流利程度，您将想法联系起来的能力，以及您形成连贯和连贯的演讲的能力。	This looks at how easily and fluently you speak, how well you are able to link your ideas, and how well you form coherent and connected speech.
	
**词汇资源**	**Lexical Resource**
	
这着眼于您使用词汇的范围和精确度，以及您表达您对给定主题的意思、想法和感受的能力。	This looks at the range and precision of vocabulary you use, and how well you are able to express what you mean, think and feel on the given topic.
	
**语法范围和准确性**	**Grammatical Range and Accuracy**
	
这着眼于您使用的结构范围以及您能够准确、恰当地使用它们的能力。	This looks at the range of structures you use and how well you are able to use them accurately and appropriately.

这着眼于您说话的能力，以及您使用一系列发音特征来传达意思的能力。重要的是要注意口音是**不**评估的。	This looks at your ability to speak comprehensibly and how well you are able to use a range of pronunciation features to communicate meaning. It is important to note that accent is **not** assessed.

如何准备雅思口语部分：	How you can prepare for the IELTS Speaking section:
	
**听自己说话**	**Listen to yourself speaking**
	
您可以练习的方法之一是记录自己对示例问题的回答。回听并注意以下事项：	One of the ways you can practice is by recording yourself responding to sample questions. Listen back and pay attention to the following:
	
**词汇**	**Vocabulary**
	
你是否使用了各种特定主题的词汇？想想你可以用来改进答案的单词和短语。	Did you use a variety of topic-specific vocabulary? Think of words and phrases that you could use to improve the answer.
	
**语法**	**Grammar**
	
你使用了多种时态吗？你犯了很多错误吗？想一想如何提高您所说内容的语法范围和准确性。	Did you use a variety of tenses? Did you make a lot of mistakes? Think of how you can improve the grammatical range and accuracy of what you said.
	
记下您想到的想法，并在词汇集（与特定主题相关的单词和短语）中保留词汇记录。	Make a note of the ideas you come up with and keep a vocabulary record in lexical sets (words and phrases connected to a particular topic).
	
**最后，说，说，说！**	**Finally, speak, speak, speak!**
	
抓住一切机会练习说英语！花尽可能多的时间与老师、同学或也会说英语的朋友交谈。如果有朋友也在考，可以一起练习，扮演考官和考生的角色。在测试本身中，想象您正在与朋友交谈并尝试放松。祝你好运！	Take every opportunity to practice speaking English! Spend as much time as you can talking to a teacher, classmate or a friend who also speaks English. If you have friend who is also taking the test, you can practice together by taking the role of the examiner and test taker. In the test itself, imagine you are talking to a friend and try to relax. Good luck!
