几十年来，来自国外的看护人在支持加拿大家庭方面发挥了关键作用。认识到迫切需要护理支持，加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 宣布，将有资格获得永久居留权的护理人员的加拿大工作经验从 24 个月减少到 12 个月。看护人及其家人现在将受益于更快的永久居留权。	For decades, caregivers from abroad have played a critical role in supporting families in Canada. Recognizing the urgent need for caregiving support, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) has announced that Canadian work experience required for a caregiver to qualify for permanent residence is being reduced from 24 months to 12 months. Caregivers and their families will now benefit from a faster path to permanent residence.
	
此外，现有的看护人途径下的一些名额已预留给已经通过之前的工作许可在加拿大拥有工作经验的看护人，以便他们能够申请永久居留权。	In addition, some spaces under the existing caregiver pathways have been reserved for caregivers who already have work experience in Canada from a previous work permit so that they are able to apply for permanent residence.
	
标准的转变将适用于来自家庭托儿服务提供者 (HCCP) 试点和家庭支持工作者 (HSW) 试点的申请人，包括 IRCC 已经收到申请的申请人以及五年剩余时间内的潜在申请人飞行员。自2019年试点启动以来，已有近1600名看护者及其家属成为永久居民。仅2022年一年，就有近1100名看护者及其家属通过这两个试点成为永久居民。该变更将于 2023 年 4 月 30 日生效，并且对已经申请的看护人具有追溯力。	The shift in criteria will apply to applicants from both the Home Child Care Provider (HCCP) pilot and the Home Support Worker (HSW) pilot, including those whose applications have already been received by IRCC and prospective applicants for the remainder of the five‑year pilots. Since the launch of the pilots in 2019, nearly 1,600 caregivers and their family members have become permanent residents. In 2022 alone, nearly 1,100 caregivers and their family members became permanent residents through the two pilots. The change will be effective as of April 30, 2023, and will be retrospective for caregivers who have already applied.
	
此次更新预计将使目前正在处理的大约 90% 的申请受益，这对刚起步的护理人员和一直在加拿大提供护理的人员来说都是一个优势。	This update is expected to benefit around 90% of applications currently in processing, an advantage for both the caregivers who are just starting out and those who have been providing care in Canada.
