“双重意图”是指有意前往加拿大进行临时和永久居留。虽然双重意图是合法的，但它会使申请临时居民签证变得更加复杂。	‘Dual intent’ refers to the intention to come to Canada for both temporary and permanent residence. While having dual intent is legitimate, it can make applying for a temporary resident visa more complicated.
	
未能证明真正的双重意图是临时居民签证拒签的常见原因。这个问题通常会影响海外配偶担保申请人，甚至可能会出现在提交了快速入境资料的申请人身上。	Failure to demonstrate genuine dual intent is a common reason for temporary resident visa refusal. This issue often affects overseas spousal sponsorship applicants and can even arise for applicants with a submitted Express Entry profile.
		
什么是加拿大移民的双重意图？	What is dual intent in Canadian immigration?
	
双重意图本质上是指外国人有两种意图——一种是永久居留身份，另一种是临时居留身份。在加拿大申请临时居留签证，并且已经申请或已经表明有意申请加拿大永久居留权的外国公民，证明了双重意图。	Dual intent essentially means a foreign national has two intents – one for permanent residence status and one for temporary residence status. Foreign nationals that apply for a temporary resident visa in Canada, and have already applied for, or have shown their intention to apply for, permanent residence in Canada, demonstrate dual intent.
	
这也可能适用于已提交加拿大快速入境资料的候选人，因为这样做表明申请人有意在加拿大永久定居。	This may also apply to candidates that have submitted a Canadian Express Entry profile since doing so demonstrates an applicant’s intention to settle permanently in Canada.
	
双重意图如何影响我的加拿大临时居留申请？	How can dual intent affect my Canadian temporary residence application?
	
要申请临时居留签证（访问、学习或工作），外国公民必须证明他们打算在授权逗留结束前离开加拿大。对于已经确定他们计划在加拿大永久定居的申请人来说，这通常更难证明。	To apply for a temporary residence visa (visit, study, or work), foreign nationals must demonstrate their intent to leave Canada by the end of their authorized stay. For applicants that have already established that they plan to settle permanently in Canada, this is often harder to prove.
	
换句话说，双重意图通常与申请人临时来加拿大必须满足的条件相矛盾。	In other words, dual intent often contradicts the conditions that applicants must meet to come to Canada temporarily.
	
如果我已经申请了永久居留权，我还可以作为临时居民来加拿大吗？	Can I still come to Canada as a temporary resident if I’ve applied for permanent residence?
	
尽管这看起来有些矛盾，但如果个人能够证明他们具有真正的双重意图，则他们可以获得临时居留权和永久居留权。在决定是否签发临时签证时，签证官必须评估申请人是否有真正打算在签证到期后离开该国。即使申请人正在申请永久居留权，如果签证官确信申请人会遵守签发临时签证的条款，他们也可能会签发临时签证。	Although it might seem contradictory, individuals can receive both temporary residence and permanent residence if they can prove that they have genuine dual intent. When deciding whether to issue a temporary visa, visa officers must assess whether the applicant has the genuine intent to leave the country upon the expiration of their visa. Even if the applicant has an ongoing application for permanent residence, the visa officer may grant a temporary visa if they are convinced that the applicant will respect the terms on which the temporary visa is issued.
	
如果申请人无法说服签证官他们的双重意图是真实的，签证官可能会拒绝临时签证申请。	If the applicant is not able to convince the visa officer that their dual intent is genuine, the officer may refuse the temporary visa application.
	
在这些类型的情况下，签证官可能会怀疑申请人申请临时签证只是为了在处理永久居留申请时在加拿大居住。因此，他们无意在临时签证到期时离开该国。被拒绝临时签证并不意味着申请人的永久居留签证将被拒绝。	In these types of cases, the visa officer might suspect that the applicant is only applying for a temporary visa in order to live in Canada while their application for permanent residence is processed. Therefore, they have no intent to leave the country when their temporary visa expires. Being refused a temporary visa does not mean that the applicant’s permanent residence visa will be refused.
	
国际学生	International students
	
希望在加拿大学习的外国公民必须说服签证官他们打算尊重临时签证的条件。即，他们打算在学生签证到期时离开该国。	Foreign nationals who wish to study in Canada must convince the visa officer that they intend to respect the conditions of a temporary visa. Namely, that they intend to leave the country at the expiry of their student visa.
	
但是，加拿大联邦政府有兴趣在完成学业后留住国际学生。毕业后工作许可和国际学生省提名计划等项目得到推广，使国际学生在完成学习项目后更容易留在加拿大。这似乎与国际学生获得学生签证必须满足的条件直接矛盾。	However, the federal government of Canada has an interest in retaining international students following the completion of their studies. Programs like the Post-Graduation Work Permit, and Provincial Nominee Programs for international students, are promoted to make it easier for international students to remain in Canada once their program of study is completed. This would seem to directly contradict the conditions that international students must meet in order to be issued a student visa.
	
这是适用双重意图的常见示例。申请学习许可时，外国公民必须清楚地证明他或她打算遵守学习许可持有人在授权逗留期限结束前离开加拿大的要求。该外国人在加拿大学习之前或期间申请永久居留的愿望并不自动排除他们获得临时签证的可能性，只要他们满足此条件。	This is a common example of where dual intent applies. When applying for a study permit, the foreign national must clearly demonstrate that he or she intends to respect the requirement that study permit holders leave Canada by the end of the period authorized for their stay. That foreign national’s desire to apply for permanent residence before or during the period of study in Canada does not automatically preclude them from being issued a temporary visa, as long as they meet this condition.
	
配偶担保	Spousal sponsorship
	
在评估临时居留申请时，签证官通常会查看申请人是否与加拿大有密切联系，以确定他们是否有可能在许可证到期时离开加拿大。因此，对于正在进行海外配偶担保申请的申请人，临时居民签证 (TRV) 的拒签率非常高。	When assessing temporary residence applications, visa officers often look at whether the applicant has strong ties to Canada to determine whether they would likely leave Canada by the time their permit expires. For this reason, the refusal rate of temporary resident visas (TRV) to applicants with an ongoing overseas spousal sponsorship application is very high.
	
虽然配偶担保申请人有可能获得 TRV，但由于他们与加拿大的紧密联系，这可能会变得更加困难。	While it is possible for spousal sponsorship applicants to receive a TRV, it can be made much more difficult due to their strong ties to Canada.
	
如何证明真正的双重意图	How to demonstrate genuine dual intent
	
如果永久居留申请被拒绝，签证官必须区分持有真正双重意图的申请人和无意离开加拿大的申请人。由申请人说服签证官他们有双重意图。	Visa officers must distinguish between applicants who hold genuine dual intent and those who have no intention of leaving Canada if the application for permanent residence is refused. It’s up to the applicant to convince the visa officer that they have dual intent.
	
在确定申请人是否对临时签证申请有真正的双重意图时，官员会考虑几个因素，包括：	When determining whether an applicant has genuine dual intent on a temporary visa application, an officer looks at several factors, including:
	
* 他们计划在加拿大停留多长时间	  How long do they plan to stay in Canada
* 他们在本国是否有牢固的联系或义务（例如工作、家庭、财产）	  Whether they have strong ties or obligations in their home country (ex. work, family, property)
* 他们临时来加拿大的原因	  Their reason for coming to Canada temporarily
* 他们之前是否在加拿大或任何其他国家逾期居留	  Whether they have previously overstayed a visa, in Canada, or any other country
	
在准备临时居留申请时，重要的是要解决上述因素，以帮助证明一个人真正的双重意图。	When preparing an application for temporary residence, it is important to address the above factors to help demonstrate one’s genuine dual intent.
	
如果您在加拿大期间的永久居留申请获得批准，则您无需在临时身份结束时离开。一旦您成为加拿大永久居民 (PR)，只要您继续履行 PR 义务，您就可以留在加拿大。	If your application for permanent residence is approved while you are in Canada, you do not need to leave at the end of your temporary status. Once you become a Canadian permanent resident (PR), you can stay in Canada as long as you continue to meet PR obligations.
