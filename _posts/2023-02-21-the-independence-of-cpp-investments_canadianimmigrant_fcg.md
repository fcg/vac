当 CPP Investments 于 1997 年成立时，加拿大立法者坚持制定规则以防止政治干预决策，包括投资选择。这种独立性仍然坚定不移。	When CPP Investments was created in 1997, Canadian legislators insisted on rules to prevent political interference with decision-making, including investment selection. That independence remains firmly in place.
	
CPP Investments 与联邦和省政府保持一定距离，也就是说民选官员对 CPP Investments 的日常管理没有发言权。它还独立于加拿大退休金计划 (CPP) 本身运作。其独立、高素质、专业的董事会对组织进行监督。	CPP Investments operates at arm’s length from federal and provincial governments, which is to say that elected officials have no say in the day-to-day management of CPP Investments. It also works independent of the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) itself. Its independent, highly qualified, professional Board of Directors provides oversight of the organization.
	
CPP Investments 的工作是帮助 CPP 履行其对向基金捐款和/或受益的加拿大人的义务。它通过将资产投资于基金来实现回报最大化，而不承担不必要的风险，以 CPP 捐助者和受益人的最佳利益来管理基金。	CPP Investments’ job is to help the CPP meet its obligations to Canadians who contribute and/or benefit from the Fund. It does this by investing assets in the Fund to maximize returns without taking unnecessary risk, managing the Fund in the best interest of CPP contributors and beneficiaries.
	
同样重要的是，CPP 基金资产与政府基金分开存放。联邦和省政府都不能使用 CPP 基金——这笔钱只能用于支付 CPP 福利和相关费用。	Just as important, CPP Fund assets are kept separate from government funds. Neither federal nor provincial governments can access the CPP Fund — that money is only available to pay CPP benefits and related costs.
	
#### **严格问责**	**Rigorous accountability**
	
确保所有这些都透明是很重要的。 CPP Investments 及时向公众披露重大活动。这包括新投资、合作伙伴关系、季度和年度财务业绩以及可能影响其声誉的事项。 CPP Investments 的年度报告提交议会，每两年举行一次公开会议。	Making sure that there is transparency around all of this is important. CPP Investments makes timely disclosure to the public of material activities. That includes new investments, partnerships, quarterly and annual financial results and matters that might impact its reputation. CPP Investments’ annual report is tabled in parliament and it holds public meetings every two years.
	
CPP Investments 的管理向其董事会报告，而不是向政府报告。董事会批准其投资政策，确定战略方向（与 CPP Investments 管理层合作）并批准有关其运营方式的关键决策。反过来，董事会在严格的问责制度下对他们的表现负责，其中包括向担任 CPP 管理员的联邦和省级财政部长报告。	CPP Investments’ management reports to its Board of Directors, not to governments. The Board approves its investment policies, determines strategic direction (in collaboration with CPP Investments management) and approves key decisions about how it operates. The Board is in turn accountable for their performance under a rigorous accountability regime which includes reporting to the federal and provincial Finance Ministers who serve as the stewards of the CPP.
	
在内部，CPP Investments 由具有长期全球投资管理领导经验的高级管理团队领导。	Internally, CPP Investments is led by a senior management team with a long history of global investment management leadership experience.
	
CPP Investments 制定了严格的风险管理政策和控制措施。它衡量结果以确保它始终符合其使命。两者都有助于做出谨慎、有效的决策。	CPP Investments has strict risk management policies and controls in place. And it measures outcomes to ensure it remains aligned to its mandate. Both contribute to careful, effective decision making.
	
除了法律要求外，CPP Investments 还努力确保 CPP Investments 的业务始终以负责任和有原则的方式开展。其行为准则列出了所有 CPP Investments 员工所要求的道德行为。	In addition to its legal requirements, CPP Investments works hard to ensure that the business of CPP Investments is always conducted responsibly and in a principled manner. Its Code of Conduct lays out the ethical behaviour required of all CPP Investments employees.
