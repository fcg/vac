!2023 年在加拿大从事焊工工作	!Work as a Welder in Canada in 2023
	
加拿大目前正在经历其劳动力市场的巨大变化。移民到加拿大的高技能工人的数量——尤其是科技行业的——逐年增加，这是对信息技术 (IT) 工作所需专业技能的高度重视的结果。	Canada is currently experiencing seismic shifts in its labor market. The number of high-skilled workers- especially in the tech industry- who have been immigrating to Canada has been increasing year on year, a consequence of the high value placed on the specialized skills required to work in information technology (IT).
	
然而，在过去十年左右的时间里，非常重要且处于科技行业另一端的低技能体力劳动工作一直受到劳动力短缺的影响。<./p>	However, low-skilled menial labor jobs, which are highly essential and lie at the opposite end of the spectrum of the tech industry, have continually suffered from labor shortages for the past decade or so.<./p>
	
尤其是贸易工作很难被加拿大当地人才填补，加拿大是世界上受过高等教育的人比例最高的国家之一，导致就读贸易学校的人数直线下降。	Trade jobs in particular have had a difficult time being filled in with local Canadian talent, with Canada having among the highest percentage of tertiary educated individuals in the world, leading to plummeting levels of individuals going to trade schools.
	
人口老龄化也耗尽了现有从业人员的资源，这些从业人员可以通过学习和学徒制将他们的贸易职业技能和知识传授给年轻一代。	The aging population has also depleted the pool of existing practitioners who could be able to transfer their skills and knowledge of their trade occupations to the younger generation via learnerships and apprenticeships.
	
需要这些贸易工作提供的服务的加拿大消费者和企业已求助于加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC)，以帮助他们雇用熟练从事贸易工作的外国工人。	Canadian consumers and businesses that are in need of the services provided by these trade jobs have turned to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) to provide them with the aid to hire foreign workers that are skilled in trade jobs.
	
IRCC 有一份名副其实的移民签证计划和类别清单，可满足潜在移民的需求，这些移民可以为加拿大提供维持其基本服务供应所需的熟练贸易工人。	The IRCC has a veritable list of immigration visa programs and streams that cater to prospective immigrants who can provide Canada with the skilled trade workers it needs to sustain its essential services provision.
	
如果您是一名焊工，这为您提供了利用加拿大劳动力市场的这一技术贸易缺口移民加拿大的绝好机会。	If you’re a welder, this presents the perfect opportunity for you to leverage this skilled trades gap in the Canadian labor market to immigrate to Canada.
	
快速通道系统有联邦经济移民计划，例如联邦技术工人计划、联邦技术贸易计划和加拿大经验类移民计划，省提名计划有大量的紧缺职位清单，其中焊工职位尤为突出。	The Express Entry system has Federal Economic Immigration Programs such as the Federal Skilled Workers program, Federal Skilled Trades program and Canadian Experience Class and Provincial Nominee programs have extensive lists of in-demand jobs in which posts for welders feature prominently.
	
但是，如果您不符合使用快速入境系统或省提名计划申请永久居留权的资格，则可以使用加拿大的工作许可计划。工作许可证允许拥有必要和所需技能的移民在特定时期内移居加拿大工作。	However, if you’re not eligible to apply for permanent residency using either the Express Entry system or Provincial Nominee program, you can use Canada's work permit programs. Work permits allow immigrants who possess the requisite and desired skills to move to Canada for work for a specified period of time.
	
拥有工作许可证允许外国工人进入加拿大工作场所并为他们提供宝贵的经验，他们可以利用加拿大经验类别移民加拿大的机会。	Having a work permit allows foreign workers entry into the Canadian workplace and provides them with valuable experience that they can leverage the opportunity to immigrate to Canada by using the Canadian Experience Class.
	
或者，家庭赞助允许因工作或其他目的移民到加拿大的个人通过赞助计划将他们的家人带到加拿大。为了解决特定地区/省份或行业内的特定劳动力市场需求，IRCC 推出了移民试点计划。	Alternatively, Family sponsorships allow individuals who immigrated to Canada either for work or other purposes to bring their families with them to Canada through sponsorship programs. And to address specific labor market needs within a specific region/province or sector of industry, the IRCC introduced immigration pilot programs.

!作为焊工工作	!Working as a welder
	
焊接主要涉及以不同方式运用和弯曲金属的能力，是世界上最有价值的职业行业之一。金属物质是世界上最常用的结构材料之一，在建筑、艺术、建筑等方面都有应用。	Welding, which predominantly involves the ability to wield and bend metal in different ways, is one of the most valued occupational trades in the world. Metal substances are some of the most commonly utilized structural materials in the world, weather in architecture, art, construction etc.
	
焊工是使使用金属作为基础物质的勤劳的人们获得成功的非常重要的劳动力来源。加拿大的科技和建筑行业蓬勃发展，对具有焊接行业经验的技术工人有着很高的需求。	Welders are a very important source of labor in perpetuating the success of industrious people that use metal as a base substance. Canada, with its booming industries in tech and construction industries has a high demand for skilled workers with experience in the welding industry.
	
因此，认识到它在国际上与其他高知名度的移民目的地国家竞争这个高价值的技术移民工作岗位，它非常重视向加拿大招聘焊工。	Therefore, recognizing that it competes internationally with other high profile immigrant destination countries for this highly valued skilled immigrant pool of jobs, it has placed a premium on recruiting welders to Canada.
	
为此，加拿大工人的平均工资/薪金是世界上最高的。因此，请借此机会探索以下移民加拿大的选择和方式，以便您可以申请并利用这个机会在 2022 年成为加拿大焊工。	To this end, the average wage/salary for workers in Canada is among the highest in the world.

## 2023 年以焊工身份移民加拿大的最佳方式	Best Ways to Immigrate to Canada as a Welder in 2023
	
!最佳移民方式	!Best ways to immigrate
	
以下程序代表了一些申请移民加拿大以在加拿大从事焊工工作的最佳方式。	The following programs represent some of the best ways to apply to immigrate to Canada to work as a welder in Canada.
	
### 快速通道	Express Entry
	
快速入境系统于 2015 年由加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 启动，该部门是加拿大政府的一个部门，负责处理所有加拿大移民，作为使熟练的外国工人及其家人成为加拿大永久居民的一种手段尽快。	The Express Entry system was started in 2015 by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) which is a division of the government of Canada which handles all Canadian immigration as a means of enabling skilled foreign workers and their families to become permanent residents in Canada as quickly as possible.
	
快速入境处理时间可短至六个月，这是 IRCC 实施的一项措施，因为加拿大经济迫切需要加拿大各地众多职业和行业的熟练工人。	Express Entry processing times can be as little as six months, a measure implemented by the IRCC because the Canadian economy desperately needs skilled workers in a multitude of occupations and industries throughout Canada.
	
加拿大政府目前有望实现其年度目标，即到 2023 年底接纳 500,000 名拥有永久居留权的移民。其中很大一部分是通过快速通道系统提交申请的结果。	The Government of Canada is currently on track to meet its annual target of welcoming 500,000 immigrants with a permanent residency by the end of 2023. A significant portion of these was the consequence of applications coming through the Express Entry system.
	
要通过快速通道获得加拿大永久居留权，申请人必须创建快速通道档案。要制作此个人资料，他们需要根据以下人口统计标准进行资格测试：	To gain permanent residency in Canada via Express Entry, applicants must create an Express Entry profile. To make this profile, they need to take an eligibility test based on the following demographic criteria:
	
-   年龄	-   Age
-   教育	-   Education
-   语言能力	-   Language Skills
-   工作经验	-   Work experience
-   婚姻状况	-   Marital Status
- 链接到加拿大	-   Links to Canada
	
根据您对每个资格标准的回答，综合排名系统 (CRS) 将为您生成一个分数。该分数满分 1200，是根据上述因素以及以下因素计算得出的：	Depending on the answers you give for each of these eligibility criteria a score will be generated for you through the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS). This score is out of 1200 and is calculated based on the above factors, as well as:
	
- 技能可转移性	-   Skills Transferability
- 法语语言技能	-   French Language Skills
- 如果他们的任何专上教育是在加拿大	-   If any of their post-secondary education was in Canada
- 如果他们有加拿大的工作机会	-   If they have a Canadian job offer
- 如果他们有省提名	-   If they have a Provincial Nomination
	
当你的分数确定后，你就可以进入快速通道池。每两周进行一次“快速通道”抽签，所有分数高于特定数字的申请人都会收到申请加拿大永久居留权 (ITA) 的邀请。	When your score is determined, you can enter an Express Entry pool. Every two weeks, there is an Express Entry draw where all applicants with a score higher than a certain number are presented with an Invitation to Apply (ITA) for permanent residency in Canada.
	
最低要求随每次抽签而变化，具体取决于感兴趣时快速通道池的大小和强度。	The minimum requirements change with each draw, depending on the size and strength of the Express Entry pool at the time of the interest.
	
你有资格吗？	Do You Qualify?
	
#### 联邦技术贸易计划，CEC	Federal Skilled Trades Program, CEC
	
该计划专门针对拥有公认文凭或经过认证的特定工作培训的技术人员。如果你想申请FSTP，第一步是检查你是否符合联邦政府规定的熟练贸易工人资格。此外，您还需要有有效的工作机会/资格证书才能被视为符合条件。	This program is specifically for skilled trades people with a recognized diploma or certified job-specific training. If you want to apply for FSTP, the first step is to check if you qualify as a skilled trade worker according to the federal government. In addition, you will also need to have a valid job offer/certificate of qualification in order to be considered eligible.
	
从快速入境系统获得申请 ITA 的邀请是您的最终目标，即被考虑在加拿大每个省份（魁北克省除外）永久居留，但获得加拿大省份或地区的省级提名除外。那么您需要在认可您的省/地区定居。	Achieving an Invitation to Apply ITA from the Express Entry system is your ultimate goal to be considered for permanent residence in every province of Canada (apart from Québec) and with the exception of receiving a provincial nomination from a Canadian province or territory. Then you need to settle in the province/territory that endorsed you.
	
#### 加拿大经验类 (CEC)	Canadian Experience Class (CEC)
	
Canadian Experience Class 是专门针对持有学习许可、工作许可或工作假期签证在加拿大至少连续 12 个月生活和工作的技术工人的项目。如果您当时在加拿大并且认为您有资格获得 CEC，请查看此页面以获取完整的细目分类。	Canadian Experience Class is a program specifically for skilled workers living and working in Canada for at least 12 consecutive months via a study permit, work permit or Working Holiday Visa. If you’ve been in Canada for that time and feel you would be eligible for the CEC, look at this page for a full breakdown.
	
#### 省提名项目	Provincial Nominee Programs
	
加拿大的目标是在 2023 年通过省提名计划 (PNP) 接纳多达 86,000 名新移民。加拿大 11 个主要省提名计划下有大约 80 个省提名途径，允许参与的省和地区提名符合条件的经济移民候选人获得加拿大永久居留权.详细了解不同的省提名计划类型，以获得激动人心的加拿大替代路线。	Canada aims to welcome up to 86,000 newcomers through the Provincial Nominee Programs (PNPs) in 2023. There are around 80 provincial nomination pathways under 11 main provincial nominee programs in Canada that allow participating provinces and territories to nominate eligible economic immigration candidates for Canadian permanent residence. Learn more about the different Provincial Nominee Program types for exciting alternative routes to Canada.
	
加拿大政府与各省达成协议，他们可以提名希望在该特定省生活、定居和工作或基本上移民到加拿大的移民。	The Canadian government has an agreement with provinces in which they can nominate immigrants who wish to live, settle, and work in that particular province or essentially, immigrate to Canada.
	
如果您想获得省提名计划 (PNP)，候选人需要选择他们希望居住的省份，然后申请提名。	If you want to receive the Provincial Nominee Programs (PNP), the candidate is required to choose a province they wish to live in and subsequently apply for a nomination.
	
该省将根据其移民和劳工需求考虑申请，同时评估您在该省定居的真实意图。	The province will consider the application based on its immigration and labor needs while assessing your genuine intention to settle in the province.
	
在大多数省份，加拿大移民是促进当地经济和关键部门发展的重要组成部分，同时也支持人口老龄化。	In most provinces, Canadian immigration is an important part of boosting local economies and development in key sectors but also supporting an aging population.
	
如果您决定通过加拿大移民系统下的省提名计划 (PNP) 申请永久居留权，您可以选择两个主要选项：	If you decide to apply for permanent residence through a Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) under the Canadian immigration system, there are two main options you can choose from:
	
- 直接申请省或地区	-   Apply directly to a province or territory
- 快速通道相关流程	-   The Express Entry-linked process
	
直接向您选择的省份申请省提名意味着您必须通过邮寄或快递提交纸质申请。这是一个漫长的过程，可能需要 15 到 19 个月才能确定您的申请是否成功。作为焊工，这种应用方法提供了很高的成功机会，因为许多加拿大省份需要更多焊工的服务。	Applying for a provincial nomination directly to your chosen province means that you will have to submit a paper application via mail or courier. This is a long process and can take from 15 to 19 months to determine whether your application has been successful. As a welder, this application method presents a high opportunity for success since a lot of Canadian provinces require the services of more welders.

### 工作准证	Work Permit
	
如果您作为外国人在加拿大获得工作机会，请把它当作一个您不能拒绝的机会，因为这对您的职业生涯非常有益，并能改善您和您家人的生活质量。	If you get a job offer in Canada as a foreign national, take it as an opportunity that you cannot refuse because it can be a very beneficial move for your career and improve you and your family’s quality of life.
	
工作许可证通常有两种主要类型，其中还有一类工作签证。您必须持有工作许可证和工作签证才能移民加拿大工作。这两个工作许可证包括：	There are generally two main types of work permits, under which there is also a category of work visas. You must be in possession of a work permit and work visa to immigrate to Canada for work purposes. The two work permits include:
	
### 开放工签	Open Work Permit
	
开放式工作许可证不是针对特定工作的选择，这意味着您可以为任何加拿大雇主工作。它使您无需通过劳动力市场影响评估 (LMIA) 即可获得加拿大工作签证。	An open work permit is not a job-specific option, which means that you can work for any Canadian employer. It exempts you from requiring a Labor Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) to qualify for a Canadian work visa.
	
希望在加拿大从事自己喜欢的职业并为自己选择的雇主工作的合格外国公民。	Eligible foreign nationals that want to work in Canada in their preferred occupation and for the employer of their choice.
	
#### 特定雇主工作许可证	Employer-Specific Work Permit
	
该工作许可证允许外国国民为加拿大的特定雇主工作，如工作许可证中详述的条件和限制所述。	This work permit allows foreign nationals to work for a specific employer in Canada, as outlined within the conditions and limitations detailed in the work permit.
	
该工作许可证将外国国民限制在特定地点的一个雇主，有一段雇佣期限，他们被授权为雇主工作并遵守。它需要劳动力市场影响评估 (LMIA)。	This work permit limits a foreign national to one employer at a specific location, with a duration of employment, whom they are authorized to work for and comply with. It requires a Labor Market Impact Assessment (LMIA).
	
该工作许可证适用于希望在特定省份为特定雇主工作并持续特定时间的准移民。	This work permit is for prospective immigrants that want to work for a specific employer in a set province and for a specified duration.

### 试点项目	Pilot Programs
	
!试点项目	!Pilot programs
	
移民试点项目是短期项目，旨在满足加拿大特定地区和社区的需求。这些试点项目针对非熟练、半熟练和熟练的外国人，以解决加拿大各省的劳动力市场需求和短缺问题，焊工在劳动力市场需求中具有高度优先地位。	Immigration pilots are limited-term programs that are designed with the purpose to address the needs of particular areas and communities in Canada. These pilot programs target unskilled, semi-skilled, and skilled foreigners to address the labor market needs and shortages of Canadian provinces, with welders having high priority among labor market needs.
	
移民试点还旨在为那些想在加拿大永久生活和工作的人提供永久居留权的途径。试点计划的一个很好的例子是大西洋移民计划 (AIP)。该试点在缩小工人与退休人员的比例方面做得非常好，为加拿大经济增加了价值；它后来转变为永久性计划。	Immigration pilots are also designed to serve as a pathway to permanent residence for those who want to live and work permanently in Canada. A good example of a pilot program is the Atlantic Immigration Program (AIP). The pilot did exceptionally well bridging the worker-to-retiree ratio, adding value to the Canadian economy; it later transitioned into a permanent program.
	
### 家庭赞助	Family Sponsorships
	
加拿大是一个家庭至上的国家。加拿大理解许多移民不想离开他们的亲人来加拿大，或者，如果他们这样做，也不想在没有家人的情况下留在加拿大，因此，他们制定了尽快返回家园的计划尽可能。	Canada is a nation where family is essential. Canada understands that many immigrants don't want to leave their loved ones behind to come to Canada or, if they do, don't want to stay in Canada without their family and, as a result, make a plan to return home as soon as possible.
	
加拿大热爱移民，因为他们对加拿大文化和经济的发展至关重要，因此作为一名焊工，您可以相信，您与家人一起移民的愿望将得到优先考虑。	Canada loves immigrants because they’re vital for the growth of Canada's culture and economy, so as a welder you can trust that your desire to immigrate with your family will be prioritized.
	
为了促进增长，加拿大政府创建了几个家庭担保移民流，使加拿大公民和永久居民能够担保他们的家庭成员并将他们作为永久居民带到加拿大。	To foster growth, the Canadian government created several family sponsorship immigration streams that enable Canadian citizens and permanent residents to sponsor their family members and bring them to Canada as permanent residents.
	
家庭赞助计划根据加拿大赞助商和被赞助家庭成员之间的关系分为几类。类别包括	Family sponsorship programs are divided into categories based on the relationship between the Canadian sponsor and sponsored family member. The categories include
	
- 配偶/伴侣赞助计划	-   The Spouse/Partner Sponsorship Program
- 父母和祖父母赞助计划	-   The Parent and Grandparent Sponsorship Program
- 受抚养子女资助计划	-   The Dependent Child Sponsorship Program
- 收养赞助计划	-   The Adoption Sponsorship Program
