加拿大移民部门表示，有针对性的快速通道抽签可能会在 2023 年春季开始。	Canada’s immigration department has said that targeted Express Entry draws could start to take place in the spring of 2023.
	
然而，在进行这些抽签之前，加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 必须进行磋商。	Before these draws can take place, however, Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) must engage in consultations.
	
在 1 月 8 日结束的公众咨询电话中，IRCC 称有针对性的抽签是“基于类别的选择”，并表示这将是“整体申请邀请的一部分，基于综合排名系统分数和个别项目的邀请将保留”	In a call for public consultations that ended on January 8, IRCC called targeted draws “category-based selection” and said it will be “a portion of overall invitations to apply, and invitations based on the Comprehensive Ranking System scores and individual programs will remain.”
	
因此，Express Entry 似乎不会像我们所知的那样完全改变。 IRCC 网页建议，所有项目抽签仍将与有针对性和特定项目的抽签一起进行（例如那些只邀请省提名计划 (PNP) 候选人的抽签）。	So, it seems like Express Entry won’t completely change as we know it. The IRCC webpage suggests that all program draws will still happen alongside targeted and program-specific draws (such as those that only invite Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) candidates).
	
虽然咨询文件并非一成不变，但它可以让我们深入了解 IRCC 正在考虑的快速通道的未来。	While the consultation document is not set in stone, it can provide insights into what IRCC is considering for the future of Express Entry.
	
### 选择的优先级和类别	Priorities and categories for selection
	
IRCC 确定了今年将重点关注的优先事项。这些优先事项列在加拿大政府的移民部长授权书中，目前由自由党掌管。	IRCC identified the priorities that it will focus on this year. These priorities are listed in the immigration minister’s mandate letter set out by the government of Canada, currently run by the Liberal Party.
	
2023 年的优先事项包括：	The 2023 priorities include:
	
* 解决劳动力市场长期短缺问题并为未来定位；和	  addressing chronic labour market shortages and positioning for the future; and
* 支持法语少数民族社区的法语移民和经济增长。	  supporting Francophone immigration and economic growth in Francophone minority communities.
	
针对这些项目，IRCC 列出了三个可能的类别，它们可能是未来快速通道抽签的目标：	In response to these items, IRCC named three possible categories that could be the targets of future Express Entry draws:
	
* 根据特定职业或部门的工作经验选择候选人；	  Selecting candidates based on work experience in a particular occupation or sector;
* 将国际学生毕业生过渡到永久居留权；	  Transitioning international student graduates to permanent residence;
* 将临时外国工人转变为永久居留权；和;	  Transitioning temporary foreign workers to permanent residence; and;
* 选择讲法语和双语的候选人（魁北克省以外）。	  Selecting Francophone and bilingual candidates (outside of Quebec).
	
尽管移民部长肖恩·弗雷泽(Sean Fraser)曾公开暗示可以根据地区选择候选人，但咨询文件中并未提及。	Although Immigration Minister Sean Fraser has publicly alluded to the possibility of selecting candidates based on region, it was not mentioned in the consultation document.
	
IRCC 援引加拿大统计局的话说，最严重的劳动力短缺发生在建筑（贸易）、行政和支持服务、废物管理和补救服务、医疗保健和社会援助，以及除公共行政外的其他服务，这些服务被认为是一个独立的行业。这些职位空缺中有许多是符合“快速通道”候选人资格的职业。	Citing Statistics Canada, IRCC said the worst labour shortages are found in construction (trades), administrative and support services, waste management and remediation services, healthcare and social assistance, and other services except for public administration, which is considered a separate industry. Many of these vacancies are in occupations that would qualify candidates for Express Entry.
	
IRCC 表示，除了来自各省、地区和其他利益相关者的反馈外，它将根据劳动力市场信息确定目标抽签的类别。	IRCC says it will determine categories for targeted draws based on labour market information in addition to feedback from provinces, territories, and other stakeholders.
	
“一旦部长决定了类别，就会在我们发出邀请之前宣布，”该网页说，并补充说向议会提交的年度报告将包括类别和选择它们的理由。	“Once categories are decided on by the Minister, they will be announced before we issue invitations,” the webpage says, adding that an annual report to Parliament will include the categories and the rationale for choosing them.
	
IRCC 表示，它将继续报告快速通道移民的结果，通过基于类别的选择吸取的教训将有助于为快速通道系统的未来工作提供信息。	IRCC says it will continue to report on the outcomes of Express Entry immigrants, and lessons learned through category-based selection will help inform future work on the Express Entry system.
	
### Express Entry 见解	Express Entry insights
	
该文件还深入探讨了收到申请邀请 (ITA) 的快速通道候选人。	The document also included a deep dive into the Express Entry candidates who received Invitations to Apply (ITAs).
	
根据 IRCC 的数据，在 2019 年至 2021 年期间，快速通道候选人最常见的主要职业是：	According to IRCC, between 2019 and 2021, the most common primary occupations of Express Entry candidates were:
	
* 食品服务主管	  food service supervisors
* 行政助理	  administrative assistants
* 财务审计师和会计师	  financial auditors and accountants
* 零售销售主管	  retail sales supervisors
* 软件工程师和设计师	  software engineers and designers
* 广告、营销和公共关系方面的专业职业	  professional occupations in advertising, marketing and public relations
* 厨师	  cooks
* 计算机程序员和交互式媒体开发人员	  computer programmers and interactive media developers
* 信息系统分析师和顾问	  information systems analysts and consultants
* 用户支持技术人员	  user support technicians
* 餐厅和食品服务经理	  restaurant and food service managers
* 行政人员	  administrative officers
	
IRCC 指出，由于大流行，从事食品服务主管或行政助理等职业的候选人收到的邀请比例高于往年。 2020 年至 2021 年间，IRCC 主要针对可能已经在加拿大的快速通道候选人。	IRCC noted that candidates working in occupations such as food service supervisors or administrative assistants received a higher proportion of invitations than previous years, due to the pandemic. Between 2020 and 2021, IRCC primarily targeted Express Entry candidates who were likely to already be in Canada.
	
该报告还发现，快速通道候选人受过高等教育。到 2021 年，约有 75% 的人持有至少三年的高等教育证书。	The report also found that Express Entry candidates are highly educated. About 75 percent in 2021 held a post-secondary education credential of at least three years.
	
大多数 ITA 都提供给 20 多岁和 30 多岁的候选人。 2021年，64%的受邀候选人年龄在20-29岁之间，19%的人年龄在30-34岁之间。	Most ITAs are given to candidates in their 20s and 30s. In 2021, 64% of invited candidates were between the ages of 20-29, and 19% were between the ages of 30-34.
	
候选人的官方语言能力也很高。大约 83% 的人至少拥有 7 级加拿大语言基准 (CLB) 或同等法语水平。另有 2,517 人符合法语语言能力加分标准。	Candidates also had high official language proficiency. About 83% had at least a level 7 Canadian Language Benchmark (CLB) or the French equivalent. An additional 2,517 met criteria for additional points for French-language proficiency.
	
### 快速通道是否再次暂停？	Is Express Entry paused again?
	
自 2022 年 11 月 23 日出现故障抽签以来，根本没有进行过快速通道抽签。许多快速通道候选人和移民专业人士报告了一些问题，例如候选人即使符合标准也没有收到 ITA。 11 月 23 日的抽签是自 IRCC 采用 2021 年国家职业分类 (NOC) 以来的第一次快速通道抽签。IRCC 尚未正式表示暂停是由于故障造成的。	There has been no Express Entry draw at all since the glitchy draw of November 23, 2022. A number of Express Entry candidates and immigration professionals reported issues like candidates not receiving ITAs even though they met the criteria. The November 23 draw was the first Express Entry draw since IRCC adopted the National Occupation Classification (NOC) 2021. IRCC has not officially said the pause is due to the glitches.
