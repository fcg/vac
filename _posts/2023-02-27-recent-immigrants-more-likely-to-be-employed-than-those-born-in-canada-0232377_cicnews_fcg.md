# 新移民比在加拿大出生的人更有可能就业 分析移民目标对加拿大经济的影响。	Recent immigrants more likely to be employed than those born in Canada Analyzing the effect of immigration targets on the Canadian economy.
未来三年，加拿大的目标是接纳大约 145 万移民；预计 60% 将通过经济舱课程进行。	Over the next three years, Canada will aim to welcome roughly 1.45 million immigrants; with 60% projected to be through economic class programs.

这波新移民预计将对加拿大经济和社会产生多重积极影响——正如 Desjardins 关于联邦移民目标影响的新研究所揭示的那样，其中一些已经可以看到。	This wave of newcomers is projected to have multiple positive effects for the Canadian economy, and society—some of which can already be seen, as Desjardins’ new study on the impact of federal immigration targets reveals.
	
例如，新移民现在比在加拿大出生的同龄人更有可能找到工作。这是最近出现的现象，归结为两大趋势的汇聚： 2016 年新移民就业率显着上升；以及在加拿大出生的人的就业率逐渐下降。	For instance, new immigrants are now more likely to be employed than their peers born in Canada. This is a recent phenomenon that comes down to the convergence of two major trends: A noted increase in the employment rate of new immigrants starting in 2016; and the gradual decline in employment rate of people born in Canada.
	
这种影响取决于每个群体的人口构成。新移民不成比例地处于核心工作年龄（25-54 岁），并且通常因人力资本因素而被选中，使他们成为加拿大劳动力的理想参与者。另一方面，加拿大人口老龄化，每年都有一批退休人员退出劳动力市场（这是移民首先发生的一个关键原因）。有鉴于此，移民将对经济产生更广泛的影响是相关的。	This effect draws on demographic make-ups of each group. New immigrants are disproportionately of core working age (25-54 years), and are often selected for human capital factors that make them ideal participants in Canada’s labour force. On the other end, Canadians have an aging population, with a consistent group of retirees exiting the workforce every year (a key reason for immigration to occur in the first place). In this light, the wider effects that immigration will have on the economy are pertinent.
	
### 新移民将改变加拿大的人口结构	New immigrants will change the demographic of Canada
	
移民是加拿大人口增长的核心。大多数新移民属于经济型和核心工作年龄。随着未来几年预计会有大量涌入，加拿大的人口估计会变得更加年轻。目前，加拿大人的平均年龄为 41 岁，每年都有退休人员退出劳动力市场。	Immigration is at the heart of population growth for Canada. The bulk of new immigrants are economic and of core-working age. With the huge influx expected in the next coming years, Canada’s population is estimated to grow much younger. Currently the median age of Canadians is 41 years, with retirees exiting the labour force every year.
	
预计核心老年移民的涌入不仅会带来将加拿大人口提高到自我维持水平的社会效益（即：每户至少有两个出生率），还会为加拿大带来一系列经济优势。国家。	It is expected that the influx of core aged immigrants will not just bring the societal benefits of raising Canada’s population up to self-sustaining levels (i.e.: a birthrate of at least two per household)—but also bring a host of economic advantages to the country.
	
###新移民有望提振潜在GDP增长	New immigrants are expected to boost potential GDP growth
	
新移民与劳动力的联系更为紧密。他们中的许多人甚至在进入该国之前就已经有工作，并因人力资本因素而被承认，这些因素使他们能够有效地为劳动力做出贡献。	New immigrants are more tied to the labour force. Many of them have jobs even before entering the country, and admitted for human capital factors that enable them to effectively contribute to the workforce.
	
由于这种移民预计会提高加拿大的人均 GDP（国内生产总值），因为劳动力投入预计会随着移民而增加。 GDP 是一个国家境内生产的所有制成品和服务的总货币价值。 GDP 的增长通常是经济健康的标志，并且可以带来更多的好处，例如增加招聘和工资增长。	As such immigration is predicted to raise Canada’s GDP (Gross Domestic Product) per capita, as labour input is expected to increase with immigration. GDP is the total monetary value of all the finished goods and services produced within a country’s borders. An increase in GDP is generally a sign of a healthy economy, and can lead to further benefits like increases in hiring, and wage growth.
	
预计新移民的到来将进一步帮助提振供给侧经济，并减轻加拿大经济的通胀压力。	The arrival of newcomers is expected to further help bolster the supply side economy, and reduce inflationary pressures on the Canadian economy.
	
### 加拿大能扛得住这波新移民吗？	Can Canada handle this wave of newcomers?
	
Desjardins 研究的一个关键点是移民在劳动力市场上的周期性结果。大约每十年，新移民的失业率就会飙升，然后再次下降（尽管在加拿大 10 年后，移民和加拿大人的失业率基本上没有区别）。	One key note from the Desjardins studies was the cyclical outcomes for immigrants in the labour market. Roughly every ten years sees a spike in newcomer unemployment, before once again diminishing (though after 10 years in Canada the unemployment rates for immigrants and Canadians was largely indistinguishable).
	
新登陆的移民也可能更难在加拿大劳动力市场立足，因为他们开始在加拿大站稳脚跟。这些调查结果引发了人们对加拿大是否准备好迎接未来三年计划迎接的大规模移民潮的质疑。	Newly landed immigrants can also have a harder time gaining initial footing in the Canadian labour market, as they begin to establish themselves in Canada. These findings have raised questions on whether Canada is prepared for the massive wave of immigrants it plans to welcome in the next three years.
	
话虽这么说，但仍有良好迹象表明新移民将获得积极的分娩结果。职位空缺目前创历史新高，是大流行期间的两倍。劳动力市场仍然紧张——这本身就是历史移民目标背后的关键原因之一。除了每年都有老龄化人口退出劳动力市场外，拥有紧缺技能和理想人力资本因素的新移民似乎更有可能在加拿大劳动力市场上取得有利结果。	This being said, there are still good signs that newcomers will have positive labour outcomes. Job vacancies are currently at record highs—and double what they were during the pandemic. The labour market remains tight—itself one of the key reasons behind historic immigration targets. In addition to an aging population exiting the workforce every year, newcomers with in-demand skills and desirable human capital factors seem more likely to have favourable outcomes in the Canadian labour market.
	
### 总之	In summary
	
加拿大的移民目标有望在社会和经济方面对该国产生积极影响。在 COVID-19 大流行之后，加拿大对移民的需求比以往任何时候都大，新移民和加拿大人都有理由对未来三年移民的到来产生积极成果抱有希望。	Canada’s immigration targets are expected to have positive outcomes for the country both societally and economically. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic Canada has greater need for immigrants than ever, and there are reasons for both newcomers and Canadians alike to be hopeful for positive outcomes with the arrival of immigrants in the next three years.
