!如何从牙买加移民到加拿大 u200d加拿大是牙买加人移居国外最受欢迎的目的地之一。它提供稳定的经济、出色的医疗保健、友好的人民和高品质的生活。如果您是考虑移居加拿大的牙买加人，本指南将帮助您了解移民流程和移居加拿大的好处。	!How to Immigrate to Canada from Jamaica ‍Canada is one of the most popular destinations for Jamaicans looking to move abroad. It offers a stable economy, excellent healthcare, friendly people, and a high quality of life. If you're a Jamaican considering a move to Canada, this guide will help you understand the immigration process and the benefits of making a move.
	
快速通道系统	The Express Entry System
	
!快速通道	!Express Entry
	
快速通道系统是牙买加人希望移民加拿大的主要途径。该系统旨在使符合移民标准的技术工人与家人一起移民加拿大，从而简化移民过程。	The Express Entry system is the primary route for Jamaicans looking to immigrate to Canada. This system is designed to make the immigration process easier for skilled workers who meet the criteria for immigration to immigrate to Canada with their families.
	
加拿大政府管理快速通道系统，申请人必须满足语言能力、教育和工作经验的要求才能被考虑。如果您成功了，您有望收到申请永久居留权的邀请。	The Canadian Government manages the Express Entry system, and applicants must meet the requirements for language proficiency, education, and work experience to be considered. If you are successful, you can expect to receive an invitation to apply for permanent residence.
	
快速通道系统有三个专门针对不同申请人的程序。他们是：	The Express Entry System has three programs specifically for different applicants. They are:
	
* 联邦技术工人计划 (FSWP)	  The Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP)
	
* 该项目专门针对从事通常需要学位或文凭的职业的申请人，例如律师、医生或会计师。	  This program is specifically for applicants working in an occupation that usually requires a degree or diploma, such as a lawyer, doctor or accountant.
	
* 联邦技术贸易计划 (FSTP)	  The Federal Skilled Trades Program (FSTP)
	
* 该项目专门针对从事通常需要证书（如文凭）的行业的申请人。该领域的工作示例包括电工、厨师和水管工。	  This program is specifically for applicants working in a trade that usually requires certification, such as a diploma. Examples of jobs in this field are electricians, chefs and plumbers.
	
* 加拿大经验类 (CEC)	  The Canadian Experience Class (CEC)
	
* 该计划专门针对那些已经在加拿大从事技术职业生活和工作至少一年的人。	  This program is specifically for those who have already been living and working in Canada in a skilled profession for at least a year.
	
申请人通过在加拿大政府网站上创建“快速通道”个人资料来申请。在此个人资料中，他们输入个人详细信息，如年龄、婚姻状况、工作经验、教育水平和与加拿大的联系。然后，加拿大政府将使用综合排名系统 (CRS) 评估这些细节以产生 CRS 分数。然后将这些分数输入 Express Entry Pool。	Applicants apply by creating an Express Entry profile on the Canadian government website. In this profile, they enter personal details like age, marital status, work experience, level of education and connections to Canada. The Canadian Government will then evaluate these details using the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS)to produce a CRS score. These scores are then entered into an Express Entry Pool.
	
加拿大政府每两周举办一次“快速通道”抽签，其中得分最高的申请人，通常是从事加拿大需求量最大的职业的申请人，将收到申请加拿大永久居留权的邀请 (ITA)。他们有 60 天的时间来获取所有必要的文件来备份他们提交的信息。	Every two weeks, the Canadian Government hosts an Express Entry draw, wherein the highest scoring applicants, often those who work in Canada's most in-demand occupations, are presented with an Invitation To Apply (ITA) for permanent residency in Canada. They have 60 days to acquire all necessary documentation to back up their submitted information.

省提名计划	Provincial Nominee Programs
	
!省提名计划	!Provincial Nominee Programs
	
省提名计划 (PNP) 由加拿大 13 个省中的 11 个制定，旨在促进技能符合每个省劳动力市场需求的熟练外国工人的移民。	The Provincial Nominee Programs (PNPs) are devised by 11 of Canada's 13 provinces to facilitate the immigration of skilled foreign workers whose skills match the needs of each province's labour market.
	
每个省份都有自己的选择要求和标准。如果您符合特定省份的标准，您可以申请省提名证书。	Each province has its requirements and standards for selection. If you meet the criteria for a particular province, you can apply for a Provincial Nomination Certificate.
	
申请 PNP 有两种方式。第一种、最快和最受欢迎的方法是将其作为快速通道应用程序的一部分。创建“快速通道”个人资料时，您可以向特定省份提交意向书 (EOI)。如果您的申请成功，省提名将为您的 CRS 分数增加 600 分，并加快您获得加拿大永久居留权的道路。	There are two ways to apply for a PNP. The first, fastest, and most popular way is to do it as part of an Express Entry application. When you create your Express Entry profile, you can submit an Expression of Interest (EOI) to a specific province. If your application is successful, a Provincial Nomination will add 600 points to your CRS score and fast-track your path to permanent residency in Canada.
	
PNP 的替代途径是直接向该省申请。每个省份都有其申请流程和处理时间。	The alternative route to a PNP is to apply directly to the province. Each province has its application process and processing times.
	
最大限度地提高获得 PNP 机会的最佳方法之一是从事所选省份的热门职业之一。你可以在这张地图上选择一个省份，看看目前有哪些职业需求旺盛。	One of the best ways to maximize your chances of getting a PNP is to work in one of the in-demand occupations of your chosen province. You can select a province on this map and see which occupations are currently in demand.
	
	  
	
家庭赞助计划	Family Sponsorship Programs
	
家庭赞助计划旨在帮助希望一起生活在加拿大的家庭成员。例如，如果您的直系亲属已经是加拿大公民或永久居民，他们可以担保您移民加拿大。	The Family Sponsorship Programs are designed to help family members who want to live in Canada together. For example, if you have an immediate family member who is already a Canadian citizen or permanent resident, they can sponsor you to immigrate to Canada.
	
家庭成员必须满足某些要求才有资格成为担保人。您的担保人必须：	The family member must meet certain requirements to be eligible as a sponsor. Your sponsor must:
	
* 至少年满 18 岁。	  Be at least 18 years old.
* 是加拿大公民或永久居民。	  Be a Canadian citizen or permanent resident.
* 能够在您抵达加拿大时为您提供资金。	  Be able to fund you upon your arrival in Canada.
	
共有三个主要的家庭赞助计划，每个都代表您与赞助商的关系。它们如下：	There are three major Family Sponsorship Programs, each representing your relationships with your sponsor. They are as follows:
	
### 配偶和家庭担保	Spousal and Family Sponsorship
	
该计划专门针对直系亲属。如果你的配偶住在加拿大，他们可以担保你的永久居留权，或者如果你住在加拿大，你可以担保你的配偶或孩子。	This program is specifically for immediate family members. If your spouse lives in Canada, they can sponsor your permanent residency, or if you live in Canada, you can sponsor your spouse or children.

An RCIC can give you a complete evaluation and help you find the perfect pathway. Not only that, but they will fill out your forms, set up your Express Entry profile, help you verify and source your documents, curate your CV to Canadian standards and provide you with all of the support and guidance you need.
