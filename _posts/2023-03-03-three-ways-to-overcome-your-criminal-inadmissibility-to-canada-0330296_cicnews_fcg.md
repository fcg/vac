# 克服刑事不可入境加拿大的三种方法 应对刑事不可入境可能很复杂，因此这里有一些策略可以帮助您在前往加拿大的旅程中克服这一障碍。	Three ways to overcome your criminal inadmissibility to Canada Navigating criminal inadmissibility can be complex, so here are some strategies for overcoming this hurdle on your journey to Canada.
刑事不可入境可能是外国公民进入加拿大的主要障碍之一。	Criminal inadmissibility can be one of the leading barriers to entry for foreign nationals looking to enter Canada.
	
从酒后驾车 (DWI) 到欺诈和一级谋杀等违法行为和定罪可能是准加拿大新移民被禁止入境的原因。	Offences and convictions ranging from driving while intoxicated (DWI) to fraud and first-degree murder can be reasons that prospective newcomers to Canada may be barred from entering the country.
	
但是，加拿大政府确实为您提供了几种途径，如果您被认为在加拿大犯有刑事罪，则可以克服这种身份并进入该国。	However, the Government of Canada does provide several pathways for you, if deemed criminally inadmissible to Canada, to overcome this status and come into the country.
	
### 个体康复	Individual Rehabilitation
	
您可以探索的第一个途径来克服加拿大的刑事不可入境性是个人康复。对于犯罪不可接受的新移民来说，这是一个永久性的解决方案，只要您不犯下其他罪行即可。	The first pathway you can explore to overcome criminal inadmissibility to Canada is individual rehabilitation. This is a permanent solution for criminally inadmissible newcomers, so long as you do not commit another crime.
	
要被归类为“改过自新”，您必须满足几个标准，这些标准对于导致您不可入境的犯罪性质而言是独一无二的。此外，在政府眼中，您必须被视为“极不可能参与进一步的”犯罪活动。	To be classified as “rehabilitated”, you must meet several criteria, which are unique to the nature of the offence that led to your inadmissibility. Additionally, you must be seen—in the eyes of the government—as “highly unlikely to take part in further” criminal activity.
	
此外，“个人改过自新”称号的另一个要求是，从您犯下有关罪行之日起至您的刑事判决（包括缓刑）结束已满五年。	Furthermore, another requirement of the “individual rehabilitation” designation is that five years have passed since the day you committed the offence in question and since the end of your criminal sentence (including probation).
	
最后，加拿大政府指出，刑事康复申请“可能需要一年多的时间来处理”，因此 IRCC 建议您确保在前往加拿大之前做好充分的计划。	Finally, the Canadian government notes that criminal rehabilitation applications “can take over a year to process,” so IRCC recommends you ensure that you are planning far enough in advance of your travel to Canada.
	
### 记录停学或出院	Record Suspension or Discharge
	
如果您申请并获得加拿大假释委员会的批准，则记录暂停或释放也可以使您获得加拿大的接纳。以前简称为“赦免”，在加拿大授予的记录暂停/释放将解除您的刑事不可入境性并简化您进入该国的途径。	A record suspension or discharge can also work to make you admissible to Canada if you apply for, and are granted one, by the Parole Board of Canada. Formerly known simply as a “pardon”, record suspensions/discharges granted in Canada will dissolve your criminal inadmissibility and simplify your path toward entry into the country.
	
相反，在其他国家/地区授予的记录暂停和解除将要求您首先向为您所在国家或地区提供服务的加拿大签证处核实，以确认其在加拿大的有效性。	Conversely, record suspensions and discharges granted in other countries will require that you first check with the Canadian Visa Office serving your home country or region to confirm its validity in Canada.
	
然而，重要的是要注意，任何特定罪行的记录暂停或解雇并不一定会导致立即被加拿大接纳。边境服务官员仍然有资源和义务确定您不是因为其他原因不能进入该国。	It is vital to note, however, that a record suspension or discharge for any specific offence does and will not necessarily result in immediate admissibility to Canada. Border services officers will still have the resources and obligation to determine that you are not inadmissible to the country for other reasons.
	
### 临时居留许可	Temporary Resident Permit
	
如果您在边境遇到的官员确定有正当理由留在加拿大，即使您的刑期结束后不到五年，您也可以进入该国。换句话说，与上文所述的刑事康复申请不同，临时居留许可 (TRP) 不需要经过一定的时间，因为您犯下了导致您被视为不可进入加拿大的罪行。	With a valid reason to be in Canada, as determined by the officer you encounter at the border, you can become admissible into the country even if it has been less than five years since the end of your criminal sentence. In other words, unlike a criminal rehabilitation application as outlined above, Temporary Resident Permits (TRPs) do not require a certain length of time to have passed since you committed the offence that caused you to be deemed inadmissible to Canada.
	
但是，临时居民许可证是有时间限制的，许可证的期限将取决于您来加拿大的原因。 TRP 通常也仅在您在该国逗留期间有效，这与一些永久性解决方案（如刑事康复申请）相反。	However, Temporary Resident Permits are time-constrained, and the length of a given permit will be determined by your reason for coming to Canada. TRPs are also typically only valid for the duration of your stay in the country, contrary to some permanent solutions like a criminal rehabilitation application.
	
TRP 协助移民或边境服务官员确定您是否可以进入加拿大。该官员将酌情决定他们是否认为您进入或留在加拿大的必要性“超过了对加拿大社会的健康或安全风险”，并且您的入境许可将从那里决定。	TRPs assist an immigration or border services officer with determining your admissibility to Canada. The officer will use their discretion to determine whether they believe your need to enter or stay in Canada “outweighs the health or safety risks to Canadian society” and your admissibility into the country will be decided from there.
