现在正是开始回收利用，为子孙后代改善环境的最佳时机。回收可以减少污染和垃圾填埋场废物，并有助于保护我们的自然资源、生态系统和野生动物。这里有一些回收技巧。	There is no time like today to start recycling, to help improve the environment for future generations. Recycling can reduce pollution and landfill waste, and help with protecting our natural resources, ecosystem and wildlife. Here are some recycling tips.
	
**了解 3R——回收、减少、再利用**	**Learn about the 3Rs – Recycle, Reduce, Reuse**
	
教导孩子减少浪费的重要性。让您的孩子参与进来，让他们长大后具有环保意识。通过周密的计划和组织，家庭中的每个人都可以在回收方面发挥重要作用。在您的家中指定一个带有清晰标签和容器的回收区。根据孩子的年龄，分配给他们不同的回收任务，例如将可回收物分类或将可回收物放到路边。	Teach children the importance of reducing waste. Get your children involved so that they will grow up to be environmentally conscious. With careful planning and organizing, everyone in family can play an important role in recycling. Designate a recycling area with clear labels and containers at your home. Based on the age of children, assign them different recycling tasks, such as sorting the recyclables or putting the recyclables to the curb.
	
**遵守您所在城市的规定**	**Abide by your city’s regulations**
	
了解您所在城市和房屋的回收和垃圾处理规章制度。不遵守章程可能会导致罚款。查看您当地的回收和废物管理网站和应用程序，它们可以为居民提供时间表、服务提醒和提醒。一些网站甚至有供幼儿学习回收利用的应用程序和程序。	Know your city and housing recycling and garbage disposal bylaws. Failure to abide by bylaws may result in fines. Check out your local recycling and waste management websites and apps that can provide residents with the schedule, service alerts and reminders. Some websites even have apps and programs for young children to learn about recycling.
	
**爱护环境**	**Care for the environment**
	
考虑在您的后院放一个堆肥桶和雨水桶，以帮助您进行园艺。捐赠健康的植物，并与他人一起从您的花园中收获。在大自然中时，教您的孩子将垃圾放入指定的垃圾箱或回收箱。如果没有地方可以丢弃垃圾或可回收材料，请随身携带，稍后再处理，避免在大自然中乱扔垃圾。	Consider putting a composter and rain barrel in your backyard to help with your gardening. Donate healthy plants and harvest from your garden with others. When out in nature, teach your children to put garbage in the designated garbage or recycle bins. If there is no place to discard garbage or recyclable materials, take them with you to dispose later, to avoid littering in nature.
	
**给物品第二次生命**	**Give items a second life**
	
考虑将可用的家居用品出售或捐赠给当地的寄售商店、旧货店，或送给朋友和家人。找到修复或重复使用物品的方法，例如升级回收和重新利用物品或重复使用物品进行工艺项目或向当地学校和慈善机构捐赠额外的工艺品和用品。查看可以在线赠送或出售物品的网站。	Consider selling or donating usable household materials to local consignment stores, thrift stores or give them to friends and families. Find ways to fix or reuse items, such as upcycling and repurposing things or reusing items for craft projects or donating extra craft and supplies to local schools and charities. Check websites where you can give away or sell items online.
	
**减少一次性用品**	**Cut down on disposables**
	
购物时，有意识地决定购买使用回收材料和/或更少包装制成的产品。为了减少您的碳足迹，请额外努力购买本地产品并减少购买。使用可重复使用的容器代替一次性袋子或果汁瓶作为儿童午餐。购物时带上自己的可重复使用的购物袋，外卖时带上自己的容器。	When shopping, make conscious decisions to buy products made with recycled materials, and/or less packaging. To reduce your carbon footprint, make an extra effort to buy local and buy less. Use reusable containers instead of use disposable bags or juice bottles for children’s lunch. Bring your own reusable shopping bags when shopping and your own containers for food takeout.
	
家庭回收确实需要额外的时间和精力才能开始，但其影响和好处是值得付出努力的。致力于让回收成为您家庭日常活动的一部分，并教导您的孩子为子孙后代打造一个更绿色、更美好的地球。	Recycling as a family does require extra time and effort to start, but the impact and benefits are well worth the effort. Commit to making recycling part of your family routine, and teach your children to make the planet a greener and better place for future generations to come.
