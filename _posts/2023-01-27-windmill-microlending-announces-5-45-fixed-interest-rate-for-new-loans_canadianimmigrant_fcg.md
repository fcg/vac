作为加拿大的新移民，获得成功的最佳途径之一就是掌握财务状况并规划未来。鉴于我们在进入 2023 年时面临严峻的经济环境，这并不容易。	As a newcomer to Canada, one of the best ways to achieve success is to get a grasp of the financial landscape and plan for the future. And this is not easy given the tough economic climate we face as we enter 2023.
	
通货膨胀水平上升、利率上升和生活成本增加都给许多技术移民和难民带来了忧虑和焦虑。当您在加拿大开始新生活时，高利率的影响——发展您的事业、寻找住房和发展您的家庭，可能会非常令人沮丧。	Rising inflation levels, a hike in interest rates and an increased cost of living have all created apprehension and anxiety for many skilled immigrants and refugees.  The impact of higher interest rates just as you are establishing a new life in Canada — building your career, finding housing, and growing your family, can be very frustrating.
	
为了应对这些不确定的时期，为技术移民和难民提供负担得起的贷款的加拿大慈善机构 Windmill Microlending 宣布，所有新贷款在整个贷款期限内的固定利率上限为 5.95%。将这笔贷款限制在前所未有的低于最优惠利率的固定利率是为了确保新移民可以获得和负担得起贷款。	In response to these uncertain times, Windmill Microlending, a Canadian charity offering affordable loans to skilled immigrants and refugees, has announced that all new loans will be capped at a fixed interest rate of 5.95 per cent for the entire loan duration. Capping this loan at this unprecedented below-prime rate, fixed interest rate is to ensure that the loans are accessible and affordable for newcomers.
	
通过在贷款期间设定固定利率，该组织力求确保付款稳定性，让新移民在管理财务时更加安心。小额贷款帮助支付认证、培训和职业发展的费用。此外，目标是为客户提供机会并建立他们的信心，以确保获得与其技能和经验相符的职位。	By setting a fixed interest rate over the loan period, the organization seeks to ensure payment stability, providing newcomers with greater peace of mind when managing finances. The microloans help pay for the costs of  accreditation, training and career development.  In addition, the goal is to provide clients with the opportunity and build their confidence to secure roles that align with their skills and experience.
	
该组织希望这项临时措施能够减轻技术移民和难民在充分发挥潜力时的经济困难，同时有助于缓解加拿大的劳动力短缺问题。	The organization hopes that this temporary measure will alleviate financial suffering for skilled immigrants and refugees as they utilize their full potential, in addition to contributing towards easing Canada’s labour shortage.
