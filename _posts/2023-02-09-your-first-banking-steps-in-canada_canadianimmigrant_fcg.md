加拿大的银行业务可能与您所在国家/地区的略有不同。因此，了解新国家的金融体系是您作为新移民要采取的众多第一步之一。通过一些信息和准备，您可以对自己的财务之旅充满信心。	Banking may be a little different in Canada than in your home country. So, understanding the financial system in your new country is one of the many first steps you will take as a newcomer. With a little information and preparation, you can feel confident in your financial journey.
	
如果您正处于这条道路的起点，这里有四个步骤可以指导您一路走来。	If you are at the starting point on this path, here are four steps to guide you along the way.
	
#### **步骤#1：做你的研究**	**Step #1: Do your research**
	
新移民 Bimal S. Kumar 是一名技术专家，四年前定居在安大略省的基奇纳，他对处理自己的财务有很多疑问。 “开设银行账户的过程非常简单，所有机构的产品也相对简单，”库马尔说。 “但在开设账户后，我有很多问题无法得到答案。加拿大银行经常缺少金融教育，所以我做了很多自学。”	Newcomer Bimal S. Kumar, a tech professional who settled in Kitchener, Ontario, four years ago, had many questions about dealing with his finances. “The process of opening a bank account is quite straightforward and the offerings of all institutions are relatively straightforward, too,” Kumar says. “But after opening my account, I had a lot of questions that I was not able to get answers to. Financial education is often missing in Canadian banks, so I did a lot of self-learning.”
	
如果你有像 Kumar 这样的问题，那么在走进金融机构之前做一些研究是重要的第一步。从一些初步的在线研究开始，包括在您所在地区的不同金融机构的网站上。比较不同银行或信用合作社必须提供的服务，从账户类型到利率和其他特别优惠。	If you have questions like Kumar, doing some research before you walk into a financial institution is an important first step. Start with some initial research online, including on the websites of the different financial institutions in your area. Compare what different banks or credit unions have to offer, from types of accounts, to interest rates and other special offers.
	
如今，许多金融机构都有新移民援助计划和优惠，旨在吸引您的业务。这些可能包括在其机构开立账户或申请信用卡的特别回扣、奖励和津贴。	These days, many financial institutions have newcomer assistance programs and offers designed to attract your business. These could include special rebates, incentives and perks for opening an account or applying for a credit card at their institution.
	
#### **第 2 步：考虑您需要哪些帐户**	**Step #2: Consider what accounts you need**
	
这项研究的一部分还包括花时间了解您自己的银行业务需求和优先事项。因此，在您财务途径的第二步中，请考虑您想要的银行账户类型和数量。	Part of this research is also taking the time to understand your own banking needs and priorities. So, in this second step along your financial pathway, consider what type and how many bank accounts you want.
	
支票账户和储蓄账户是加拿大最常见的两种个人银行账户类型。支票账户最适合日常银行交易，例如接收工资存款、支付账单、购物、存款和取款以及进行在线交易。它们是为了方便而设计的，但通常不会产生太多兴趣。	Chequing and savings accounts are the two most common types of personal bank accounts in Canada. A chequing account is best for everyday banking transactions, like receiving payroll deposits, paying bills, making purchases, depositing and withdrawing money, and performing online transactions. They are designed for convenience, but don’t usually earn much interest.
	
储蓄账户用于存储您希望安全持有更长时间并获得更好利率的资金。这是一个从每个薪水支票中存钱的好地方，可以为大额采购、教育投资、职业发展或紧急情况进行投资。	A savings account is for storing money you would like to hold securely for longer and earn a better interest rate. It’s a good place to put money aside from each paycheque to save for larger purchases, investing in your education, professional development or for an emergency.
	
如果您已婚或有另一半，您可能还需要考虑是否需要任何联名账户来分摊账单。	If you’re married or have a significant other, you may also want to consider if you want any joint accounts for shared bills.
	
在您与您选择的银行或信用合作社预约后，您的顾问可以为您提供更多详细信息，说明他们的账户在费用、利率和其他功能方面必须提供的服务。不要害怕在不同的金融机构之间货比三家，看看谁提供最好的利率和最低的费用！	After you make an appointment with the bank or credit union of your choice, your advisor can give you more details on what their accounts have to offer in terms of fees, interest rates and other features. Don’t be afraid to shop around between different financial institutions to see who has the best interest rate offerings and lowest fees!
	
#### **步骤#3：下一步，考虑信用**	**Step #3: Next step, consider credit**
	
在选择您在加拿大的第一家银行时，请考虑他们提供的除账户基础之外的其他服务。虽然您可能还没有准备好考虑信用卡、投资和贷款等问题，但您至少应该问问您选择的银行必须提供什么服务。	When selecting your first bank in Canada, consider what else they offer beyond the account basics. While you may not be ready to think of things like credit cards, investments and loans, you should at least ask what your chosen bank has to offer.
	
就在不久前，加拿大的新移民还在为获得信用卡和抵押贷款的批准而苦苦挣扎。今天，随着移民人数的增加，银行正在进行营销以吸引新移民。因此，即使您不需要立即申请信用卡或贷款，也要比较不同银行提供的服务，尤其是信用卡限额和利率。	It wasn’t that long ago that newcomers in Canada struggled with getting approved for credit cards and mortgages. Today, with immigration numbers as high as they are, banks are marketing to attract newcomers. So, even if you don’t need a credit card or a loan right away, compare what different banks are offering particularly around credit card limits and interest rates.
	
如果您在加拿大没有信用记录，仍然很难从传统银行或金融机构获得贷款。考虑替代方案，例如专门针对移民和难民的小额贷款组织，例如 Windmill Microlending。这家加拿大慈善机构向新移民提供总额高达 15,000 美元的小额贷款，这些贷款可用于支付认证、培训或职业发展课程的费用。	If you don’t have a credit history in Canada, it can still be difficult to get a loan from a traditional bank or financial institution. Consider alternatives like microlending organizations that focus exclusively on immigrants and refugees such as Windmill Microlending. This Canadian charity offers microloans to newcomers totalling up to $15,000 and these can be used to pay for the costs of accreditation, training or career development courses.

#### **第 4 步：了解您的权利**	**Step #4: Know your rights**
	
最后，一旦您选择了一家银行并开设了账户，您就知道您正在与该银行签订协议，因此您拥有某些权利。这些权利旨在保护您的利益并确保您不受任何虚假或误导性信息的影响。银行还必须获得您对任何电子通讯的同意，并以清晰、透明和简单的方式与您沟通，尤其是关于引入任何新收费或费用的信息。	Finally, once you select a bank and open your accounts, know that you are entering into an agreement with the bank and hence have certain rights. These rights are aimed at protecting your interests and ensuring that you are not subject to any false or misleading information. The bank must also receive your consent for any electronic communication and communicate with you in a clear, transparent and simple manner, especially about the introduction of any new charges or fees.
	
#### **底线**	**The bottom line**
	
这四个步骤将帮助您顺利开启通往繁荣的财务之路。还有更多问题吗？接触您正在追随其脚步的其他新人。	These four steps will help you start your financial pathway to prosperity on the right foot. Have more questions? Reach out to other newcomers whose footsteps you’re following.
	
“与经历过这段旅程的其他新移民就财务问题进行对话总是一个好主意，”库马尔建议道。 “我觉得作为新来者，我们谈论其他一切——购物、食物、生活方式——但我们不谈论财务。与他人交谈、与财务顾问交谈以及参加研讨会和讲习班是增强您的财务知识的一些方法。”	“It is always a good idea to have a conversation about finances with other newcomers who have been through this journey,” advises Kumar. “I feel that as newcomers we talk about everything else — shopping, food, lifestyle — but we don’t talk about finances. Talking to others, speaking with a financial advisor, and attending seminars and workshops are some ways to enhance your financial knowledge.”
