由加拿大政府管理的加拿大国际体验 (IEC) 计划为来自 36 个伙伴国家的年轻人提供了在加拿大工作和旅行的机会。该计划于 2003 年启动，旨在促进参与国青年的国际视野和工作经验。该计划正在接受其 2023 年池的申请，并增加了其计划的容量，希望能迎接数万名来自国外的青年。申请池的开放是在去年宣布 IEC 将扩大其计划接收人数之后，允许来自伙伴国家的近 90,000 名申请人有机会在 2023 年在加拿大工作和旅行。	The International Experience Canada (IEC) program, managed by the government of Canada, is an opportunity for youth from 36 partner countries to work and travel in Canada. The program was launched in 2003 as a means to promote international exposure and work experience to the youth of participating nations. The program is accepting applications for its 2023 pool, and has increased the capacity of its program, hoping to welcome tens of thousands of youth from abroad. The opening of the application pool comes following last year’s announcement, that the IEC would be expanding its program intake, allowing close to 90,000 applicants from partner countries the opportunity to work and travel in Canada, in 2023.
	
扩大 IEC 计划容量之际，加拿大正希望迎来比以往更多的新移民，预计未来三年内将有超过 80 万名经济移民来到加拿大。通过 IEC 在加拿大获得必要工作经验的青年可能会发现自己将来更有资格移民加拿大。加拿大移民难民和公民部 (IRCC) 希望该计划的扩展将进一步帮助满足在大流行期间遭受损失的部门的劳动力需求，尤其是在旅游业。	The expansion of the IEC program capacity comes at a time when Canada is hoping to welcome more newcomers than ever, with over 800,000 economic immigrants expected to come to the country within the next three years. Youth who gain the requisite amount of work experience in Canada through the IEC may find themselves further eligible for immigration to Canada in the future. Immigration Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) hopes that the expansion of the program will further help fulfil labor needs in sectors that suffered during the pandemic, most notably in tourism.
	
**IEC 计划如何运作？**	**How does the IEC program work?**
	
该计划采用“表达兴趣/申请邀请”模式，感兴趣的候选人可以向 IEC 池提交候选人资料。如果被选中，这些候选人（现在是申请人）将收到申请加拿大工作许可的邀请。如果申请获得批准，申请人将获得其特定类别下的工作许可，并有资格在其授权逗留期间进入加拿大并在加拿大工作。这使得申请人能够在该国获得宝贵的工作经验，对于大多数国家来说最多可达 24 个月。	The program works on an “expression of interest / invitation to apply” model, where interested candidates can submit a candidacy profile to the IEC pool. If chosen, these candidates (now applicants), receive invitations to apply for a Canadian work permit. If the application is approved, the applicant receives their work permit under their specific stream and become eligible to enter and work in Canada for the period of their authorized stay. This allows applicants to gain valuable work experience in the country, up to 24 months for most countries.
