什么是生物识别技术，为什么我需要提交它们？ IRCC 收集了许多加拿大移民申请人的指纹和照片（生物识别）。找出为什么这是这个国家移民的重要组成部分。	What are biometrics and why do I need to submit them? IRCC collects the fingerprints and photographs (biometrics) of many Canadian immigration applicants. Find out why this is a crucial component to immigration in this country.
	
生物特征是一个人独特的身体特征，可以用来识别他们。	Biometrics are the unique physical characteristics of a person that can be used to identify them.
	
在加拿大移民的背景下，生物识别技术指的是指纹和照片，这可能是加拿大某些移民途径的一部分（但稍后会详细介绍）。	In the context of Canadian immigration, biometrics refers to fingerprints and a photograph, which may be a required submission as part of some immigration pathways to Canada (but more on that later).
	
通常情况下，加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 将要求对任何访客签证、学习许可、工作许可或永久居留申请进行生物识别。	Typically, biometrics will be required by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) for any visitor visa, study permit, work permit, or permanent residence application.
	
提交生物识别信息的过程如下。	The process involved with submitting your biometrics is as follows.
	
首先，重要的是，需要在申请中提交生物识别信息的个人在提交申请时支付生物识别费用，以避免潜在的处理延迟。	First, it is important that individuals required to submit biometrics with their application pay their biometrics fee at the time of application submission to avoid potential processing delays.
	
在提交移民申请并支付生物识别费用后，需要提供生物识别信息的人将收到政府的确认信，其中包括去哪里提交指纹和照片的信息。	After submitting an immigration application and paying the biometrics fee, those required to provide biometrics will receive a confirmation letter from the government that includes information on where to go to submit their fingerprints and photograph.
	
个人必须将这封信和有效护照带到离他们最近的生物识别采集点（仅限预约），并在提交时提供这两件。	Individuals must take this letter and a valid passport to their closest biometrics collection site (by appointment only) and provide both pieces at the time of submission.
	
提交指纹和照片似乎是一种证明个人身份的乏味方式，但生物识别技术成为加拿大移民程序的关键要素有几个关键原因。	Submitting fingerprints and a photograph may seem like a tedious way to prove one’s identity, but there are several key reasons why biometrics are a crucial element of the Canadian immigration process.
	
### 为什么生物识别很重要？	Why are biometrics important?
	
生物识别技术对于确认一个人的身份至关重要。虽然这现在看起来可能不是一项重要措施，但加拿大政府建议生物识别技术可以通过多种方式帮助加拿大移民保持安全。	Biometrics are vital to being able to confirm one’s identity. Although this may not seem like an important measure now, the Canadian government advises that biometrics help Canadian immigrants stay safe in several ways.
	
例如，将生物识别技术存档会使人们更难通过伪造、窃取或使用您的身份来盗用身份。	For instance, having biometrics on file makes it harder for people to commit identity theft by forging, stealing, or using your identity.
	
此外，如果一个人的姓名、出生日期和/或出生地与其他人的姓名、出生日期和/或出生地相似，生物识别技术可以更轻松地解决可能发生的问题或错误。	Additionally, biometrics make it easier to resolve problems or errors that may happen if a person’s name, birthdate and/or place of birth are like those of someone else.
	
### 最后，从移民的角度来看，如果个人需要申请另一个项目或在离开后重新进入加拿大，生物识别技术有助于快速确认该人的身份。	Finally, from an immigration perspective, should an individual ever need to apply for another program or re-enter Canada after departure, biometrics helps with quickly confirming that person’s identity.
	
### 哪些项目要求考生提交生物识别信息？	Which programs require candidates to submit their biometrics?
	
现在生物识别的重要性已经很清楚了，让我们回到之前的对话，围绕哪些加拿大移民项目需要生物识别提交，哪些项目不需要。	Now that the importance of biometrics is clear, let us return to an earlier conversation surrounding what Canadian immigration programs require a biometrics submission and which programs do not require it.
	
您是否需要提交指纹和照片取决于您申请移民的国家、您申请的签证类型或身份，以及各种其他因素，包括您之前是否提交过生物识别信息.	Whether or not you will be required to submit your fingerprints and a photograph will depend on the country you are applying for immigration from, the type of visa or status you are applying for, and a variety of other factors including whether you have previously submitted biometrics.
	
加拿大政府提供了一种生物识别工具，希望加拿大移民的人可以通过回答几个简单的问题来了解他们是否需要在申请时提交生物识别信息。	The Government of Canada provides a biometrics tool that allows Canadian immigration hopefuls to find out if they need to submit biometrics along with their application by answering a few simple questions.
	
### 我可以在哪里提交我的生物识别信息？	Where can I submit my biometrics?
	
在您确定是否需要提交生物识别信息并在提交移民申请的同时支付生物识别费用后，加拿大政府将向您发送一封确认信，其中包含有关去哪里提交生物识别信息的信息。	After you find out if you need to submit your biometrics and pay your biometrics fee alongside your submitted immigration application, the Canadian government will send you a confirmation letter that includes information on where to go to submit your biometrics.
	
政府还提供了生物特征收集站点的在线列表，以便根据个人的国家和城市轻松找到最近的提交位置。	The government also provides an online list of biometrics collection sites to make it easy to locate the closest submission location based on an individual’s country and city.
