!如何在 2023 年从阿联酋移民到加拿大	!How to Immigrate From the UAE to Canada in 2023
	
多年来，加拿大作为主要移民目的地获得了非常好的印象。它通过在有助于一般生活满意度的方面（如教育、医疗保健、就业和住房）的持续高排名而赢得了这一声誉。	Canada has gained a very favorable impression over the years as a prime immigration destination. It has gained this reputation through its persistent high rankings in aspects that contribute to general life satisfaction such as education, healthcare, employment and housing.
	
与上述事实不同的是，来自各行各业和世界各地的移民已经注意到加拿大作为一个可以寻求更好生活的地方的突出地位。	In lieu of the aforementioned fact, immigrants from all walks of life and all over the world have taken note of Canada’s prominence as a place where you can go to seek a better life.
	
在这些越来越多的不同国民中，有越来越多的阿联酋人，他们通过最近本国经济的蓬勃发展利用这个机会在加拿大寻求更好的生活。	Among these growing throngs of varied nationals is a growing number of Emirati's, who through the recently thriving success of their country’s economy have taken advantage of the opportunity to seek a better life in Canada.
	
以下提供了有关 2023 年从阿联酋移民到加拿大的一些最佳方式的综合指南。	The following provides a comprehensive guide on some of the best ways to immigrate to Canada from the UAE in 2023.
	
## 如何从阿联酋移民到加拿大	How to Immigrate From the UAE to Canada
	
!如何从阿联酋移民到加拿大	!How to immigrate to Canada from the UAE
	
加拿大有 100 种不同的移民计划和类别。如此众多的项目的意义在于迎合每一种潜在的移民。	Canada has 100 different immigration programs and streams. The significance of this number of programs is intended to cater to every kind of prospective immigrant.
	
拥有如此多的申请流和项目的意想不到的后果是，许多申请人对他们应该申请哪个移民项目感到困惑。	The unintended consequence of having so many application streams and programs you can apply to is that many applicants become confused about which immigration program they should apply for.
	
关于哪个项目适合他们以及哪个项目申请成本最低的问题是申请人选择哪个移民项目的常见决定因素。	Questions regarding which program will suit them and which program is the cheapest to apply for are frequent determinants of which immigration program applicants will choose.
	
当许多项目都提供了这些问题的答案时，只选择一个项目来申请总是具有挑战性。	When many programs provide the answers to these questions, it becomes invariably challenging to pick just one program to apply for.
	
您来自哪个国家/地区也是您有资格申请哪个国家/地区的决定性因素。考虑到这一事实，对于来自阿拉伯联合酋长国的潜在移民，我们编制了一份从阿联酋移民到加拿大的最佳方式清单。	The nation that you come from also plays a determining factor in which country you're eligible to apply for. With this fact in mind, for prospective immigrants from the United Arab Emirates, we have compiled a list of the best ways to immigrate to Canada from the UAE.
	
它们主要包括快速入境系统、省提名计划、家庭担保和商业移民。	They primarily include the Express Entry system, Provincial Nominee programs, Family Sponsorship and Business Immigration.
	
## 永久居留	Permanent Residency
	
！	!
	
如果您想以尽可能最好的条件移居加拿大，我们建议您成为永久居民。永久居留身份意味着您有权无限期地在加拿大生活、工作和学习。	If you want to move to Canada on the best terms possible we recommend becoming a permanent resident. Permanent residency status means you have the right to live, work and study in Canada indefinitely.
	
您被视为加拿大人口的一员，并享有加拿大人民的所有权利和责任。	You are treated as a member of the Canadian population and are afforded all of the rights and responsibilities of the Canadian people.
	
如果您成功获得永久居留权，您将有权享受以下福利，其中包括：	Should you be successful in obtaining permanent residency, you shall become entitled to the following benefits which include:
	
- 获得社会福利（例如获得加拿大政府医疗保健计划 Medicare）	-   Receiving social benefits (for example access to Medicare, Canada's government healthcare program)
- 能够在加拿大生活、学习或工作（只要您符合您选择居住的省份或地区的要求）	-   Being able to live, study, or work in Canada (so long as you meet the requirements of the province or territory you choose to live in)
- 申请加拿大公民身份	-   Apply for Canadian citizenship
- 作为永久居民获得保护（加拿大政府必须根据其法律体系和加拿大权利与自由宪章保护您）	-   Receive protection as a permanent resident (the Canadian government must protect you under their law system and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms)
	
关于您作为加拿大永久居民无权获得的权利的小警告包括：	A small caveat regarding what you are not entitled to as a Canadian permanent resident includes:
	
- 无法投票	-   not being able to vote
- 无法竞选公职	-   Not being able to run for office
- 无法申请和获得具有高级安全许可的工作。	-   Not being able to apply and get hired for jobs with high-level security clearances.
	
### 快速通道	Express Entry
	
Express Entry 是一个快速通道申请处理在线移民系统，管理三个联邦项目：	Express Entry is a fast-track application processing online immigration system that manages three federal programs:
	
- 联邦技术工人计划	-   Federal Skilled Worker Program
- 联邦技工项目	-   Federal Skilled Trades Program
- 加拿大体验班	-   Canadian Experience Class
	
外国技术工人可以通过快速通道系统申请获得加拿大永久居留权。	Foreign skilled workers can apply through the Express Entry system to gain Canadian permanent residency.
	
您不仅可以成为永久居民，而且可以在短短六个月内完成，使快速通道系统成为加拿大最快的移民项目之一。	Not only can you become a permanent resident, but you can do so within as little as six months, making the Express Entry system one of the fastest immigration programs in Canada.
	
要使用 Express Entry 系统进行申请，您可以执行一个相对简单的 3 步申请：	To apply using the Express Entry system there is a relatively straightforward 3 step application that you can do:
	
- 第 1 步：确定资格	-   Step 1: Determine Eligibility
- 第 2 步：创建快速通道配置文件	-   Step 2: Create an Express Entry Profile
- 第 3 步：收到申请邀请 (ITA)	-   Step 3: Receive an Invitation to Apply (ITA)
	
### 省提名项目	Provincial Nominee Programs
	
获得加拿大永久居留权的最佳途径之一是通过省提名计划 (PNP)。	One of the best ways to get permanent residency in Canada is through the Provincial Nominee Program(PNP).
	
省提名计划是为具有技能、教育和工作经验的外国技术工人创建和设计的，可以为一个省的经济做出贡献（其中大多数由于劳动力短缺而急需外国技术工人）并希望住在永久加拿大。	The Provincial Nomination Program was created and designed for skilled foreign workers with the skills, education, and work experience to contribute to a province's economy (most of which are in dire need of foreign skilled workers due to labor shortages) and who want to live in Canada permanently.
	
地方省份与政府之间达成协议，使各省份能够提名熟练的外国工人成为永久居民。根据您的技能和特定省份的需求，您可以申请这 11 个省份和地区。	Agreements were made between the local provinces and the government that enabled the provinces to nominate skilled foreign workers to become permanent residents. Depending on your skills and the needs of a particular province, you can apply to these 11 provinces and territories.
	
下面展示了每个省份的地图以及每个省份的工作机会的简要说明。	The following presents a map of each individual province and a brief description of the work opportunities in each.
	
要申请省提名计划，您必须遵循相当简单的申请途径，其中包括：	To apply to a Provincial Nominee Program you have to follow a fairly simple application route which includes:
	
- 向省或地区申请非快速通道类别下的提名；	-   Apply to the province or territory for nomination under a non-Express Entry stream;
- 您需要满足提名您的省份的资格要求；	-   You need to meet the eligibility requirements of the province that nominates you;
- 获得提名后，您需要向加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 提交永久居留的书面申请；和	-   Once you've been nominated, you need to submit a paper application for permanent residence to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC); and
- 您需要通过体检并获得无犯罪记录证明。无论您计划在加拿大的哪个地方居住，您都必须进行这些检查。	-   You are required to pass a medical exam and get a police clearance certificate. You must do these checks regardless of where you plan to live in Canada.
	
### 家庭赞助	Family Sponsorship
	
家庭担保计划允许加拿大公民和根据《印第安人法》注册的人以及加拿大永久居民担保他们的家庭成员。让我们仔细看看配偶、伴侣和子女赞助计划。要有资格担保亲属，担保人必须：	The Family Sponsorship program allows Canadian citizens and persons registered under the Indian Act and permanent residents of Canada to sponsor their family members. Let's take a closer look at the spouse, partner, and child sponsorship programs. To be eligible to sponsor a relative, a sponsor must:
	
- 年满 18 岁	-   Be 18 years or older
- 是加拿大公民、根据《加拿大印第安人法》注册的人或加拿大永久居民；	-   Be a Canadian citizen, person registered under the Canadian Indian Act, or permanent resident of Canada;
- 证明他们没有接受社会援助，除非是残疾；和	-   Prove they aren't receiving social assistance unless it's for a disability; and
- 满足他们赞助的人的基本需求	-   Provide for the basic needs of whoever they're sponsoring
	
有资格担保的人可以担保以下家庭成员：	Persons eligible to sponsor may sponsor the following family members:
	
- 他们的配偶	-   Their spouse
- 同居伴侣	-   Common-law partner
- 他们的配偶；和	-   Their conjugal partner; and
- 他们的受抚养子女	-   Their dependent children
	
通过家庭赞助计划移民加拿大的一个优势是您可以作为永久居民移居加拿大。	An advantage of immigrating to Canada via the family sponsorship program is that you can move to Canada as a permanent resident.
	
### 商业移民	Business Immigration
	
随着加拿大经济的发展，商业移民加拿大是一个绝佳的选择。加拿大的高平均生活水平、高教育水平和高度多样化的人口意味着有大量的商业增长机会。	With the Canadian economy expanding, business immigration to Canada is a fantastic option. Canada's high average standard of living, high level of education and highly diverse population mean there are abundant opportunities for business growth.
	
#### 自雇计划	Self-Employed Program
	
该计划专为能够通过在体育、文化或艺术方面为加拿大的就业市场做出贡献而创造自己的就业机会的人而设计。该计划有助于运动员或表演者获得加拿大永久居留权，只要他们继续在加拿大境内从事文化或体育活动。	This program is designed for people capable of creating their own employment by contributing athletically, culturally or artistically to Canada's job market. The program facilitates athletes or performers to get permanent residency in Canada so long as they continue their cultural or athletic endeavors within Canada.
	
要符合资格，您必须具有您将在加拿大做出重大贡献的文化或体育活动的相关经验。相关经验意味着申请人必须有至少两年的工作经验，要么参加他们选择的国际或世界级体育或文化活动，要么在该活动中自雇。	To be eligible, you must have the relevant experience in the cultural or athletic activity to which you will be making a significant contribution in Canada. Relevant experience means that applicants must have at least two years of work experience either participating in their chosen athletic or cultural activity at an international or world-class level or being self-employed in that activity.
	
申请人主要根据以下因素选择：	Applicants are primarily selected based on their:
	
-   工作经验	-   work experience
-   教育程度	-   education level
-   年龄	-   age
-   语言能力	-   language skills
	
#### 创业签证	Start-up Visa
	
加拿大创业签证计划专为希望在加拿大获得永久居留权以开展新业务或将现有企业从另一个国家带入加拿大的移民企业家而设计。该计划旨在通过引入新企业在加拿大创造就业机会来刺激加拿大经济，从而为该国注入生产技能和经验。	The Canada Start-up visa program is expressly designed for immigrant entrepreneurs looking to obtain permanent residence in Canada to either start a new business or bring an existing enterprise from another country into Canada. This program was designed to inject productive skill and experience in the country by stimulating Canada's economy through bringing in new enterprises to create jobs within Canada.
	
严格的资格标准是该计划的标志之一。要符合此计划的资格，您必须拥有合格的企业，这意味着申请人必须拥有他们带到加拿大的企业的至少 10%。申请人还必须满足加拿大的语言要求，并有足够的安置资金通过加拿大创业签证计划移民。	Strict eligibility criteria is one of this program's hallmarks. To be eligible for this program, you must have a qualifying business meaning that applicants must own at least 10% of the enterprise they're bringing to Canada. Applicants must also meet Canada's language requirements and have sufficient settlement funds to immigrate through a Canada Start-up Visa program.
	
要申请，您需要通过以下方式进行：	To apply, you need to do so via the:
	
- 加拿大政府永久居留申请门户	-   Canadian government's permanent residence application portal
- 您将收到一份说明指南，其中详细说明了他们申请所需要做的一切。	-   You will receive an instruction guide breaking down everything they need to do to apply.
