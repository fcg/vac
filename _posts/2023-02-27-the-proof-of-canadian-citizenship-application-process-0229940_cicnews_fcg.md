# 加拿大公民身份证明申请程序 加拿大允许亲生父母和合法父母将公民身份传给在国外出生的孩子，前提是孩子出生时父母是第一代加拿大人。	The Proof of Canadian Citizenship application process Canada allows biological and legal parents to pass on citizenship to their children born outside the country, if at the time of the child's birth, the parents were first generation Canadians. 
要确定一个人是否是加拿大公民并获得一份称为“加拿大公民证书”的文件，必须向加拿大政府提交“加拿大公民身份证明”申请。	To determine if a person is a Canadian citizen and to be issued a document called a “Canadian citizenship certificate,” a “Proof of Canadian citizenship” application must be submitted to the Canadian government.
	
加拿大公民证书可颁发给在加拿大出生的人、在加拿大境外出生且父母为加拿大人的人，或已获得加拿大公民身份的永久居民。	Canadian citizenship certificates can be issued to a person born in Canada, a person born outside of Canada to a Canadian parent, or to a permanent resident who has obtained Canadian citizenship.
	
公民身份是指一个人的法律地位。加拿大公民身份可以通过出生或通过称为“入籍”的过程获得。	Citizenship refers to a person’s legal status. Canadian citizenship can be obtained either by birth or by a process called “naturalization.”
	
来到加拿大定居并符合特定条件的移民可能有资格通过入籍申请加拿大公民身份。获得加拿大公民身份是许多移民移民过程的最后一步。	Immigrants who come and settle in Canada and meet certain criteria may be eligible to apply for Canadian citizenship by naturalization. Being granted Canadian citizenship is the final step in the immigration process for many immigrants.
	
加拿大人可能会寻求将其公民身份传给在国外出生的孩子的原因有很多。其中包括在世界上最繁荣和最稳定的国家之一生活和工作的机会，或者获得可以免签前往 100 多个国家/地区旅行的加拿大护照。它还可以用作获得各种服务和福利（如养老金）、申请工作或投票的证明。	There are many reasons why Canadians may seek to pass on their citizenship status to their foreign-born children. These include the opportunity to live and work in what is one of the most prosperous and stable countries in the world, or to have access to a Canadian passport that allows visa-free travel to well over 100 countries. It can also be used as proof of access to various services and benefits, such as a pension, to apply for a job or to vote.
	
### 如何申请加拿大公民证？	How do I apply for a Canadian citizenship certificate?
	
通常情况下，公民身份证明申请是由父母在加拿大出生并且认为自己有资格获得加拿大公民身份但不确定的成年人提交的。此外，此类申请由加拿大父母代表其在国外出生的孩子提交，或由孩子自己提交。	Typically, applications for proof of citizenship are submitted by adults who have a Canadian-born parent and who believe they are eligible for Canadian citizenship but are not certain. In addition, such applications are submitted by Canadian parents on behalf of their foreign-born children, or by the children themselves.
	
IRCC 要求证明孩子出生时至少有一位亲生父母或合法父母是加拿大公民。证明的例子包括父母的出生证明、公民卡或公民证。强调这一点很重要，因为目前在加拿大，血统公民身份仅限于通过出生或归化成为公民的加拿大父母。换句话说，通过血统获得公民身份的加拿大人无权将其公民身份传给子女，除非孩子在加拿大出生。	IRCC requires proof that at least one biological or legal parent was a Canadian citizen when the child was born. Examples of proof include the parent’s birth certificate, citizenship card, or citizenship certificate.  This point is important to emphasize because currently, in Canada, citizenship by descent is limited to Canadian parents who have themselves become citizens by birth or naturalization. In other words, Canadians who have acquired citizenship by descent are not entitled to pass on their citizenship to their children unless the children were born in Canada.
	
可以在线或纸质提交公民身份证明申请。	Proof of citizenship applications can be submitted online or on paper.
	
向加拿大政府申请的总费用为 75 加元。	The total cost of the application to the Canadian government is $75 CAD.
	
IRCC 然后审查申请以确保其完整。然后您将收到“收据确认书”。如果您的文件很复杂，IRCC 可能需要与您联系以获取更多信息或文件。 IRCC 可能还需要更多时间来处理复杂的文件。	IRCC then reviews the application to ensure it is complete. You will then receive an “acknowledgment of receipt.” If your file is complicated, IRCC may need to contact you for additional information or documents. IRCC may also need more time to process complicated files.
