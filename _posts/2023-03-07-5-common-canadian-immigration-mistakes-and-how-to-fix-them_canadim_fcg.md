## 1\。在您的主要 NOC 代码中拥有不到一年的连续全职经验	1\. Having less than one year of continuous full-time experience in your primary NOC code
	
在您的 Express Entry 档案中指明您的主要 NOC 代码表明您的连续全职工作经验_少于_一年（每周 30 小时），或者_不_属于 TEER 类别 0、1、2 或 3 的代码，将会自动拒绝。	Indicating a primary NOC code on your Express Entry profile that you have _less_ than a year of continuous full-time experience (30 hours/week), or a code that _doesn’t_ fall under TEER category 0, 1, 2 or 3, will be an automatic rejection.
	
**解决方案：** 只提供一个主要的 NOC 代码，您可以证明您在过去十年中至少有一年的熟练全职工作经验。您还应该知道，无论您指定什么作为您的主要 NOC 代码，都不会影响您在加拿大的就业前景。一旦您成为加拿大永久居民，您就可以自由地从事您希望从事的任何职位或行业。	**Solution:** Only indicate a primary NOC code that you can prove you have at least one year, in the last ten years, of skilled, full-time work experience. You should also be aware that whatever you indicate as your primary NOC code will not affect your employment prospects in Canada. Once you are a Canadian permanent resident, you are free to work in any position or industry you wish.

## 2\。没有证明有意居住在魁北克以外的地方	2\. Not proving intention to reside outside of Quebec
	
如果您目前在魁北克生活或工作，并打算在成功完成移民申请后留在魁北克，您最好申请魁北克移民计划。也就是说，仅仅因为你住在魁北克并不意味着你不能通过快速通道系统申请。无论是联邦移民还是魁北克移民申请的结果都是一样的，加拿大永居。作为加拿大永久居民，您在加拿大任何地方生活和工作的权利都受到加拿大权利和自由宪章的保护。	If you are currently living or working in Quebec and intend to stay in Quebec after the successful completion of your immigration application, you should ideally apply for a Quebec immigration program. That said, just because you are living in Quebec doesn’t mean you can’t apply through the Express Entry system. The results of both federal or Quebec immigration applications are the same, Canadian permanent residence. As a Canadian permanent resident, your right to live and work anywhere in Canada is protected under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
	
**解决方案：** 向签证官提供足够的证据，证明虽然您现在可能在魁北克工作或生活，但在您的快速入境申请获得批准后，您将搬到魁北克省以外的地方。该证明可以有多种形式，但建议在您的申请中包含您打算居住在魁北克以外的宣誓声明。	**Solution:** Provide the visa officer with sufficient proof that although you may be working or living in Quebec now, upon approval of your Express Entry application, you will move outside the province of Quebec. This proof can come in many forms but a sworn declaration of your intent to reside outside Quebec is advisable to include in your application.
	
## 3\。等待提交时间过长	3\. Waiting too long to submit
	
任何有合格申请的人都应该尽快提交，而他们仍然可以。省提名项目经常变化，移民类别开放和关闭也很快。如果您在 Express Entry 池中没有申请，您可能会错过移民机会。	Anyone who has a qualifying application should submit as soon as possible, while they still can. Provincial nominee programs change frequently and immigration categories open and close quickly. If you don’t have an application in the Express Entry pool, you could miss out on immigration opportunities.
	
**解决方案：**一旦您有资格申请，请尽快提交您的申请。	**Solution:** Submit your application as soon as you are eligible to apply.
	
## 4\。不能证明工作经验的就业推荐信	4\. Employment reference letters that don’t prove work experience
	
当大多数人想到就业推荐信时，他们会想到您从前任老板或主管那里收到的一份文件，其中概述了您的技能和成就以及未来雇主应雇用您的原因。这些对你的职业生涯很有帮助，但它们不会帮助你申请加拿大移民。	When most people think of employment reference letters they think of a document you received from your old boss or supervisor outlining your skills and accomplishments and why a future employer should hire you. These are great for your professional career but they will not help you with your application for Canadian immigration.
	
快速通道的推荐信要求您证明：	Reference letters for Express Entry require you to demonstrate:
	
1. 你的正式职位	1.  Your official job title
2. 您的受雇日期	2.  The dates of your employment
3. 你的工资	3.  Your salary
4. 你每周的平均工作时间	4.  Your average hours per week
5. 您的工作职责的详细清单	5.  A detailed list of your employment duties
	
**解决方案：** 提供任何可以满足上述要求的文件。例如，如果官方推荐信没有提及您的薪水，请提供工资单。再举一个例子，如果您的就业文件没有提供就业职责，请从主管或同事那里获得您日常工作的宣誓声明。应该提到的是，关于您的就业文件的最终决定由签证官自行决定，但您可以提供的支持文件越多，您的案子就越有说服力。	**Solution:** Provide whatever documents you can to satisfy the requirements mentioned above. For example, if an official reference letter doesn’t mention your salary, provide payslips. As another example, if your employment documentation doesn’t provide employment duties, get a sworn declaration of your daily tasks from a supervisor or colleague. It should be mentioned that the final decision regarding your employment documentation is at the discretion of the visa officer but the more supporting documents you can provide, the stronger your case will be.

## 5\。失实陈述	5\. Misrepresentation
	
虚假陈述是严重的移民违法行为。这可能会导致您的快速入境申请被拒绝，并且您可能会被禁止在几年内申请加拿大移民。	Misrepresentation is a severe immigration offence. It can lead to your Express Entry application being refused and you could be barred from applying for Canadian immigration for several years.
	
**解决方案：**如实告知您申请的详细信息，包括您的职业经历以及您或您申请时随行的任何人遇到的任何医疗或犯罪问题。并非所有的医疗问题都是加拿大移民的障碍；以前的犯罪记录也是如此。如果您不确定什么值得一提，什么不值得一提，您可以咨询移民律师或简单地列出任何值得关注的事项，然后由签证官自行决定。	**Solution:** Be as honest about the details of your application, including your career history and any medical or criminality issues that you, or anyone accompanying you on your application, have had. Not all medical problems are a barrier to Canadian immigration; the same is true for a previous criminal record. If you aren’t sure what is and isn’t worth mentioning, you can consult an immigration attorney or simply list anything of concern and leave it to the discretion of the visa officer.
