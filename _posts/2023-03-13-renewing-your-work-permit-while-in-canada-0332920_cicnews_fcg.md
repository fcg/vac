# 在加拿大期间更新您的工作许可 在 IRCC 处理您的申请期间，您可以继续工作。	Renewing your work permit while in Canada You may be able to continue working while IRCC processes your application.
如果您的工作许可即将到期，或者您想更改工作许可的条件，您必须在工作许可到期前至少 30 天提交新的申请。在加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 处理您的申请期间，您可以合法地留在加拿大。	If you have a work permit that is going to expire or you want to make changes to the conditions of your work permit, you must submit a new application at least 30 days before your work permit expires. You are legally allowed to stay in Canada while Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) processes your application.
	
如果您当前的工作发生变化，例如薪酬或新职责发生变化，如果您获得不同的工作或您想为新雇主工作，您的工作许可证的条件也会发生变化。您不得开始从事新工作或为不同的雇主工作，您将获得符合新条件的新工作许可证。	The conditions of your work permit change if there are changes to your current job such as a change in pay or new responsibilities, if you are offered a different job or you want to work for a new employer. You are not allowed to start working a new job or work for a different employer you get a new work permit with the new conditions.
	
如果您有开放式工作许可，只要您仍然有资格持开放式工作许可在加拿大工作，您就可以延长它。	If you have an open work permit, you are permitted to extend it as long as you are still eligible to work in Canada with an open work permit.
	
### 如何申请	How to apply
	
在大多数情况下，您必须在线申请延期或更改工作许可的条件。要在线申请，您需要拥有文件的电子副本，并且必须支付申请处理费。	In most cases, you must apply online to extend or change the conditions of your work permit. To apply online, you will need to have electronic copies of your documents and will have to pay processing fees for the application.
	
在上传表格之前，您必须回答一些问题。您还将创建一个帐户，以便您可以提交申请并检查您的状态。如果 IRCC 接受您的申请，您将获得当前工作许可的延期或新工作条件的工作许可。	Before you upload your forms, you must answer some questions. You will also create an account so that you can submit your application and check your status. If IRCC accepts your application, you will either get an extension of your current work permit or a work permit for the new working conditions.
	
### 我可以使用过期的工作许可证工作吗？	Can I work with an expired work permit?
	
如果您的工作许可在 IRCC 处理您的申请时过期，您必须确定您是否被允许继续工作。	If your work permit expires while IRCC is processing your application, you must determine if you are allowed to keep working.
	
如果您申请延长您的工作许可证然后到期，您仍然保持您的身份。因此，在对您的申请做出决定之前，您有权在没有许可证的情况下工作，只要您在与当前（或过期）许可证相同的条件下工作。	If you applied to extend your work permit and then it expires, you have maintained your status. You are therefore authorized to work without a permit until a decision is made on your application, as long as you are working under the same conditions as your current (or expired) permit.
	
如果您申请新的工作许可证以更改您的雇主、工作或工作地点，然后您当前的许可证到期，您也保持了您的身份。因此，在 IRCC 对您的申请做出决定之前，您有权继续工作，但只能为您原始工作许可证上指定的雇主工作。在处理申请之前，您不能根据新工作许可的条件开始工作。	If you applied for a new work permit to either change your employer, job or work location, and then your current permit expires, you have also maintained your status. You are therefore authorized to continue to work, but only for the employer named on your original work permit until IRCC makes a decision about your application. You cannot start working under the conditions of the new work permit until the application is processed.
	
最后，如果您申请学习许可或以访客身份延长在加拿大的逗留时间，您只能工作到许可到期为止。一旦到期，您必须停止工作。您也可以在 IRCC 处理您的申请之前才开始学习。	Finally, if you applied for a study permit or to extend your stay in Canada as a visitor, you may only work until your permit expires. Once it expires, you must stop working. You may also only begin to start studying until IRCC processes your application.
	
重要的是要注意，您不允许将工作许可延期到护照到期日之后。	It is important to note that you not permitted to extend your work permit beyond your passports expiry date.
	
### 我如何向我的雇主证明我可以继续工作？	How can I prove to my employer that I can keep working?
	
在您申请延长或续签您的工作许可后，IRCC 将向您发送一份后者，您可以将其用作证明您有资格在与原始工作许可相同的条件下继续工作的证明。 IRCC 表示，如果申请仍在处理中，只要您的工作条件保持不变，您甚至可以在信函到期后继续工作。	After you apply to extend or renew your work permit, IRCC will send you a latter that you can use as proof that you are eligible to keep working under the same conditions as your original work permit. IRCC states that if the application is still being processed, you can even continue to work past the expiry date while on the letter as long as your working conditions remain the same.
	
### 如果我的许可证在我申请更新之前就过期了怎么办？	What if my permit expires before I apply to renew it?
	
如果您的工作许可在您申请新许可之前已过期，如果您在加拿大，则必须停止工作。但是，您可以恢复您的工作身份。如果您符合以下条件，您可以申请恢复您的工作身份：	If your work permit expired before you applied for a new one, you must stop working if you are in Canada. However, you may be able to restore your status as a worker. You can apply to restore your status as a worker if you:
	
- 在失去身份后 90 天内申请	-   Apply within 90 days of losing your status
- 满足您的逗留要求（例如，您没有非法工作）	-   Meet the requirements for your stay (ex. you did not work illegally)
- 在过期前满足过期许可证上列出的所有条件	-   Meet all the conditions listed on your expired permit before it expired
	
IRCC 声明不保证他们会批准您的申请以恢复您的身份或获得新的许可证。	IRCC states that there is no guarantee that they will approve your application to restore your status or for a new permit.
