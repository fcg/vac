Canadim 团队非常重视加拿大移民欺诈。不幸的是，欺诈是我们行业中普遍存在的问题。有许多不道德的个人和公司提供收费的移民服务，然后卷走客户的钱，或利用他们的身份从事其他犯罪活动。了解如何保护自己。	The Canadim Team take Canadian Immigration fraud very seriously. Unfortunately, fraud is a prevalent problem in our industry. There are many unscrupulous individuals and companies that offer immigration services for a fee, then run away with their clients’ money, or use their identities for other criminal activities. Learn how you can protect yourself.
		
以下是我们在与潜在移民代表接触时需要注意的五个危险信号：	Here are our top five red flags to look out for when engaging with a potential immigration representative:
	
### 1\。您收到未经请求的电话或电子邮件	1\. You receive an unsolicited phone call or email
	
如果您收到自称是移民律师或顾问，或来自加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 的人发来的电子邮件，表明**您没有招揽**，这可能是骗局。除非您之前提交过评估或以其他方式联系过任何一方，否则他们不太可能会自发地联系您。	If you receive an email from someone claiming to be an immigration lawyer or consultant, or to be from Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), that **you did not solicit**, it may be a scam. Unless you have previously submitted an assessment or otherwise contacted any of these parties, it is very unlikely that they would spontaneously reach out to you.
	
### 2\。您无法在网上找到公司或事务所	2\. You cannot find the company or firm online
	
所有加拿大公司和公司都有一些在线业务。通常，他们会出现在 Facebook 等社交媒体上，并拥有自己的网站。如果您无法通过 Google 搜索与您联系的人所在的公司或公司，或者如果您找到的网站看起来可疑，则可能是骗局。另外，请确保检查他们电子邮件地址的域名。如果它是 Gmail 或 Hotmail 等通用电子邮件提供商，请将其视为一个主要危险信号。合法的公司通常不允许员工使用他们的个人电子邮件来开展业务。	All Canadian companies and firms have some online presence. Usually, they’ll be present on social media like Facebook and have their own website. If you cannot Google the company or firm of the person contacting you, or if the website you do find seems suspicious, it may be a scam. Also, make sure you check the domain name of their email address. If it’s a generic email provider like Gmail or Hotmail, consider this a major red flag. Legitimate companies usually do not allow employees to use their personal email to conduct business.
	
#### 标志网站可疑	Signs a website is suspicious
	
1) 该网站为想要移民、保证进入加拿大或更快处理您的申请的人提供特别优惠。	1) The website offers special deals to people who want to immigrate, guaranteed entry into Canada, or faster processing of your application.
	
2) 当您登陆该网站时浏览器地址栏中的 URL 与您输入的不同。如果发生这种情况，您已被重定向，这可能表明该网站是假网站。	2) The URL in your browser’s address bar when you land on the site is different than the one you typed in. If this happens, you have been redirected and this may indicate a fake website.
	
3) 该网站没有“联系我们”页面，或“联系我们”页面上的信息无效。	3) The website does not have a ‘Contact Us’ page, or the information on the ‘Contact Us’ page is not valid.
	
4) 任何询问个人信息的网页都应显示锁形，并以“https://”开头。这表明该页面有一个 SSL 证书，可以加密和保护页面上提供的信息。中间的信息解释了 SSL 证书颁发给了谁。例如，我们的免费在线评估页面是安全的，SSL 证书颁发给“Renaud Dery Avocat inc.”：	4) Any web page asking for personal information should display a lock, and start with “https://”. This indicates that the page has an SSL certificate that encrypts and secures the information provided on it. The information in between explains who the SSL certificate was issued to. For example, our free online assessment page is secure, and the SSL certificate was issued to “Renaud Dery Avocat inc.”:
	
### 3\。你保证有工作或签证	3\. You are guaranteed a job or visa
	
**没有人**可以保证您能找到工作或获得加拿大签证。您应该非常警惕做出此类承诺的个人。只有加拿大驻加拿大大使馆、高级专员公署和领事馆的移民官员才能决定签发签证。在 Canadim，我们为客户提供非常高的成功率，但我们绝对不保证获得加拿大签证。如果您支付额外费用，承诺有保证的签证或工作是您与骗子打交道的最明显的危险信号。	**No one** can guarantee you a job or visa to Canada. You should be very wary of individuals making such promises. Only immigration officers in Canada, at Canadian embassies, high commissions and consulates can decide to issue a visa. At Canadim we have a very high success rate for our clients, but we absolutely never guarantee a Canadian visa. Promises of guaranteed visas or jobs if you pay a extra are the most obvious red flag that you are dealing with a scammer.
	
### 4\。您被要求将钱存入个人银行账户，或以其他不寻常的方式支付费用	4\. You are being asked to deposit money into a personal bank account, or to pay fees in other unusual ways
	
您向合法移民律师、顾问或加拿大政府支付的款项绝不会存入个人银行账户。当您向 Canadim 付款时，您的付款将通过我们的网站安全地在线进行。	Payments that you make to a legitimate immigration lawyer, consultant, or to the Government of Canada will never be made out to personal bank accounts. When you pay Canadim, your payments are made online securely through out website.
	
### 5\。您的代表无法证明他们的认证	5\. Your representative cannot prove their certification
	
法律允许接受加拿大移民服务付款的代表只有两种：律师和移民顾问。	There are only two types of representatives that are legally allowed to accept payment for Canadian immigration services: lawyers and immigration consultants.
	
#### 律师	Lawyers
	
加拿大律师都在他们执业的省份的律师协会注册。如果有人声称自己是加拿大移民律师，他们应该能够提供他们的认证证明。例如，您可以在 Barreau du Québec 网站上找到 Attorney Renaud Dery。这表明他是魁北克省的合格律师。如需省和地区律师协会的完整列表，请访问政府网页“了解您的代表是否获得授权”。	Canadian lawyers are all registered with the law society of the province that they practice in. If someone claims to be a Canadian immigration lawyer, they should be able to provide proof of their certification. For instance, you can find Attorney Renaud Dery on the Barreau du Québec website. This indicates that he is a qualified attorney in the province of Québec. For a complete list of provincial and territorial law societies, visit the government webpage ‘Find out if your representative is authorized‘.
	
#### 移民顾问	Immigration Consultants
	
公民或移民顾问必须是移民和公民顾问学院 (CICC) 的成员。您可以在其专用网页上找到所有受监管的加拿大移民顾问 (RCIC) 的登记处。非中金公司监管的顾问收费提供加拿大移民服务属于违法行为。	Citizenship or immigration consultants must be a member of the College of Immigration and Citizenship Consultants (CICC). You can find a registry of all Regulated Canadian Immigration Consultants (RCICs) on their dedicated webpage. It is illegal for a consultant not regulated by CICC to provide Canadian immigration services for a fee.
	
如果您认为自己已成为移民欺诈的受害者该怎么办	What to do if you believe you've been made a victim of immigration fraud
	
#### 如果您在加拿大：	If you are in Canada:
	
联系加拿大皇家骑警加拿大反欺诈中心。	Contact the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre.
	
免费电话：1-888-495-8501	Toll-free: 1-888-495-8501
	
#### 如果您不在加拿大：	If you are Outside of Canada:
	
向当地警方报告诈骗。	Report the scam to your local police.
