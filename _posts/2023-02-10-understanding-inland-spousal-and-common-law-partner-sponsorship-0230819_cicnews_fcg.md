###申请步骤	Application steps
	
注意：居住在魁北克省的内陆担保候选人必须遵循不同的申请步骤。有关这些步骤的详细信息，请参见此处。	Note: Inland sponsorship hopefuls living in the province of Quebec will have to follow different application steps. Details regarding these steps can be found here.
	
内陆担保申请涉及六个关键步骤。	There are six key steps involved with inland sponsorship applications.
	
第 1 步：关系中的加拿大公民或永久居民必须申请有资格履行其作为担保人的职责。此申请必须与外国配偶或伴侣的担保申请同时发送，并将包含在第二步所述的申请包中	Step 1: The Canadian citizen or permanent resident in the relationship must apply to become eligible to fulfill their role as a sponsor. This application must be sent at the same time as the application for sponsorship of the foreign national spouse or partner and will be included within the application package described in step two
	
第二步：获取在政府网站上找到的申请包；它包括一份指南、说明和表格以及一份清单，可帮助您正确完成该过程	Step 2: Obtain the application package found on the government website; it includes a guide, with instructions and forms as well as a checklist that will help you complete the process correctly
	
第 3 步：在线支付所有必需的申请费用（申请费用、永久居留权费用、生物识别费用）	Step 3: Pay all required application fees online (application fees, right of permanent residence fees, biometric fees)
	
第 4 步：填写并签署所有必需的表格	Step 4: Complete and sign all required forms
	
第 5 步：按照您下载的指南中提供的说明，将您的申请发送到加拿大正确的签证办公室和邮寄地址	Step 5: Send your application to the right visa office and mailing address in Canada by following the instructions provided in the guide you downloaded
	
第 6 步：在审核申请期间，您可能会被要求提交其他证明文件	Step 6: While the application is under review, you may be asked to submit additional supporting documents
	
### 申请处理	Application processing
	
此赞助途径的申请需要提交至 IRCC 确定的特定邮寄地址（在上述第一步中提到的指南中提供），通常需要大约 12 个月的时间来处理。	Applications for this sponsorship pathway will need to be submitted to a specific mailing address identified by IRCC (provided in the guide mentioned in step one above) and they typically take approximately 12 months to process.
	
普遍的期望是，此赞助流中的申请人将在申请处理期间留在加拿大。如果外国申请人无法做到这一点，则外地配偶和同居伴侣担保可能是更好的选择。	The general expectation is that applicants in this sponsorship stream will remain in Canada during application processing. Should this not be possible for the foreign national applicant, outland spousal and common-law partner sponsorship may be a better option.
