准新移民经常问我们加拿大永久居民与公民之间的区别。永久居留是指移民到加拿大并获得加拿大永久居民身份的个人。永久居民不是加拿大公民，而是另一个国家的公民。	We are often asked by prospective newcomers the difference between a Canadian permanent resident vs citizen.  Permanent residence refers to an individual who has immigrated to Canada and who has been given permanent resident status in Canada. A permanent resident is not a citizen of Canada, but of another country.

许多加拿大的准移民都对获得加拿大公民身份感兴趣。但在您成为加拿大公民之前，您首先必须是加拿大永久居民。事实上，每个加拿大移民计划（包括 PNP 或魁北克移民等省级途径）的最终结果都是加拿大永久居留权。	Many prospective immigrants to Canada are interested in getting Canadian citizenship. But before you can become a Canadian citizen, you first must be a Canadian permanent resident. In fact, the end result of every Canadian immigration program (including provincial pathways like PNPs or Quebec Immigration) is Canadian permanent residence.
	
一旦您成为永久居民，您将自动获得永久居留 (PR) 卡。永久居民卡基本上相当于加拿大的美国绿卡。	Once you become a permanent resident, you are automatically issued a permanent residence (PR) card. A PR card is basically the Canadian equivalent of a US green card.
	
一旦个人成为加拿大永久居民，他们将享有多项权利，包括：	Once an individual becomes a Canadian permanent resident, they have a number of rights including:
	
1. 获得与任何加拿大公民相同的社会福利，包括医疗保险；	1.  Access to the same social benefits as any Canadian citizen, including healthcare coverage;
2. 在加拿大任何地方生活、工作、学习的权利；	2.  The right to live, work, study anywhere in Canada;
3. 受加拿大法律和加拿大权利与自由宪章的保护；	3.  Protection under Canadian law and the Canadian _Charter of Rights and Freedoms_;
4. 申请加拿大公民身份的权利。	4.  The right to apply for Canadian citizenship.
	
在某人成为公民之前，他们必须先成为永久居民。以下是加拿大永久居民与公民之间的三个主要区别：	Before someone can become a citizen, they must first become a permanent resident. Here are three of the main differences between Canadian permanent residents vs citizens:
	
## 1\。投票或竞选公职的能力	1\. Ability to Vote or Run for Office
	
加拿大永久居民还承担许多加拿大公民的社会责任，例如纳税和遵守加拿大法律。事实上，只有两件事是加拿大公民可以做的，而永久居民不能做的。加拿大永久居民不能投票或竞选公职。对于担任某些需要高级安全许可的政府职位的永久居民也有一些限制。	Canadian permanent residents also share many of the social responsibilities of Canadian citizenship, such as paying taxes and abiding by Canadian laws. In fact, there are really only two things that Canadian citizens can do that permanent resident can’t. Canadian permanent residents cannot vote or run for office. There are also some restrictions against permanent residents holding certain government positions that require a high-level security clearance.
	
## 2\。加拿大护照与永久居民卡	2\. Canadian Passport vs PR Card
	
加拿大永久居民没有加拿大护照。如果永久居民想出国旅行，他们可以使用有效的永久居民卡或永久居民旅行证件 (PRTD) 以及他们所在国家/地区的护照。	Canadian permanent residents do not get a Canadian passport. If permanent residents want to travel outside the country, they can do so on a valid PR card, or on a Permanent Resident Travel Document (PRTD), and their passport from their country of citizenship.
	
永久居民卡有有效期，所以必须定期更新。但是，如果您的永久居民卡过期，您不会自动失去永久居民身份。要保持您的永久居民身份，您确实需要满足某些居住要求。	PR cards have a validity period, so they have to be renewed regularly. However, you do not automatically lose your permanent resident status if your PR card expires. To maintain your permanent resident status, you do need to meet certain residency requirements.
	
## 3\。在加拿大境外居住的能力	3\. Ability to Live Outside of Canada
	
作为永久居民，您可以在加拿大境外居住。但是，您必须在五年内至少在加拿大居住两年。如果您在加拿大境外居住的时间更长，您可能会失去身份。不过，确实存在例外。例如，陪伴加拿大公民的配偶或同居伴侣或父母在加拿大境外度过的时间可以计入居住时间。如果您被加拿大企业分配到加拿大境外的职位，您也可以计算在国外度过的时间。	As a permanent resident, you are allowed to live outside of Canada. However, you must live in Canada for at least two years in a five-year period. If you live outside of Canada for longer, you may lose your status. Exceptions do exist, though. For example, time spent outside Canada while accompanying a spouse or common-law partner, or parent who is a Canadian citizen can be counted towards residency. You can also count time spent abroad if you are assigned to a position outside Canada by a Canadian business.
	
即使您不符合居住要求，您也不会自动失去永久居留身份。如果您通过正式程序，您只能失去您的身份。	Even if you fail to meet residency requirements, you do not automatically lose permanent residence status. You can only lose your status if you go through a formal process.
	
一旦满足特定的居住要求，永久居民就可以申请入籍。作为加拿大入籍公民，他们可以申请加拿大护照，可以自由参与加拿大政治。事实上，入籍公民和在加拿大出生的公民之间绝对没有区别。	Permanent residents can apply for citizenship once they have met certain residency requirements. As a naturalized citizen of Canada, they can apply for a Canadian passport and can freely participate in Canadian politics. In fact, there are absolutely no differences between naturalized citizens and citizens born in Canada.
	
除了参与加拿大政治的能力之外，永久居民与公民之间最显着的区别是必须保持永久居留权。一旦您成为加拿大公民，您无需做任何事情来维持您的公民身份。如果您选择放弃，您只能失去加拿大公民身份。	Other than the ability to participate in Canadian politics, the most significant difference between a permanent resident vs citizen is that permanent residence must be maintained. Once you are a Canadian citizen, you do not need to do anything to maintain your citizenship. You can only lose your Canadian citizenship if you choose to renounce it.
