艾伯塔省将家庭亲属添加到艾伯塔省快速入境计划的资格标准中在艾伯塔省有直系亲属的候选人现在可以根据艾伯塔省快速入境计划获得额外考虑。	Alberta adds family relatives to eligibility criteria for the Alberta Express Entry program Candidates who have immediate family relatives in Alberta can now receive extra consideration under the Alberta Express Entry program.
	
1 月 18 日，作为艾伯塔省省提名计划的艾伯塔省优势移民计划 (AAIP) 将在该省拥有亲属添加到艾伯塔省快速入境流（由 AAIP 管理）的候选人选择标准中。	On January 18th, the Alberta Advantage Immigration Program (AAIP), which functions as Alberta’s Provincial Nominee Program, added having relatives in the province to their candidate selection criteria for the Alberta Express Entry stream (managed under the AAIP).
	
这意味着（立即生效）联邦快速通道池中被列为在该省有直系亲属（父母、子女、兄弟或姐妹是加拿大永久居民或公民）的候选人现在将满足额外的选择因素标准.这可以进一步让候选人有更好的机会从艾伯塔省快速通道流中收到意向通知 (NOI)，并进一步被邀请申请永久居留权。请注意，资格取决于候选人提交给他们在联邦快速通道池中的个人资料的信息。	This means that (effective immediately) candidates in the federal Express Entry pool who are listed as having immediate family relatives (parent, child, brother, or sister who are permanent residents or citizens of Canada) in the province will now meet added selection factor criteria. This can further give candidates a better chance of receiving a Notification of Interest (NOI) from the Alberta Express Entry stream, and further be invited to apply for permanent residence. Note that eligibility is based on information candidates submit to their profile in the federal Express Entry pool.
	
艾伯塔省认为，这些直系亲属关系对于帮助新移民在该省立足并在艾伯塔省成功定居至关重要。	Alberta believes that these immediate family ties are critical to helping new immigrants establish themselves in the province and settle successfully in Alberta.
	
重要的是，AAIP 下任何流的选择标准都没有改变，此程序更新仅影响艾伯塔省快速通道流，并且仅添加此选择标准而不影响现有的选择因素（例如从艾伯塔省的公司获得工作机会） , 是艾伯塔大专院校的毕业生等）。	Importantly none of the selection criteria for any of the streams under the AAIP have changed, this program update only impacts the Alberta Express Entry stream, and only adds this selection criteria without impacting existing selection factors (like having a job offer from a company in Alberta, being a graduate of an Albertan post-secondary institution, etc.).
	
“这不是家庭团聚计划”，艾伯塔省贸易、移民和多元文化部长 Rajan Sawhney 说。根据变化，艾伯塔省快速通道流现在能够将 25% 的 NOI 分配给在艾伯塔省有直系亲属关系，并且在该省需要工人的紧缺职业方面有经验的个人。	“This is not a family reunification plan” said Minister of Trade, Immigration and Multiculturism in Alberta, Rajan Sawhney. Per the change the Alberta Express Entry stream is now able to allocate 25% of its NOIs to individuals with both immediate family ties in Alberta, and who have experience in in-demand occupations that the province requires workers for.
	
AAIP 是帮助雇主解决艾伯塔省劳动力短缺问题的一种方式。该省仅在上个月就经历了巨大的增长，到 2022 年 12 月就增加了近 41,000 个新工作岗位，其中大部分在私营部门。然而，艾伯塔省的职位空缺率也很高，目前有近 100,000 个职位空缺——进一步预测，到 2025 年，多个职业和部门的累计短缺人数将超过 33,000 人。这些都是推动该省吸引更多新移民的关键原因。	The AAIP serves as a means to help employers address labour shortages in Alberta. The province has experienced massive growth in the last month alone, adding almost 41,000 new jobs in December of 2022, most of which were in the private sector. However, Alberta also has a high rate of job vacancies, with nearly 100,000 currently—and a further predicted cumulative shortage of over 33,000 workers across multiple occupation and sectors by 2025. These are key reasons behind the push for more newcomers in the province.
	
### 什么是 AAIP 和艾伯塔省快速通道流？	What is the AAIP and the Alberta Express Entry stream?
	
AAIP 是艾伯塔省的省级移民计划，旨在欢迎来自国外的新移民进入该省。该计划目前管理八个类别，大致分为工人类别和企业家类别。	The AAIP is Alberta’s provincial immigration program to welcome newcomers into the province from abroad. There are eight streams currently managed by the program, broadly divided into streams for workers, and streams for entrepreneurs.
	
工人的流包括：	Streams for workers include:
	
* 阿尔伯塔机会流；	  The Alberta Opportunity stream;
* 艾伯塔省快速通道流，其中还包括艾伯塔省加速技术途径 (AATP)；和	  The Alberta Express Entry stream, which also includes the Alberta Accelerated Tech Pathway (AATP); and
* 乡村振兴流。	  The Rural Renewal stream.
	
要获得艾伯塔省快速通道的资格，候选人必须：	To be eligible for the Alberta Express Entry stream, candidates must:
	
* 在联邦快速通道池中拥有活跃的档案（最好有超过 5 个月的有效期）；	  Have an active profile in the federal Express Entry pool (ideally with more than 5 months validity);
* 明确表示有兴趣永久移居艾伯塔省；	  Have a stated interest in moving to Alberta permanently;
* 正在或有经验从事支持艾伯塔省经济发展和多元化的紧缺职业；和	  Are working or have experience working in an in-demand occupation that supports Alberta’s economic development and diversification; and
* 最低 CRS 分数为 300。	  Have a minimum CRS score of 300.
	
现在，候选人如果还满足以下条件，则更有可能收到申请邀请：	Candidates now stand a better chance of receiving an invitation to apply if they also:
	
* 有有效的工作机会和/或艾伯塔省工作经验；	  Have a valid job offer and/or Albertan work experience;
* 毕业于艾伯塔省的大专院校；或者	  Are a graduate of a post-secondary institution in Alberta; or
* 目前居住在艾伯塔省的父母、子女、兄弟或姐妹是公民或永久居民。	  Have a parent, child, brother or sister currently residing in Alberta who is a citizen or permanent residence.
	
要进入候选人必须首先向联邦快速进入池提交个人资料。如果选择并颁发了 NOI，候选人必须通过电子邮件将文件副本发送给 AAIP，并声明他们有兴趣申请。	To enter candidates must first submit a profile to the federal express entry pool. If selected and issued an NOI, candidates must email a copy of the document to the AAIP and state that they are interested in applying.
	
如果 AAIP 确定候选人符合最低资格标准，他们将收到一封电子邮件，邀请他们申请该计划。从这里开始，候选人（现在是申请人）必须提交申请才能申请，并将在联邦池中获得额外的 600 CRS 积分（作为增强的省级提名）。然后将完整的申请放入符合条件的申请库中进行处理。	If the AAIP determines that candidates meet the minimum eligibility criteria they will receive an email inviting them to apply to the program. From here candidates (now applicants) must submit an application to apply and will receive an additional 600 CRS points, in the federal pool (functioning as an enhanced provincial nomination). Complete applications are then placed in a pool of eligible applications for processing.
	
“今天宣布的艾伯塔省快速通道流程修改是我们政府将采取的众多步骤之一，以确保艾伯塔省获得所需的合格和熟练人才……”部长 Sawhney 在公告结束时说。	“The Alberta Express Entry stream modifications announced today is one of the many steps our government will be taking to ensure that Alberta gets the qualified and skilled talent that it needs…” said Minister Sawhney at the conclusion of the announcement.
