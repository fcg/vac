了解随移民申请提交翻译文件的重要性 IRCC 要求随移民申请提供的所有证明文件均以英语或法语提交。	Understanding the importance of submitting translated documents with an immigration application  IRCC requires that all supporting documents provided with an immigration application be submitted in English or French.
	
加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 要求为支持移民和公民身份申请而提交的所有外语文件必须附有英语或法语的官方翻译件。这些文件的翻译也必须由经过认证的官方翻译人员完成。	Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) requires that all foreign language documents submitted in support of applications for immigration and citizenship must be accompanied by an official translation in English or French. The translation of these documents must also be completed by a certified official translator.
	
未能正式翻译和认证其文件的申请人可能会被拒绝申请或被视为不完整。	An applicant who fails to have their documents officially translated and certified may have their application refused or be considered incomplete.
	
### Hasan Gorgulu 的案例	The Case of Hasan Gorgulu
	
Hasan Gorgulu 的案例是一个很好的例子，说明为什么在移民申请的同时确保外语文件翻译的完全准确和完整是很重要的。 Gorgulu 先生的案件于 2023 年 1 月提交联邦法院审理。土耳其公民 Gorgulu 向 IRCC 申请了遣返前风险评估 (PRRA)。 PRRA 是一个人可以提交的申请，如果他们被驱逐出加拿大并返回他们的国家将危及他们的生命或面临迫害或残忍惩罚的风险。为了支持他的申请，他提供了三份用土耳其语写成的文件。然而，尽管他提供了这些文件的翻译成英文的副本，但它们并未经过认证。	The case of Hasan Gorgulu is a worthwhile example of why it is important to ensure full accuracy and completion of foreign language document translation alongside an immigration application. Mr. Gorgulu’s case was brought before Federal Courts in January 2023. Gorgulu, a citizen of Turkey, applied for a pre-removal risk assessment (PRRA) to IRCC. A PRRA is an application a person may submit if they are being removed from Canada and going back to their country will put their life in danger or be at risk of persecution or cruel punishment. In support of his application, he provided three documents written in Turkish. However, although he provided copies of these documents translated to English, they were not certified.
	
Gorgulu 的申请因此被拒绝，因为 IRCC 官员表示英文文件没有正确认证，因此在他的申请中没有考虑。	Gorgulu’s application was therefore refused because the IRCC officer stated that the English documents were not correctly certified and were therefore not considered in his application.
	
戈尔古鲁申请对这一决定进行司法审查，称该官员对英文文件的处理不合理，拒绝其申请的决定也是如此。	Gorgulu applied for judicial review of this decision, stating that the officer’s treatment of the English documents was unreasonable, and so too was the decision to refuse his application.
	
### Hasan Gorgulu 案件的结果	The outcome of Hasan Gorgulu’s case
	
联邦法院概述了作为 PRRA 申请指南创建的指南 5523 规定，书面申请提交和任何支持文件必须以英语或法语提供。任何以非官方语言提交的文件都必须附有官方语言的翻译件，并附上翻译人员的声明。该指南还规定，仅以非官方语言提交的文件将不予考虑。	The Federal Court outlined that Guide 5523, created as a guide for PRRA applications states that written application submissions and any supporting documents must be provided in English or French. Any documents submitted in a non-official language must be accompanied by an official language translation, complete with a translator’s declaration. The Guide also states that documents submitted only in non-official languages will not be considered.
	
此外，联邦法院规定，不能要求 IRCC 人员理解以非官方语言编写的文件，因为如果文件不是英文或法文，IRCC 人员将无法评估文件中信息的价值。	Additionally, the federal court states that IRCC personnel cannot be required to understand documents written in non-official languages, because IRCC personnel will not be able to assess the value of the information in the document if it isn’t in English or French.
	
然而，法院还争辩说，Guide 5523 并未概述 IRCC 的任何法律要求。因此，不会阻止 PRRA 评估人员将文件问题告知申请人，从而为他们提供在做出决定之前纠正错误的机会。相反，将此类问题提请申请人注意是 IRCC 官员的自由裁量权。	However, the court also contends that Guide 5523 does not outline any legal requirements for IRCC. Consequently, PRRA-assessing officers are not prevented from telling applicants about issues with their documents, thereby providing them with an opportunity to fix the mistake before a decision is made. Instead, bringing an issue of this sort to the attention of an applicant is within the IRCC officer’s discretion.
	
因此，联邦法院得出结论认为，该官员不将错误告知 Gorgulu 的决定是不合理的。一个通情达理的官员会得出这样的结论：这个文件翻译问题很可能是由于翻译人员或提交文件的律师的疏忽造成的。此外，PRRA申请人的利害关系非常大，决定对申请人的权益产生重大影响。因此，该官员的决定没有考虑决定的后果和利害攸关的事情。	Accordingly, the federal court concluded that the officer’s decision not to bring the mistake to Gorgulu’s attention was unreasonable. A reasonable officer would have concluded that this document translation issue was likely due to an oversight on the part of the translator or the lawyer who submitted the documents. In addition, the stakes for a PRRA applicant are very high, and the decision had a significant impact on the applicant’s rights and interests. Therefore, the officer’s decision failed to consider the consequences of the decision and what was at stake.
