尊敬的先生/女士，	Dear Sir/Madam,
	
我写这封信是为了解释我在加拿大移民申请中工作经历的差距。从 \[月/年\] 到 \[月/年\]，我从我的前雇主那里请假去照顾生病的家人。这段时间，我没有积极找工作，因此没有任何收入。我附上了我家庭成员的医生的文件来支持这一解释。	I am writing this letter to provide an explanation for the gap in my employment history on my Canadian immigration application. From \[month/year\] to \[month/year\], I took a leave of absence from my previous employer to care for a family member who was ill. During this time, I was not actively seeking employment and therefore, did not have any income. I have attached documentation from my family member’s medical practitioner to support this explanation.
	
我向您保证，我将全力寻找工作并为加拿大经济做出贡献。我已经重返工作岗位，目前以\[你当前的职位\]的身份受雇于\[你当前的雇主\]。我也一直在积极寻找加拿大的就业机会，并收到了\[公司名称\]的工作机会，名称为\[职位名称\]，一旦我获得签证，我将接受这份工作。	I assure you that I am fully committed to finding employment and contributing to the Canadian economy. I have since returned to the workforce and am currently employed as \[your current job title\] with \[your current employer\]. I have also been actively seeking employment opportunities in Canada and have received a job offer from \[company name\] as \[Job Title\] which I will take up once I get my visa.
	
感谢您考虑我的解释。我很乐意提供可能需要的任何其他信息或说明。	Thank you for considering my explanation. I would be happy to provide any additional information or clarification that may be required.
	
此致 \[您的签名\] \[您的名字\]	Sincerely, \[Your Signature\] \[Your Name\]
