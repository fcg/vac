盖洛普：加拿大是 2021 年第二大最受欢迎的移民目的地	Gallup: Canada polls as second most popular destination for immigrants in 2021

* * *	* *

自 2018 年以来，全球分析和咨询公司盖洛普 (Gallup) 首次发布了一项民意调查数据，询问移民他们的首选移民目的地。	For the first time since 2018, global analytics and advice firm Gallup has released data on a poll asking immigrants about their preferred migration destinations.
	
这项于 1 月底首次发布的民意调查结果表明，全球近 9 亿人表示希望在 2021 年永久移民到另一个国家。	The results of this poll, which were first released near the end of January, suggest that nearly 900 million people around the world expressed a desire to migrate permanently to another country in 2021.  
	
据报道，2011 年至 2021 年期间，总移民意愿跃升了 4%——从 12% 到 16%——“这是自 12 年前 \[Gallup\] 开始收集数据以来的最高百分比记录”。	Reporting a four percent jump in total migration desire between 2011 and 2021 - from 12% to 16% - "this is the highest percentage recorded since \[Gallup\] began collecting data" 12 years ago.
	
随着时间的推移，根据盖洛普的数据，加拿大已成为一个越来越受欢迎的移民目的地，在该民意调查的近 127,000 名受访者（来自全球 122 个国家/地区）中，有 8% 的人表示他们希望移民到加拿大而不是美国 (U.S.)。	Over time, Canada has become an increasingly popular immigration destination according to Gallup's numbers, with 8% of the poll's nearly 127,000 respondents (across 122 countries worldwide) suggesting that they would like to immigrate to Canada instead of the United States (U.S). 
	
尽管美国仍然是最受欢迎的移民目的地，但自 2015-2016 年以来，该国的受欢迎程度下降了 4%，从 22% 下降到 18%。在同一时间段内，加拿大在移民中的受欢迎程度从百分之五上升到百分之八。	Although the U.S. continues to be the most popular destination for immigrants, the country's popularity has dipped by four percent - from 22% to 18% - since 2015-2016. Over the same timeframe, Canada's popularity amongst immigrants has risen from five to eight percent. 
	
这一跃升足以使加拿大在盖洛普的首选移民目的地名单中名列第二，仅次于美国，但领先于德国等国家 (7%)；西班牙、法国、澳大利亚和英国（均为 4%）和日本（3%）。	This jump has been enough to place Canada second on Gallup's list of preferred immigrant destinations, where it sits behind the U.S. but in front of countries such as Germany (7%); Spain, France, Australia and the United Kingdom (all at 4%) and Japan (3%).
	
**这是什么意思？**	**What does this mean?**
	
这项民意调查结果对加拿大来说是一个积极的结果，这一结果很可能受到该国广为宣传的移民愿望的影响 - 正如加拿大的高移民目标所证明的那样。	This poll result is a positive one for Canada, a result that may very well have been influenced by the country's well-publicized desire for immigration - as evidenced by Canada's high immigration targets. 
	
加拿大需要移民来抵消自然人口老龄化和低出生率的影响，这将有助于解决全国面临的长期劳动力短缺问题。由于加拿大的目标是在未来三年每年欢迎超过 465,000 名新永久居民来到加拿大，这种全球受欢迎程度的提高应该有助于加拿大实现这一目标，使该国更接近其寻求的社会和经济繁荣水平实现。	Canada requires immigration to offset an aging natural population and a low birth rate, which will help combat the chronic labour shortages being faced across the country. As Canada aims to welcome more than 465,000 new permanent residents to Canada in each of the next three years, this increased global popularity should aid Canada in reaching this goal, allowing the country to move closer to the level of social and economic prosperity that it seeks to achieve.
