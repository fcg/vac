加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 要求寻求加拿大移民途径，尤其是快速通道途径的申请人提交教育证书评估 (ECA)。	Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) requires applicants who are pursuing Canadian immigration pathways, the Express Entry pathway in particular, to submit an Educational Credential Assessment (ECA).
	
加拿大准移民提交的每份 ECA 均由 IRCC 审查，以评估在其他国家/地区获得的教育证书（学位、文凭、证书等）的等效性，并将其与加拿大标准进行比较。	Every ECA submitted by a prospective Canadian immigrant is reviewed by IRCC to assess the equivalency of educational credentials (degrees, diplomas, certificates, and so on) earned in other countries, and to compare them to Canadian standards.
	
世界教育服务 (WES) 是 IRCC 指定的五个组织之一，为在国外获得的学位和文凭提供 ECA（不包括医生和药剂师的 ECA）。	World Education Services (WES) is one of five organizations designated by IRCC to provide ECAs (not including ECAs for doctors and pharmacists) for degrees and diplomas earned abroad.
	
**注意：** WES 不评估职业或贸易资格。有关 IRCC 移民计划的更多信息，我们建议申请人访问 IRCC 的网站。	**Note:** WES does not evaluate occupational or trade qualifications. For more information about IRCC immigration programs, we advise applicants to visit IRCC’s website.

**3) 我可以评估我的所有证书并将其包含在 ECA 报告中吗？ **	**3) Can I have all my credentials evaluated and included in an ECA report? **
	
ECA 通常只评估申请人获得的最高国际学术证书。希望评估其所有学历的申请人可以在提交 ECA 申请后向 WES 提出此类请求。	ECAs typically only evaluate an applicant’s highest earned international academic credential. An applicant who would like to have all their academic credentials evaluated can make such a request to WES after they submit their ECA application.
	
尽管 ECA 申请者通常只需要提交他们获得的最高证书以供评估，但此要求也有一些例外情况。有关这些例外情况的更多详细信息和有关 ECA 的其他新信息，请参阅此博客文章：加拿大教育证书评估 (ECA) 的新要求。	Although ECA applicants typically only need to submit their highest earned credential for evaluation, there are some exceptions to this requirement. More details regarding these exceptions and other new information about ECAs can be found in this blog post: New Requirements for Canada’s Educational Credential Assessment (ECA).
	
**4) 我可以在我的 ECA 申请中添加另一个收件人吗？ **	**4) Can I add another recipient to my ECA application? **
	
是的。 WES 申请人可以通过他们的 WES 账户提出此请求。申请人可以在初始证书评估申请期间或之后选择省提名计划 (PNP) 办公室、某些移民律师或持牌移民顾问作为其 ECA 的接受者。	Yes. WES applicants can make this request through their WES Account. Applicants can select Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) offices, certain immigration lawyers, or licensed immigration consultants as recipients of their ECA either during the initial credential evaluation application or later.
	
**5) 我可以将我的 ECA 报告发送给美国收件人或机构吗？ **	**5) Can I send my ECA report to a U.S. recipient or institution? **
	
不会。WES 只会将申请人的 ECA 发送给 IRCC、加拿大各地的 PNP 办公室、某些移民律师事务所和持牌移民顾问。	No. WES only sends an applicant’s ECA to IRCC, PNP offices across Canada, certain immigration law firms, and licensed immigration consultants.
	
**6) 我可以将我的标准（非 ECA）评估报告发送给 IRCC 吗？ **	**6) Can I send my standard (non-ECA) evaluation report to IRCC? **
	
是的。申请人可以通过他们的 WES 账户提出此请求。	Yes. Applicants can make this request through their WES Account.

**7) 我如何为 IRCC 更新过期的 ECA 报告？ **	**7) How can I renew my expired ECA report for IRCC? **
	
WES 的初始 ECA 自签发之日起有效期为五年。要延长 WES ECA 的有效期，申请人可以登录其在线 WES 帐户并为 IRCC 订购额外的 ECA 副本。这会将申请人的 ECA 的有效期再延长五年。	An initial ECA from WES is valid for five years from the date of issue. To extend the validity of a WES ECA, applicants can sign into their online WES account and order an additional copy of the ECA for IRCC. This will extend the validity of the applicant’s ECA for an additional five years.
	
**8) 我是否需要将我的 ECA 升级为 WES 标准评估报告？ **	**8) Will I ever need to upgrade my ECA to a WES standard evaluation report? **
	
WES 可以帮助移民加拿大的申请人在需要时升级他们的 ECA。 ECA 明确指出该报告仅用于移民目的。但是，有时加拿大的雇主、学院、大学和专业许可机构需要 ECA 中未包含的信息。	WES can help applicants immigrating to Canada upgrade their ECA when needed. ECAs clearly state that the report is to be used for immigration purposes only. However, there may come a time when employers, colleges, universities, and professional licensing bodies in Canada require information that is not included in an ECA.
	
WES Course-by-Course (CxC) 或 Document-by-Document (DxD) 评估报告可以满足此要求。阅读这篇博文，了解有关 CxC 和 DxD 报告以及如何升级 ECA 的更多信息。	A WES Course-by-Course (CxC) or Document-by-Document (DxD) evaluation report can fulfill this requirement. Read this blog post to learn more about CxC and DxD reports and how you can upgrade an ECA.
