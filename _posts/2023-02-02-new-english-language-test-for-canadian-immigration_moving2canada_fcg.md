加拿大批准了一项新的英语语言能力测试。	Canada has approved a new English language proficiency test.
	
Pearson’s Test for English (PTE) Essential 将成为加拿大移民申请人证明其英语技能的第三种选择，与雅思和 CELPIP 并驾齐驱。	Pearson’s Test for English (PTE) Essential will be a third option for Canadian immigration applicants to demonstrate their English skills, alongside IELTS and CELPIP.
	
加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 和培生集团都表示，这一变化将于 2023 年底生效，但没有具体日期。	Both Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) and Pearson say the change will come into effect in late 2023, but no specific date is available.
	
根据 Pearson 的媒体发布，PTE Essential 与其同类产品 PTE Academic 相比，“更注重职业、现实生活和非学术，满足 IRCC 的语言能力要求”，后者面向学生。	According to Pearson’s media release, the PTE Essential has a “more vocational, real-life and non-academic focus that meets IRCC’s language proficiency requirements” in contrast to it’s similar product, the PTE Academic, which is geared towards students.
	
媒体联络员 Jennifer Bell 告诉 Moving2Canada，培生与加拿大政府合作确保测试包含人们实际使用的语言。她还表示，该语言将面向加拿大市场，而不是英国或澳大利亚风格的英语。	Jennifer Bell, a media liaison, told Moving2Canada that Pearson worked with the Canadian government to ensure that the test contained language that people would actually be using. She also said the language would be geared toward a Canadian market as opposed to British or Australian-style English.
	
“这是更多现实生活中的例子，而且措辞的水平适合以英语为第二语言的人。它并不太高，”贝尔说。	“It’s more real-life examples and the kind of wording is at a level that would be appropriate for people who have English as a second language. It’s not too elevated,” Bell said.
	
PTE Essential 将通过 Pearson 现有网络提供，该网络在 118 个国家/地区拥有 400 多个 PTE 中心。在加拿大，目前有八个 Pearson 考试中心：本拿比、卡尔加里、埃德蒙顿、蒙特利尔、渥太华和多伦多三个。预计将推出更多。	PTE Essential will be offered across Pearson’s existing network, with more than 400 PTE centres in 118 countries. In Canada, there are currently eight Pearson testing centres: Burnaby, Calgary, Edmonton, Montreal, Ottawa, and three in Toronto. More are expected to be rolled out.
	
考生将前往 Pearson 中心参加考试，考试由 Person VUE 提供，这是一个使用 AI 评分考试的程序。在向应试者提供最终分数之前，AI 评分由人工审核，它帮助 Pearson 在不到 48 小时内提供结果。	Test takers will go to a Pearson centre to take the test, which is delivered by Person VUE, a program that uses AI to mark tests. The AI marking is reviewed by a human before final scores are administered to the test takers, and it helps Pearson deliver results in less than 48 hours.
	
新闻稿称，培生还在中心收集生物特征数据，并在考试的口语部分使用语音识别软件，以确保应试者的完整性并提供公正准确的考试。	Pearson also collects biometric data at the centres and uses voice recognition software for the speaking portion of the test to ensure the integrity of the test taker and provide an impartial and accurate test, the release says.
	
PTE Essential 考生最多可提前 24 小时在线预约。考试中心名额全年可在全球范围内使用。可在 1.3 天内检索结果。	PTE Essential test takers can book online up to 24 hours in advance. Test centre slots are available year-round world-wide. Results can be retrieved within 1.3 days.
	
Pearson 的另一产品 PTE Academic 已经被加拿大、澳大利亚、爱尔兰、新西兰和英国 90% 以上的大学所接受。它也适用于所有前往英国、澳大利亚和新西兰的签证申请。然而，PTE Academic Online 不被接受用于工作和移民目的。鉴于 PTE Essentials 不能用于学术目的。	Another Pearson product, the PTE Academic, is already accepted at more than 90 percent of universities in Canada as well as Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, and the UK. It is also accepted for all visa applications to the UK, Australia, and New Zealand. PTE Academic Online, however, is not accepted for work and migration purposes. Whereas, the PTE Essentials cannot be used for academic purposes.
	
“我们已经看到 PTE Academic 如何帮助人们在他们选择工作或学习的任何国家迈出一大步，使他们能够说英语，”Pearson 首席执行官 Andy Bird 在新闻稿中说。 “我很高兴 PTE Essential 现在在加拿大被接受用于经济签证，并为我们的考试为考生提供的快速和高质量体验背后的创新和严谨感到自豪。”	“We’ve already seen how PTE Academic can help people take a huge stride towards being themselves in English in whichever country they choose to work or study,” said Andy Bird, CEO, Pearson, in the release. “I’m delighted PTE Essential is now accepted in Canada for economic visas and proud of the innovation and rigor that sits behind the quick and high-quality experience our test provides to test takers.”
	
随着 IRCC 今年努力接纳 465,000 名新永久居民，作为未来三年接纳 145 万名新永久居民的更大努力的一部分，IRCC 宣布了新的测试提供者。这些新移民中的大多数可能是通过需要语言测试的经济舱课程来的。虽然加拿大移民都接受英语和法语水平测试，但对英语测试的需求更大。	The announcement of a new test provider comes as IRCC works to admit 465,000 new permanent residents this year as part of a larger effort to welcome 1.45 million over the next three years. The majority of these newcomers are likely coming through economic-class programs that require a language test. Although both English and French proficiency tests are accepted for Canadian immigration, there is more demand for English tests.
