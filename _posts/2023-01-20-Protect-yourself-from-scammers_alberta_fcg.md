艾伯塔省政府已收到有关短信试图欺骗毫无戒心的艾伯塔人的报告，其中包括可能有资格获得定向救济金的老年人和家庭。在一个诈骗文本中，人们被要求点击一个链接来注册自动银行付款。Alberta’s government has received reports of text messages attempting to defraud unsuspecting Albertans, including seniors and families who may be eligible for targeted relief payments. In one scam text, people are asked to click on a link to register for automatic bank payments.

艾伯塔省政府绝不会向您发送短信或主动致电询问您的个人信息。The Government of Alberta will never text you or make unsolicited calls to ask you for your personal information.

政府于 1 月 18 日启动了一个安全的支付能力支付在线申请门户。家庭收入低于 180,000 美元的家庭有资格为每个 18 岁以下的受抚养子女每月领取 100 美元，为期六个月。家庭收入在 65 岁或以上的老年人低于 $180,000 且未领取 Alberta Seniors Benefit 也可以申请按月付款。A secure, online application portal for affordability payments was launched by the government on Jan. 18. Families with household incomes below $180,000 are eligible to receive $100 per month for six months for each dependent child under 18. Seniors 65 or older who have household incomes below $180,000 and do not receive the Alberta Seniors Benefit can also apply for monthly payments.

无法在线申请的任何人都可以通过任何注册代理或艾伯塔省支持中心亲自申请。Anyone who cannot apply online can apply in person through any registry agent or Alberta Supports Centre.

通过严重残障人士保障收入 (AISH)、收入支持或艾伯塔老年人福利金或通过发育障碍人士 (PDD) 计划获得服务的艾伯塔人已经注册该计划并将自动收到付款。Albertans who receive benefits through Assured Income for the Severely Handicapped (AISH), Income Support or the Alberta Seniors Benefit, or services through the Persons with Developmental Disabilities (PDD) program, are already registered for the program and will automatically receive payments.
