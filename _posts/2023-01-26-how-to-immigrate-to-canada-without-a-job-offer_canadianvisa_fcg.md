在没有工作机会的情况下移民加拿大的第一步是确定您是否有资格参加对没有工作机会的人开放的移民计划。为此，您必须满足该计划的要求，例如拥有能够成功融入加拿大工作场所的必要资格和技能，并证明您在过渡期间能够在经济上支持自己。此外，您必须满足其中一项对没有工作机会的人开放的移民计划的标准。	The first step to immigrating to Canada without a job offer is to determine your eligibility for one of the immigration programs that are open to those without a job offer. To do this, you must meet the requirements of the program, such as having the necessary qualifications and skills to be able to successfully integrate into the Canadian workplace and demonstrating that you are able to financially support yourself during the transition period. Additionally, you must meet the criteria of one of the immigration programs which is open to those without a job offer.

### 第 3 步：准备申请	Step 3: Prepare an Application
	
一旦您收集了必要的文件和信息，您就必须准备一份申请。申请通常涉及填写详细的调查问卷并提交相关文件。根据计划和个人情况，可能需要额外的步骤。	Once you have gathered the necessary documentation and information, you must then prepare an application.

没有工作移居加拿大的最佳方式	The Best Ways to Move to Canada Without a Job
		
您可以通过多种方式在没有工作机会的情况下实现移居加拿大的梦想	There are various ways you can achieve your dream of moving to Canada without having a job offer  
	
### 快速通道系统	Express Entry System
	
如果您想在加拿大生活，对于在加拿大寻求新生活的移民来说，快速通道是获得永久居留权的最快和最受欢迎的途径。该系统由加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 发起，并通过联邦经济移民计划选择移民加拿大的申请人。这些程序是：	If you want to live in Canada, Express Entry is the fastest and most popular pathway to permanent residence for immigrants seeking a new life in Canada. This system was started by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) and selects applicants for immigration to Canada through Federal Economic Immigration programs. These programs are:
	
**联邦技术工人计划 (FSWP)**	**Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP)**
	
截至 2015 年，FSWP 属于快速通道系统。 Express Entry 系统的主要目的是协助加快合格的外国技术工人 PR 签证到加拿大的流程。这是为了满足加拿大工业的劳动力需求并填补市场空白。这是在加拿大工作的好方法。	As of 2015, the FSWP falls under the Express Entry system. The main aim of the Express Entry system is to assist with speeding up the process for qualified skilled foreign workers PR Visa to Canada. This is so that they meet the labour needs of Canadian industries and fill the gaps in the market. This is a great way to work in Canada.
	
**联邦技术贸易计划 (FSTP)**	**Federal Skilled Trades Program (FSTP)**
	
引入 FSTP 是为了帮助具有足够工作经验和加拿大工作机会的熟练技工。该计划帮助商人找到在加拿大永久工作和生活的途径。	The FSTP has been introduced to aid skilled tradespeople with enough work experience and a canadian job offer. This program helps tradesmen find pathways to working and living in Canada permanently.
	
**加拿大经验类 (CEC)**	**Canadian Experience Class (CEC)**
	
CEC致力于协助在加拿大生活和工作至少一年并希望永久移民加拿大的合格技术移民。	The CEC is committed to assisting qualified skilled immigrants who have lived and worked in Canada for at least a year and want to immigrate to Canada permanently.
	
### 省提名项目	Provincial Nominee Programs
	
加拿大的每个省份都有独特的劳动力需求，这取决于哪些行业更为普遍，例如，IT 行业在不列颠哥伦比亚省和安大略省蓬勃发展，在那里，作为卡车司机，您将获得永久居留权。再次假设您符合条件。虽然每个省都有不同名称的不同流，但在节目类型中有一个共同点：	Every province in Canada has unique labour demands that depend on which industries are more prevalent, for example, the IT industry is booming in British Columbia and in Ontario, where you will be handed permanent residency on a silver platter as a truck driver. Once again, assuming you are eligible. While each province has different streams with different names, there is a common thread in the program types:
	
	  
	
| PNP 类别 |	| PNP Categories |
| --- |	| --- |
| **类别** | **说明** |	| **Category** | **Description** |
|需求/关键影响类别 |这些迎合了各省严重的劳动力短缺，从护士到农场工人，每个省都会有所不同|	| In-demand/critical impact categories | these cater to severe labour shortages in provinces, from nurses to farmworkers, each province will differ |
|技术工人类别 |与快速入境计划非常相似，这些计划适用于在其职业中具有丰富经验或资格的人。 |	| Skilled worker categories | much like in the express entry program, these are for people with significant experience or qualifications in their occupations. |
|国际研究生类别 |如果您打算继续在该省生活和工作，在加拿大的高等教育机构和您就读的省份学习将促使您申请成为永久居民。 |	| International Graduate categories | study at a Canadian post-secondary institution and the province you study in will motivate your application to become a permanent resident, granted you intend to continue living and working in that province. |
	
	  
	
每个 PNP 也至少有一个与联邦快速通道移民系统相连的移民流。这很完美，因为您可以选择哪个省份更适合您在加拿大生活。	Each PNP also has a minimum of one immigration stream that’s connected to the federal Express Entry immigration system. It’s perfect because you can choose which province would better suit you to live in Canada.

关于如何获得工作机会的 5 个重要提示	5 Top Tips on How to Get a Job Offer
		
### 确保您的 CV/Résumé 是最新的	Make sure your CV/ Résumé is up-to-date
	
你的简历是你的第一印象，如果你想在加拿大获得梦想工作的面试机会，它是极其重要的。确保您的简历中列出了与您申请的职位相关的以前的工作推荐信。这些参考资料应该是可联系的，并且最好仍在您以前的工作中使用。报名参加我们的评估，我们将帮助您策划一份独特的加拿大简历，供您用来打动加拿大雇主。	Your résumé is your first impression and is extremely important if you want to land an interview for your dream job in Canada. Make sure that you have previous employment references listed on your CV that are relevant to the position you are applying for. These references should be contactable and preferably still employed at your previous employment. Sign up for our assessment and we’ll help you curate a unique Canadian CV for you to use to impress Canadian employers.
	
### 有选择性	Be Selective
	
尽管在加拿大可能有很多令人惊叹的工作机会，听起来它们可能只适合您，但不要申请所有这些，无论它们多么诱人。事实上，它可能会产生与您希望的相反的效果。大多数招聘人员会在几个月内寻找合适的申请人，如果你的申请不断出现，他们可能会避开你。警惕工作机会诈骗并知道要注意什么。最后，请记住，如果您正在寻找永久居留权，您将需要至少一年的加拿大工作机会。	As much as there may be lots of amazing job opportunities in Canada that sound like they may just be for you, do not apply for all of them, no matter how tempting it may be. It may, in fact, have the opposite effect that you hope for. Most recruiters will search for the right applicant over a few months and if your application keeps popping up it may result in them steering clear of you. Be wary of job offer scams and know what to look out for. Finally, remember, if it's a permanent residency that you’re looking for you will need a canadian job offer for at least one year.
	
### 积极主动：跟进您的工作申请	Be proactive: Follow up on your job applications
	
一旦您将您的申请发送到有时有数百名申请人的池中，可以预料您的申请可能会在其他申请之间丢失。因此，除非另有规定，否则如果您没有收到有关特定职位列表的反馈，最好向雇主或招聘人员发送电子邮件以确保他们确实收到了。它不仅会让您高枕无忧，而且表明您对申请加拿大工作的态度是认真的。	Once you send your application into a pool of, sometimes, hundreds of applicants, it can be expected that your application may get lost between other applications. So unless otherwise stipulated, if you haven't had feedback about a particular job listing, it’s more than okay to send the employer or recruiter an email to ensure that they have indeed received it. It will not only give you some peace of mind as well as show that you are serious about your application for a job in Canada.
	
### 开始联网	Start networking
	
是时候扬名立万了！您可以在各种专业活动中这样做，例如招聘会和职业活动。这里不仅是结识未来雇主的最佳场所，也是与您所在行业的其他专业人士建立新联系的最佳场所。每年在加拿大和国外以及网上都会为那些认真想在加拿大申请工作的人举办各种活动。	It’s time to get your name out and even the playing fields! You can do this at various professional events such as job fairs and career events. This is the best place to not only meet prospective employers but also to make new connections with other professionals in your industry. There are various events held each year, both in Canada and abroad as well as online, for those who seriously want to apply for a job in Canada.
	
### 评估你的资格	Assess your qualifications
	
大多数加拿大工作都要求您对自己的资格或证书进行评估。这是为了确保您的技能符合加拿大标准。	Most canadian jobs require that you have your qualifications or credentials assessed. This is to ensure that your skills meet Canadian standards.
	
虽然一些加拿大工作，例如教学、医疗和社会工作专业的工作，不需要教育证书评估 (ECA)，但他们需要监管培训和考试。	Although some canadian jobs, such as those in the teaching, medical, and social work professions, will not need an Educational Credential Assessment (ECA) they will need regulatory training and examinations.
	
虽然在没有工作机会的情况下搬到加拿大可能具有挑战性，但这并非不可能。有几个项目可以让个人搬家并获得永久居留权。但是，重要的是要记住，为了成功申请，必须满足某些标准和要求。因此，建议研究不同的项目及其相关要求，以确定最适合个人的选择。这样做将有助于确保采取必要的步骤，个人将有更好的机会实现在加拿大生活和工作的梦想。	While moving to Canada without a job offer can be challenging, it is not impossible. There are several programs available that allow individuals to make the move and secure permanent residence. However, it is important to remember that there are certain criteria and requirements that must be met in order for a successful application. It is therefore recommended to research the different programs and their related requirements in order to determine the best option for the individual. Doing so will help ensure that the necessary steps are taken and the individual will have a better chance of achieving their dream of living and working in Canada.
