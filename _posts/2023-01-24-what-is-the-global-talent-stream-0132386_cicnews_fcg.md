什么是全球人才流？全球人才流帮助加拿大雇主加快招聘外国科技人才。	What is the Global Talent Stream? The Global Talent Stream helps Canadian employers expedite the hiring foreign tech talent.
	
全球人才流是加拿大临时外国工人计划 (TFWP) 的一部分，该计划旨在在劳动力和技能短缺且没有加拿大人或永久居民可以填补职位空缺时使用。	The Global Talent stream is part of Canada’s Temporary Foreign Worker Program (TFWP), which is intended to be used when there are labour and skill shortages and there are no Canadians or permanent residents available to fill positions.
	
全球人才流帮助加拿大的创新公司获得高技能的全球人才。该流程专为指定推荐合作伙伴推荐给加拿大就业和社会发展部并且需要熟练和专业的外国人才能发展的公司而设计。它也适用于需要填补全球人才职业清单上有需求的高技能职位的公司。	The Global Talent stream helps innovative firms in Canada access highly skilled global talent. The stream is designed for firms that are referred to Employment and Social Development Canada by a designated referral partner and that are in need of skilled and specialized foreign nationals in order to grow. It is also for firms that need to fill an in demand, highly skilled position on the Global Talent Occupations List.
	
全球人才流是一个两步过程。首先，雇主提交一份劳动力市场影响评估 (LMIA) 申请，证明如果雇主雇用外籍人士，将对加拿大劳动力市场产生积极或中性的影响。加拿大就业和社会发展部 (ESDC) 的目标是在 10 个工作日内处理全球人才流申请。一旦处理了此申请，外籍工人就可以申请工作许可证。	The Global Talent stream is a two-step process. First, employers submit a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) application that demonstrates that there will be a positive or neutral effect on the Canadian labor market if the employer hires the foreign national. Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) aims to process Global Talent Stream applications within 10 business days. Once this application is processed, the foreign worker can apply for a work permit.
	
全球人才流下有两个类别	There are two categories under the Global Talent Stream
	
* A类	  Category A
* B类	  Category B
	
### A类	Category A
	
该类别专为指定推荐合作伙伴推荐给加拿大就业和社会发展部的公司设计，这些公司需要专门的外籍人士来填补需求职位。	The category is designed for companies that are referred to Employment and Social Development Canada by a designated referral partners, and who need specialized foreign nationals to fill an in-demand position.
	
可以在此处找到为魁北克以外的雇主设计的推荐合作伙伴列表。	The list of designed referral partners for employers outside Quebec can be found here.
	
### 乙类	Category B
	
此类别专为希望为全球人才职业清单上的职业雇用熟练外国工人的雇主而设计。这份名单上的职业在加拿大有需求，但缺乏足够的劳动力供应。	This category is designed for employers looking to hire skilled foreign workers for occupations on the Global Talent Occupations List. The occupations on this list are in demand in Canada are lacking sufficient labor supply.
	
**全球人才流的雇主要求是什么？**	**What are the employer requirements for the Global Talent Stream?**
	
这两类雇主都必须制定劳动力市场福利计划，该计划表明雇主致力于对加拿大劳动力市场产生持久和积极影响的活动。 A 类雇主必须承诺为加拿大公民和永久居民创造就业机会，而 B 类雇主必须承诺增加对加拿大公民和永久居民的技能和培训投资。	Employers in both categories must develop a Labour Market Benefits Plan, which demonstrates the employer’s commitment to activities that have lasting and positive impacts on the Canadian labor market. Category A employers are required to commit to creating jobs for Canadian citizens and permanent residents, while Category B employers are required to commit to increasing investments in skills and training for Canadian citizens and permanent residents.
	
此外，这两类雇主都必须承诺提供两项以上的补充福利，每项福利至少有一项活动。这些补充福利包括但不限于创造就业机会、合作或实习计划、培训现有员工掌握新技术或实施最佳实践或政策作为您的员工队伍的雇主。	In addition, employers in both categories must commit to two more complementary benefits, with at least one activity for each benefit. These complementary benefits can include, but are not limited to, creating jobs, co-op or internship programs, training current employees in new techniques or implementing best practices or policies as an employer for your workforce.
	
这两类雇主还必须满足与技术工人报酬相关的条件。通过全球人才流雇用的外国技术工人必须按现行工资或更高的工资支付。现行工资被定义为以下两者中的最高数字：	Employers in both categories must also meet conditions relating to the payment of skilled workers. Foreign skilled workers hired through the Global Talent Stream must be paid at the prevailing wage or higher. The prevailing wage is defined as the highest figure of either:
	
* 加拿大政府工作库中该职业的工资中位数；	  the median wage for the occupation on the Government of Canada’s job bank;
*雇主支付在同一地点、同一职位、具有相同技能和经验水平的现有雇员的工资范围内；	  the wage within the range an employer pays current employees in the same position at the same location, with the same skills and experience level;
* 全球人才职业列表中定义的最低工资标准（如适用）。	  the minimum wage floor as defined in the Global Talent occupations list (if applicable).
	
尽管全球人才流对希望填补劳动力和技能短缺的加拿大雇主有各种好处，但它也可以成为外国人获得加拿大工作经验的有效途径。加拿大工作经验对于希望最终申请永久居留权的外国公民来说非常有利。	Although the Global Talent Stream has various benefits for Canadian employers looking to fill labor and skill shortages, it can also be an effective way for foreign nationals to gain Canadian work experience. Canadian work experience can be extremely beneficial for foreign nationals who are looking to eventually apply for permanent residence.
