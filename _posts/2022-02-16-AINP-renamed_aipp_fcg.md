### 2022 年 2 月 16 日：AINP 更名	February 16, 2022: AINP renamed

2022 年 2 月 16 日，艾伯塔省移民提名计划 (AINP) 更名为艾伯塔省优势移民计划 (AAIP)。还推出了两个新的流——农村复兴流和农村企业家流。	On February 16, 2022, the Alberta Immigrant Nominee Program (AINP) was renamed to the Alberta Advantage Immigration Program (AAIP). Two new streams were also launched – the Rural Renewal Stream and the Rural Entrepreneur Stream.

对该程序进行了其他几项更改：	Several other changes were made to the program:

* 3 个企业家流的名称发生了变化：	The names of 3 entrepreneur streams changed:
* 国际研究生企业家移民流现在是研究生企业家流	* The International Graduate Entrepreneur Immigration Stream is now the Graduate Entrepreneur Stream
* 外国毕业生创业签证流现在是外国毕业生企业家流。	* The Foreign Graduate Start-Up Visa Stream is now the Foreign Graduate Entrepreneur Stream.
* 自雇农民流现在是农场流。	* The Self-Employed Farmer Stream is now the Farm Stream.
* 使用我们的在线门户提交申请并需要提名延期的候选人现在必须在门户中提交请求。	Candidates who submitted their application using our online portal and need a nomination extension must now submit the request in the portal.

现有流和路径的计划资格标准没有改变。所有其他决策后流程也保持不变。新节目和流名称将在未来几周内在门户中更新。	Program eligibility criteria did not change for existing streams and pathways. All other post-decision processes are also unchanged. The new program and stream names will be updated in the portal in the coming weeks.
