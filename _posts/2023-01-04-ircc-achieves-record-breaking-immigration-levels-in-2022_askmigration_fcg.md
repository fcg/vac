加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 在 2022 年处理了 480 万份申请，创历史新高。这比 2021 年同期处理的 250 万份申请有了显着增长。该部门有望在年底前接纳破纪录的 431,000 名永久居民进入加拿大。	Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) has achieved an all-time high in 2022 with the processing of 4.8 million applications. This is a significant increase from the 2.5 million applications processed in the same period in 2021. The department is on track to admit a record breaking 431,000 permanent residents to Canada by the end of the year.
	
**破纪录的移民水平**	**Record Breaking Immigration Levels**
	
IRCC处理的申请数量在今年达到了新的高峰，共有480万份申请。这些申请中的大部分属于临时居留类别，正在处理近 700,000 份工作许可和 670,000 份学习许可。今年 4 月至 11 月，加拿大还迎来了大约 251,000 名新公民。移民部长肖恩·弗雷泽 (Sean Fraser) 评论了这一进展，“我们的政府已将大流行病积压案件减少了近 50 万，同时今年处理的移民申请数量也创下了纪录。我们的行动确保我们能够继续欢迎和支持来加拿大工作、学习、访问或定居的新移民。正是通过移民系统管理人员的奉献和辛勤工作，以及我们现代化和适应的意愿，我们才能够维护加拿大作为一个热情和包容的国家的声誉。”	The number of applications processed by IRCC reaches a new peak this year with a total of 4.8 million applications. The majority of these applications are in the temporary residence category, with nearly 700,000 work permits and 670,000 study permits being processed. Canada has also welcomed approximately 251,000 new citizens between April and November of this year. Immigration Minister Sean Fraser commented on the progress, “Our government has reduced its pandemic backlogs by nearly half a million, while also processing a record-breaking number of immigration applications this year. Our actions are ensuring that we can continue to welcome and support newcomers who come to Canada to work, study, visit, or settle here. It is through the dedication and hard work of those who administer our immigration system, and our willingness to modernize and adapt, that we are able to uphold Canada’s reputation as a welcoming and inclusive country.”
	
**减少积压**	**Reducing the Backlog**
	
截至 2020 年 12 月 2 日，IRCC 库存中有 220 万份申请。其中，有 109 万份申请（即略高于 50%）被视为积压，或未按服务标准处理。这比 11 月 3 日的数据有了显着改善，当时库存中有 240 万份申请，比 9 月份的 260 万份大幅下降。 IRCC 已将永久居民卡更新申请的大流行积压减少了 99%。此外，该部门还实施了更改以纠正运营效率低下的问题，例如应用程序的数字化，公民身份申请对 18 岁以上的任何人都是 100% 数字化的。	As of December 2, 2020, IRCC had 2.2 million applications in inventory. Of these, 1.09 million applications, or just over 50%, are considered to be backlog, or not processed within service standards. This is a marked improvement on the November 3 data when there were 2.4 million applications in inventory, and is down significantly from 2.6 million in September. IRCC has reduced its pandemic backlog of applications for permanent resident card renewals by 99%. Additionally, the department has implemented changes to correct operational inefficiencies such as the digitization of applications, with citizenship applications being 100% digital for anyone over the age of 18.

**努力精简**	**Efforts to Streamline**
	
到年底，IRCC 还聘请了 1,250 名新员工，以帮助简化申请流程。此外，该部门已采取措施增加抵达加拿大的移民人数，例如将工作许可延长至临时外籍工人的配偶和工作年龄的受抚养人，以及取消国际学生每周 20 小时的工作上限。大西洋移民计划以及农村和北部移民试点项目也得到了扩展。	IRCC has also hired 1,250 new staff by the end of the year to help with streamlining application processing. Moreover, the department has implemented measures to increase the number of immigrants arriving in Canada, such as extending work permits to the spouses and working-age dependents of temporary foreign workers and lifting the 20 hours-per-week work cap for international students. There have also been expansions to the Atlantic Immigration Program and the Rural and Northern Immigration Pilot.
