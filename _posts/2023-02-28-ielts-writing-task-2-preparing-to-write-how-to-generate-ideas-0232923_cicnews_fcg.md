许多学生在计划要说的内容之前就开始写作。	Many students start writing before planning what they are going to say.
	
这可能会导致写作反应杂乱无章，并可能对他们的分数产生负面影响。在此博客中，我们将探讨如何提高您的写作技巧，并提出一些有效计划的想法，以便您为考试日做好准备。	This could lead to a writing response which is disorganized and could negatively affect their score. In this blog, we’ll look at how you can improve your writing skills and suggest some ideas for effective planning so that you are ready for test day.
	
阅读以下 Writing Task 2 问题和示例介绍。你认为作者已经完全理解了这个问题吗？	Read the following Writing Task 2 question and an example introduction. Do you think the writer has fully understood the question?
	
儿童肥胖的增加对健康构成了真正的威胁，现在越来越多的儿童被归类为超重。问题的原因是什么，可以采取什么措施来解决？	A rise in childhood obesity is a real threat to health with an increasing number of children now classified as overweight. What are the causes of the problem and what measures can be taken to solve them?
	
给出你的答案的理由，并包括你自己的经验知识中的任何相关例子。至少写 250 个字。	Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge of experience. Write at least 250 words.
	
实例介绍	Example introduction
	
_儿童肥胖有很多不利因素，包括对儿童身心健康的影响。超重儿童的生活质量与同龄人不同，需要大量支持。在我看来，儿童肥胖是一种消极的生活方式。_	_There are many disadvantages to childhood obesity, including effects on a child’s physical and mental health. Children who are overweight do not have the same quality of life as their peers and require a lot of support. In my opinion, childhood obesity is a negative way of living._ 
	
## **冲进写作**	**Rushing into writing**
	
看起来作者在开始写作之前没有花必要的时间阅读和理解问题，而是开始写错误类型的文章作为回应。这种类型的错误发生在雅思写作考试中，当考生对在 40 分钟内写出 250 个单词感到紧张时，可以理解，因此急于开始。然而，通过花时间全面分析问题，考生可以确保他们写的是正确的主题、正确的重点和正确的文章类型。	It looks like the writer has not spent the necessary time to read and understand the question before beginning to write, and has started to write the wrong type of essay as a response. This type of mistake happens in the IELTS Writing test when test takers are understandably nervous about writing 250 words in only 40 minutes so are in a rush to get started. However, by taking the time to fully analyse the question, test takers can ensure they write about the right topic, with the right focus, and the right type of essay.

这里有几个步骤可以确保您在开始写作之前已做好充分准备，并避免犯此类错误。	Here are a few steps to follow to make sure that you are fully prepared before you start writing and to avoid making this type of mistake.
	
## **第一步：分析问题**	**Step 1: Analyse the question**
	
在你开始写作之前，你需要花一些时间来回答这个问题。仔细阅读问题和说明并问自己以下问题：	Before you start writing, you need to spend some time with the question. Read the question and instructions carefully and ask yourself these questions:
	
- **我必须发表意见吗？**	-   **Do I have to give my opinion?**
- **我必须讨论争论的双方吗？**	-   **Do I have to discuss both sides of an argument?**
- **我必须回答任何问题吗？**	-   **Do I have to answer any questions?**
	
这将帮助您确定论文的类型。针对前面的示例 Writing Task 2 问题提出这些问题，并确定对您有帮助的关键词。	This will help you to identify the type of essay. Ask these questions about the previous example Writing Task 2 question and identify the key words that helped you.
	
一旦你确定了文章的类型，一定要确定文章的重点。你被要求在这个问题中讨论什么问题？你会强调或强调哪些关键词？	Once you’ve identified the type of essay, be sure to identify the focus of the essay. What problem is it that you’re being asked to discuss in this question? What key words would you underline or highlight?
	
如果你是做雅思纸笔的，你可以随意在试卷上写。如果你是在电脑上做雅思考试，你也可以在在线平台上做笔记和突出文本，或者使用你提供的废纸。您做的任何笔记都不会被评估，考官也不会看到您的粗略笔记。	If you are doing IELTS on paper, you are free to write on the question paper. If you are doing IELTS on computer, you can also take notes and highlight text in the online platform, or use the piece of scrap paper that you are provided with. Any notes that you take aren’t assessed, and the Examiner will not see your rough notes.
	
### **为什么我需要做粗略的笔记？**	**Why do I need to take rough notes?**
	
请记住，您只有 40 分钟的时间来撰写论文，这意味着您没有时间撰写初稿。相反，你可以计划你的想法，并用粗略的笔记准备你的论文大纲。你能写下的想法越多，无论多么粗略，你就需要写越多。此外，如果您提前准备好要写的内容，那么一旦您准备好开始，您就可以专注于您的写作方式。	Remember that you only have 40 minutes to write your essay so this means that you do not have time to write a first draft. Instead, you can plan your ideas and prepare an outline of your essay in rough notes. The more ideas you can put down, no matter how roughly, the more you’ll have to write about. Also, if you prepare what you’re going to write about in advance, you can focus on how you’re writing once you’re ready to start.
	
## **第 2 步：头脑风暴您的想法**	**Step 2: Brainstorm your ideas**
	
你如何写你的粗略笔记完全取决于你。你可能想用思维导图、项目符号或表格来写下你的笔记。无论你选择什么方法，花点时间尽可能多地记下想法或论点。	How you write your rough notes is entirely up to you. You might want to write your notes in a mind map or in bullet points or as a table. Whatever method you choose, take a few moments to jot down as many ideas or arguments as you can.
	
|原因 |解决方案 |	| Causes | Solutions |
| --- | --- |	| --- | --- |
| 1\。垃圾食品在学校的可用性 | 1\。学校禁止垃圾食品|	| 1\. Availability of junk food at school | 1\. Schools ban junk food |
| 2\.低成本的不健康食品与昂贵的健康食品 | 2\.政府开征糖税|	| 2\. Low cost of unhealthy food vs. expensive healthy food | 2\. Government introduce sugar tax |
| 3\.少运动，多看屏幕 | 3\.父母限制屏幕时间，增加户外时间 |	| 3\. Less exercise, more time in front of screens | 3\. Parents limit screen time, increase time outside |

### **考虑不同的观点**	**Consider alternative perspectives**
	
如果您正在努力想出主意，对于任何问题类型，请考虑您自己的替代观点。想一想对问题的主题感兴趣或受其影响的人的类别。对于上面的示例问题，您可以问自己有关孩子生活中那些人的个人角色和责任。将以下问题作为考试当天可能出现的各种主题和问题类型的指南：	If you are struggling to come up with ideas, for any question type, consider alternative perspectives to your own. Think of the categories of people who would be interested in or affected by the topic of the question. For the example question above, you could ask yourself about the individual roles and responsibilities of those involved in a child’s life. Think of the following questions as a guide for a variety of topics and question types that may come up on test day:
	
- **个人可以做什么？**	-   **What could the individual do?**
	
_例如。孩子们可以存下零花钱用于偶尔的款待_	_e.g. children could save pocket money for occasional treats_
	
- **父母可以在家做什么？**	-   **What could parents do at home?**
	
_例如。限制屏幕时间，增加户外时间_	_e.g. limit screen time, increase time outside_
	
- **学校能做什么？**	-   **What could schools do?**
	
_例如。校园内禁止垃圾食品_	_e.g. ban junk food on school premises_
	
- **公司和企业可以做什么？**	-   **What could companies and businesses do?**
	
_例如。赞助健康食品倡议_	_e.g. sponsor healthy food initiatives_
	
- **地方或国家政府可以做什么？**	-   **What could the local or national government do?**
	
_例如。糖税_	_e.g. sugar tax_
	
## **第 3 步：选择你最好的论点**	**Step 3: Choose your best arguments**
	
一旦你列出了所有的论点，所有你能想到的想法，你就可以选择两到三个来写在你的文章中。确保选择您知道可以写的要点。做出选择时请考虑以下问题：	Once you have a list of all the arguments, all the ideas you can think of, you can then choose two to three to write about in your essay. Make sure that you choose the points that you know you can write about. Consider these questions when making your choices:
	
- **您最能写下哪些想法？**	-   **Which of the ideas could you write most about?**
	
_请记住任务 2 中的说明，您必须根据自己的知识和经验来撰写。您不需要拥有任何专业知识或专长，但重要的是您选择您知道可以扩展的论点。_	_Remember the instructions in Task 2 state that you have to write from your own knowledge and experience. You are not expected to have any specialist knowledge or expertise, but it is important that you choose arguments that you know you could expand on._
	
- **你能想出每个想法的原因、例子和结果吗？**	-   **Can you think of reasons, examples, and results of each idea?**
	
_在您的思维导图/表格中的每个想法下记下您将在支持论点中使用的关键词。考虑为你的论点提供理由和例子，并概述任何可能的影响或影响。_	_Take a note under each idea in your mind map/table of the key words that you will use in your supporting arguments. Consider providing reasons and examples for your argument as well as outlining any possible impact or effects._
	
- **哪些想法彼此不同？**	-   **Which ideas are different from each other?**
	
_避免写非常相似的想法或论点。这将帮助您的段落有更清晰的中心主题并避免过多的语言重复。_	_Avoid writing about very similar ideas or arguments. This will help your paragraphs to have clearer central topics and avoid too much repetition of language._
	
- **你有没有选择想法来支持你的立场？**	-   **Have you chosen ideas to support your position?**
	
_In opinion or discussion essays you are explicitly instructions to provide your position,确保你选择的想法能为考官阐明你的立场。在问题和解决方案论文中，你的立场隐含在你对有效解决方案的选择和描述中。_	_In opinion or discussion essays you are explicitly instructed to provide your position, make sure that you choose ideas that clarify your position for the Examiner. In problem and solution essays, your position is implicit in your choice and description of effective solutions._
	
- **你选择了一个想法来平衡这篇文章吗？**	-   **Have you chosen an idea to balance the essay?**
	
_这在 opinion essays 中是可选的，但在 2-sidesdiscussion essays 中是必不可少的，你必须讨论论点的双方。在问题和解决方案论文中，当问题作为事实呈现时，你不需要争论问题是否存在。_	_This is optional in opinion essays but is essential in 2-sided discussion essays where you must discuss both sides of the argument. In problem and solution essays, you do not need to debate whether or not the problem exists when it is presented as fact._

### **所有这些规划是不是浪费了太多的写作时间？**	**Doesn’t all of this planning waste too much writing time?**
	
这些步骤只需两到三分钟即可完成，而且这段时间非常值得。反之，急于写作，写到一半才发现自己没有完全理解问题，没有足够的时间进行更正，那将是浪费时间。	These steps can be completed in just two to three minutes and this time is very well spent. Conversely, it would be a waste of time to rush into writing and realise halfway through that you have not fully understood the question, and don’t have enough time to make the corrections.
	
在准备雅思考试时，将计划作为考试实践的一部分。你这样做的次数越多，你的想法产生的速度就越快，你就越能准备好写出你在实际考试当天写过的最好的文章。	As you prepare for your IELTS test, make planning a part of your test practice. The more often you do this, the quicker your idea-generation will be, and the more prepared you’ll be to write the best essay you’ve ever written on your actual test day.
	
祝你好运！	Good luck!
