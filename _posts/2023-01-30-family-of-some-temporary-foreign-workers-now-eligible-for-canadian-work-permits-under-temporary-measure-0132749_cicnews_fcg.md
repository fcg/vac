从今天（1 月 30 日）开始，一些临时外国工人 (TFW) 的家庭成员将有资格获得工作许可。	Starting today, January 30, family members of some temporary foreign workers (TFWs) will be eligible for work permits.
	
移民部长肖恩·弗雷泽 (Sean Fraser) 表示，临时外国工人计划 (TFWP) 和国际流动计划 (IMP) 的主要申请人的家庭成员的工作许可证将暂时延长。这项措施将帮助加拿大解决长期劳动力短缺问题。	Immigration minister Sean Fraser said that temporarily extending work permits to family members of principal applicants in the temporary foreign worker program (TFWP) and International Mobility Program (IMP). This measure will help Canada combat chronic labour shortages.

* 他们是工作许可证持有人的配偶、普通法同居伴侣或受抚养子女：	  They are the spouse, common-law partner, or dependent child of a work permit holder who:
* 从事任何培训、教育、经验和责任 (TEER) 类别（0 至 5）的工作，或；	    *   works in a job of any Training, Education, Experience and Responsibilities (TEER) category (0 to 5), or;

### 新许可将使集成更容易	New permits will make it easier to integrate
	
在该措施今天生效之前，工作许可证仅适用于从事高技能职业的主要申请人的配偶和家庭成员。通过临时向 TFW 的配偶、受抚养人和普通法同居伴侣发放工作许可证，政府希望通过改善财务稳定性并使家庭更容易聚在一起并融入社区来减轻工人的一些压力。	Until the measure took effect today, work permits were only available to the spouses and family members of principal applicants in high-skilled occupations. By temporarily issuing work permits to the spouses, dependents, and common-law partners of TFWs, the government hopes to take some of the stress off workers by improving financial stability and making it easier for families to stay together and integrate into their communities.
	
2022 年 1 月至 2022 年 10 月，加拿大签发了超过 645,000 份工作许可证。这几乎是 2021 年同期发行的 163,000 份的四倍。	Between January and October 2022, Canada issued over 645,000 work permits. This is nearly four times more than the 163,000 issued over the same period in 2021.
	
该措施将持续两年，包括所有技能水平的主要申请人的 16 岁及以上的工作年龄儿童。这包括医疗保健、贸易和酒店业工人的家庭。据估计，该计划将使超过 20 万外国工人的家庭有可能进入加拿大的劳动力市场。	The measure will last for the next two years and includes working-age children, 16 and older, of principal applicants of all skill levels. This includes families of workers in healthcare, trades, and hospitality. It is estimated that this program will make it possible for the families of more than 200,000 foreign workers to enter Canada’s workforce.
	
这位部长去年 12 月在埃德蒙顿说：“无论我走到哪里，全国各地的雇主仍然认为缺乏工人是他们最大的障碍。” “今天的公告将通过将工作许可扩大到所有技能水平的家庭成员，帮助雇主找到他们需要的工人来填补他们的劳动力缺口，从而使超过 200,000 名外国工人的家庭成员能够在加拿大工作。我们的政府将继续帮助雇主克服劳动力短缺，同时支持工人的福祉和他们的家庭团聚。”	“Everywhere I go, employers across the country continue to identify a lack of workers as their biggest obstacle,” said the minister last December in Edmonton. “Today’s announcement will help employers find the workers they need to fill their labour gaps by expanding work permits to family members at all skill levels, resulting in family members of over 200,000 foreign workers being able to work in Canada. Our government is going to continue helping employers overcome labour shortages, while also supporting the well-being of workers and uniting their families.”
