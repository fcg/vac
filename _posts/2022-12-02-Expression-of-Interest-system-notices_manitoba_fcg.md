发表于 2022 年 12 月 2 日，曼尼托巴移民途径	Posted on December 2, 2022 by Manitoba Immigration Pathways

1. 所有有兴趣申请技术工人流的人都必须创建一份意向书 (EOI) 资料。	1.All persons who are interested in applying to the Skilled Worker Stream must create an Expression of Interest (EOI) profile.
2. 曼尼托巴省提名计划 (MPNP) 每年都会收到来自加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 的提名分配。 MPNP 邀请相应数量的申请提交，以通过 EOI 抽签使用整个提名分配。 MPNP 只能批准与给定年份的提名分配一样多的申请。	2.The Manitoba Provincial Nominee Program (MPNP) receives an allocation of nominations each year from Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC). The MPNP invites a corresponding number of applications to be submitted to utilize the entire nomination allocation through the EOI draws. The MPNP can only approve as many applications as the nomination allocation in a given year.
3. 到 2022 年，MPNP 可以批准 **6,367** 申请。	3.For 2022, the MPNP can approve **6,367** applications.
4. 2023年的提名分配尚未公布。	4.The nomination allocation for 2023 has not yet been announced.
5. MPNP 根据流的优先级和给定的 EOI 抽签时的最高排名点发布申请通知书 (LAA)。	5.The MPNP issues Letters of Advice to Apply (LAAs) based on priority by stream and the highest ranking points at the time of a given EOI draw.
6.曼尼托巴省意向书库中的个人资料数量超过年度提名分配。因此，并非所有创建 EOI 资料的人都会被选中接收 MPNP 的 LAA。	6.The number of profiles in Manitoba's EOI pool exceeds the annual nomination allocation. As a result, not everyone who creates an EOI profile will be selected to receive a LAA to the MPNP.
7. 个人可以通过完成或更新他们的语言测试结果、完成额外的工作经验或通过完成额外的教育来提高他们的分数。	7.Individuals can improve their score by completing or updating their language test results, completing additional work experience, or through completion of additional education.
8. 有兴趣移民到马尼托巴省的个人也可能有资格通过联邦移民计划提出申请。有关联邦移民计划的更多信息，请访问 IRCC 网站。	8.Individuals interested in immigrating to Manitoba may also be eligible to apply through a federal immigration program. More information on federal immigration programs can be found on the IRCC website.
