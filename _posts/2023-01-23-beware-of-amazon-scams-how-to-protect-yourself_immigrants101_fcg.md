虚假产品列表：	Fake Product Listings:
	
亚马逊最常见的骗局之一是虚假产品列表。这些是在亚马逊平台上宣传的假冒产品，但实际上无法购买。它们经常被用来诱骗购物者为他们永远不会收到的产品付款。为避免成为此骗局的受害者，您应该对价格不切实际的产品或来自很少或没有反馈或评论的卖家的产品持谨慎态度。	One of the most common Amazon scams is fake product listings. These are fake products that are advertised on the Amazon platform, but they are not actually available for purchase. They are often used to trick shoppers into paying for products that they will never receive. To avoid falling victim to this scam, you should be cautious of products with unrealistic prices or from sellers with little or no feedback or reviews.
	
网络钓鱼诈骗：	Phishing Scams:
	
网络钓鱼诈骗是亚马逊诈骗的另一种常见形式。这些是伪造的电子邮件或消息，看起来像是来自亚马逊，但实际上它们来自试图窃取您的个人信息的小偷。为避免成为此骗局的受害者，除非您确定电子邮件或消息来自亚马逊，否则切勿点击链接或输入您的个人信息。	Phishing scams are another common form of Amazon scam. These are fake emails or messages that are designed to look like they are from Amazon, but they are actually from thieves trying to steal your personal information. To avoid falling victim to this scam, you should never click on links or enter your personal information unless you are certain that the email or message is from Amazon.
	
未经授权的信用卡收费：	Unauthorized Credit Card Charges:
	
您应该注意的另一个骗局是未经授权的信用卡收费。当小偷使用您的信用卡信息在亚马逊上进行未经授权的购买时，就会发生这种情况。为避免成为此骗局的受害者，您应该密切关注您的信用卡对帐单，并立即向您的银行或亚马逊报告任何可疑费用。	Another scam you should be aware of is unauthorized credit card charges. This happens when a thief uses your credit card information to make unauthorized purchases on Amazon. To avoid falling victim to this scam, you should keep a close eye on your credit card statements and report any suspicious charges to your bank or Amazon immediately.
