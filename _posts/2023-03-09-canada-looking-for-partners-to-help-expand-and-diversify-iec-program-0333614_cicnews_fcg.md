# 加拿大寻找合作伙伴以帮助扩大 IEC 计划并使其多样化 IEC 正在寻找新的合作伙伴国家和组织，以增加参与者的数量并填补某些领域的空白。加拿大的劳动力	Canada looking for partners to help expand and diversify IEC program IEC is looking for new partner countries and organizations to increase the number of participants and fill gaps in some sectors. of Canada’s workforce
继最近宣布的加拿大国际经验 (IEC) 计划配额之后，CIC 新闻从 2022 年 9 月 26 日的加拿大移民难民和公民部 (IRCC) 内部备忘录中获得了有关 2023 年计划前景的更多信息。	Following the recently announced quotas for the International Experience Canada (IEC) program, CIC News has obtained more information on the 2023 program outlook from an internal Immigration Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) memo from September 26, 2022.
	
虽然移民部长肖恩·弗雷泽 (Sean Fraser) 去年 1 月宣布，2023 年全球 IEC 入学配额已上升至近 90,000 名参与者，但该备忘录提供了有关 IRCC 如何做出这一决定的更多信息。	While immigration minister Sean Fraser announced last January that the global quotas for IEC admissions in 2023 have risen to nearly 90,000 participants, the memo provides more information about how IRCC made this decision.
	
### 什么是IEC？	What is the IEC?
	
IEC 是一项专门针对 18 至 35 岁（取决于他们的国籍）的年轻人的计划，他们可以选择资助他们的旅行并通过工作来体验加拿大作为当地人的旅行。	The IEC is a program specifically for youth anywhere from 18 to 35 years old (depending on their nationality) to come and explore Canada with the option to fund their travels, and experience Canada as a local, by working.

IEC 与参与国家和组织一起管理青年流动安排 (YMA)。截至备忘录发送时，加拿大与欧洲、大洋洲、东亚和美洲的 36 个国家和地区合作伙伴建立了 YMA。	The IEC manages Youth Mobility Arrangements (YMAs) with participating countries and organizations. As of the time the memo was sent, Canada has YMAs with 36 country and territory partners across Europe, Oceania, East Asia and the Americas.
	
### 全球配额增加，而合作伙伴配额保持在 2022 年的水平	Global quota rises while partner quota stays at 2022 levels
	
2022 年 IEC 入学人数未达到大流行前水平。 IRCC 表示，这是由几个因素造成的，包括更高的旅行成本、健康风险导致的犹豫以及伙伴国家严重的劳动力短缺。	The 2022 number of IEC admissions were not up to pre-pandemic levels. IRCC says this is due to several factors, including higher travel costs, hesitancy due to health risks and significant labour shortages in partner countries.
	
这些考虑导致 IRCC 建议 2023 年的合作伙伴配额保持在 2022 年的水平，但全球配额应增加 20% 至 88,500。合作伙伴配额意味着参与者通过合作伙伴国家的认可组织申请。全球配额适用于直接向 IRCC 申请的人。	These considerations led IRCC to recommend that the 2023 partner quotas stay at 2022 levels, but the global quota should be increased by 20% to 88,500. The partner quota means that participants apply through a Recognized Organization from a partner country. The global quota is for those who apply directly to IRCC.
	
全球配额增加的部分原因是联邦政府正在积极评估 IEC 在非洲、亚洲、中东和南美洲的潜在新国家合作伙伴，以帮助长期支持该计划。与更多国家合作也为增加加拿大法语社区的新移民数量打开了大门。	Part of the global quota increase comes as the federal government is actively assessing potential new country partners for the IEC in Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and South America to help bolster the program long-term. Partnering with more countries also opens the door to increasing the number of newcomers in Canada’s francophone communities.
	
IRCC 表示，全球配额增加的另一个原因是该计划没有达到之前的全球最大值 73,655 个激活的工作许可证。该部门表示，提高全球配额有助于抵消“浪费”的数量。这意味着获得工作许可但没有登陆加拿大激活它的外籍青年。	IRCC says another reason for the global quota increase is that the program did not reach its previous global maximum of 73,655 activated work permits. The department says raising the global quota can help offset the amount of “wastage.” This means foreign national youth who obtain a work permit but do not land in Canada to activate it.
	
IRCC 不建议增加合作伙伴配额，因为它预计合作伙伴国家和组织不会欢迎这些变化，尤其是在欧洲，欧洲正在应对与流离失所的乌克兰国民相关的挑战。该部门还表示，今年提高配额将为今后每年的高配额开创先例，如果 IRCC 需要在加拿大未来出现高失业率的情况下减少配额，这可能会降低计划的灵活性。	IRCC does not recommend an increase in partner quotas because it expects that partner countries and organizations would not welcome the changes, particularly in Europe, which is coping with challenges associated with displaced Ukrainian nationals. The department also says that raising the quotas this year would set a precedent for high quotas each year going forward, and this could reduce program flexibility should IRCC need to reduce the quotas should Canada ever experience a high unemployment rate in future.
	
### 加拿大的 IEC 参与者	IEC participants in Canada
	
最高的合作伙伴配额是法国（14,000）、爱尔兰（10,700）、日本（6,500）和英国（5,000）。颁发给澳大利亚人的许可证数量没有配额或限制。	The highest partner quotas are France (14,000), Ireland (10,700), Japan (6,500) and the United Kingdom (5,000). There is no quota, or limit, on the number of permits issued to Australians.
	
大多数 IEC 参与者（超过 40%）搬到了不列颠哥伦比亚省的低陆平原，其中 19% 选择了安大略省，18% 选择了艾伯塔省，14% 选择了魁北克省，而在所有其他省份和地区选择了不到 5%。	The majority of IEC participants, over 40%, move to the lower mainland of British Columbia, with 19% choosing Ontario, 18% in Alberta, 14% in Quebec and less than 5% in all remaining provinces and territories.
	
加拿大目前依靠大量的 IEC 参与者来帮助加拿大填补劳动力缺口。 IEC 参与者通常从事服务行业的工作，包括食品服务和住宿以及零售业。备忘录称，许多雇主，尤其是服务行业的雇主，依靠 IEC 来满足他们的劳动力需求。	Canada currently relies on the high number of IEC participants to help Canada fill gaps in the labour force. IEC participants typically fill jobs in the service sector, including food services and accommodation, and retail. The memo says that many employers, especially in the service sector, depend on IEC to satisfy their labour needs.
	
根据 2019 年的数据，当时有 58,186 名 IEC 参与者激活了他们的许可证。由于签证期限长，加拿大的参与者总数甚至更高，IRCC 报告说，实际上，当年有 87,816 名外国青年在加拿大。	Based on data from 2019 when there were 58,186 IEC participants activated their permits. The total number of participants in Canada was even higher due to the length of the visa and IRCC reports that in reality, 87,816 foreign youth were present in Canada that year.
	
尽管如此，许多 IEC 许可证持有人选择在加拿大期间不工作。根据参与者在 2009 年至 2017 年间提交的所得税申报表，平均收入显示，59% 的参与者的平均收入刚刚超过 10,000 美元。	Still, many IEC permit holders choose not to work during their time in Canada. The average income, according to income tax returns filed by participants between 2009 and 2017, shows that 59% of participants had average earnings of just over $10,000.
	
### IEC 是如何工作的？	How does IEC work?
	
IEC 的参与者可以根据三个流之一获得工作许可。最突出的是工作假期类别，它可以授予长达两年的开放式工作许可证（OWP），允许持有人为加拿大的任何雇主工作。该报告称，88% 的 IEC 参与者通过该流程获得了许可。	Participants in the IEC may obtain a work permit under one of three streams. The most prominent is the Working Holiday stream, which can grant an Open Work Permit (OWP) for up to two years, allowing holders to work for any employer in Canada. The report says 88% of IEC participants are issued permits through this stream.
	
Young Professionals 流签发特定于雇主的工作许可，适用于有工作机会并计划在加拿大与单一雇主一起工作的青年。	The Young Professionals stream issues work permits that are employer-specific for youth that have a job offer and plan to work with a single employer in Canada.
	
第三类是国际合作实习类，它允许来自合作国家的大专学生到一家特定的加拿大公司实习。	The third stream is the International Co-op Internship stream, which allows post-secondary students from partner countries to intern for a specific Canadian company.
