新移民的英语和法语水平提高表明在加拿大取得成功的潜力更大 语言融合是加拿大移民成功的重要指标。好消息是，最近的加拿大移民由于会说英语或法语而处于成功的有利位置。	Heightened proficiency in English and French among recent immigrants indicates greater potential for success in Canada Linguistic integration is a vital indicator of immigrant success in Canada. The good news is that most recent Canadian immigrants are in a good position to succeed because of their ability to speak English or French.
	
根据 2022 年第四季度发布的 2021 年加拿大人口普查，在 2016 年至 2021 年期间移民到加拿大的每 10 人中就有超过 9 人表示能够用英语或法语进行对话。	According to the 2021 Canadian census, which was released in Q4 2022, more than 9 in 10 people who immigrated to Canada between 2016 and 2021 reported being able to conduct a conversation in English or French.
	
尽管大多数新移民 (69.4%) 称非官方语言是他们的母语，但该群体中 92.7% 的人自称能够使用加拿大两种官方语言中的一种进行交谈。	Although most recent immigrants (69.4%) reported non-official languages as their mother tongue, 92.7% of people in this group self-reported being able to conversate in one of Canada’s two official languages.
	
此外，人口普查数据显示，62.3% 以非官方语言为母语的新移民表示，他们在家里会说英语或法语，要么单独说，要么说另一种语言。	Additionally, census data reveals that 62.3% of recent immigrants with non-official languages as their mother tongue said that they speak either English or French at home, either alone or with another language.
	
### 为什么官方语言能力如此重要？	Why is official language proficiency so important?
	
从历史上看，官方语言能力一直是加拿大新移民更有可能在这个国家取得成功的信号。	Official language proficiency has historically been a signal that newcomers to Canada are more likely to find success in this country.
	
这方面的证据可以从综合排名系统 (CRS) 在对 Express Entry 候选人评分时对官方语言能力的强调中找到。作为移民到这个国家的主要方法之一，加拿大优先考虑希望快速入境的人用英语和/或法语说话、交谈、阅读和写作的能力。事实上，CRS 评分为 Express Entry 申请人的第一官方语言能力提供了最高 320 分（有配偶/伴侣）或 310 分（没有配偶/伴侣）。这意味着说加拿大官方语言之一的能力会显着影响一个人的 CRS 分数。	Evidence of this can be found in the emphasis placed on official language proficiency by the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) when scoring Express Entry candidates. As one of the primary methods of immigration to this country, Canada prioritizes the ability of Express Entry hopefuls to speak, conversate, read and write in English and/or French. In fact, CRS scoring provides a maximum of 320 (with spouse/partner) or 310 (without spouse/partner) points to Express Entry applicants for first official language proficiency. This means that the ability to speak one of Canada’s official languages can significantly impact one’s CRS score.
	
### 这对刚到加拿大的新移民意味着什么？	What does this mean for recent newcomers to Canada?
	
最近加拿大移民的英语和法语水平提高表明，与上述情况一致，他们现在比以往任何时候都更适合在加拿大取得成功。	The heightened proficiency in English and French among recent Canadian immigrants suggests, in line with the above, that they are better suited now than ever to succeed in Canada.
	
加拿大统计局 (StatsCan) 2020 年 3 月的一份报告指出，语言能力是提高加拿大移民短期、中期和长期收入的主要因素。	A March 2020 report from Statistics Canada (StatsCan) outlines that language ability is a primary factor in boosting Canadian immigrants’ short-term, medium-term, and long-term earnings.
	
在移民到加拿大的头一到两年里，StatsCan 的研究表明，“那些以非官方语言为母语（但说英语）的人的收入比”以英语或法语为母语的人低 29%。这表明，随着官方语言能力的提高，2016 年至 2021 年间的新移民比不会说英语或法语的移民收入更高。	In the first one to two years of immigrating to Canada, StatsCan research indicates that “those who had a non-official language as their mother tongue (but who spoke English) earned 29% less than” native English or French speakers. This would suggest that with better official language proficiency, recent immigrants between 2016 and 2021 are positioned to experience higher earnings than those who cannot conversate in English or French.
	
根据 StatsCan 的数据，中期（移民后五到六年）和长期（移民到加拿大后 10 到 11 年）也是如此。以加拿大官方语言中的任何一种为母语的研究参与者在中期窗口中的收入比非母语人士高 42%，而那些更擅长英语或法语的人的长期收入高 35%。	The same is true in the medium-term (five to six years after immigration) and long-term (10 to 11 years after immigrating to Canada), according to StatsCan. Research participants with either of Canada’s official languages as a mother tongue experienced 42% higher earnings in the medium-term window than non-native speakers and long-term earnings were 35% higher for those more adept in English or French.
	
同样，因此可以推断，由于他们能够用英语或法语进行对话，属于这一群体的 92.7% 的新移民比没有这种能力的人在加拿大获得成功的机会更大。	Again, it can therefore be reasoned that, due to their ability to have a conversation in English or French, the 92.7% of recent immigrants who fall into this group have a better chance of success in Canada than they would without such ability.
