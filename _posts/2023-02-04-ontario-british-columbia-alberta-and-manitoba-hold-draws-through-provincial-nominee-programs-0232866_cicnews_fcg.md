安大略省、不列颠哥伦比亚省、阿尔伯塔省和马尼托巴省通过省提名计划举行抽签。本周有四个省邀请参加 PNP 抽签的候选人。	Ontario, British Columbia, Alberta, and Manitoba hold draws through Provincial Nominee Programs. Four provinces invite candidates in PNP draws this week.
	
本周，安大略省、不列颠哥伦比亚省、阿尔伯塔省和马尼托巴省已发出邀请，通过省提名计划 (PNP) 向候选人提出申请。	Ontario, British Columbia, Alberta and Manitoba have issued invitations to apply to candidates through Provincial Nominee Programs (PNPs) this week.
	
大多数加拿大省和地区（魁北克和努纳武特除外）都有自己的省提名计划 (PNP)。通过这些项目，有兴趣的候选人可能会被邀请申请省提名。获得省提名有利于获得永久居留权。	Most Canadian provinces and territories (except for Quebec and Nunavut) operate their own Provincial Nominee Programs (PNPs). Through these programs, interested candidates may be invited to apply for provincial nomination. Receiving a provincial nomination can be advantageous for gaining permanent residence.
	
魁北克的移民计划由该省管理，与加拿大的移民计划不同。魁北克省是唯一一个控制所有经济类移民的省份。	Quebec’s immigration programs are administered by the province and are distinct from Canada’s immigration programs. Quebec is the only province that has control over all economic class immigrants.
	
省提名计划 (PNP) 每年有 105,000 名永久居民。它始于 1998 年，此后每年 PNP 录取人数稳步增长。	The Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) accounts for 105,000 PR admissions per year. It began in 1998 and the annual number of PNP admissions has since increased steadily.
	
联邦和省政府都认为这是促进城市中心以外地区经济发展的有效工具。	Both federal and provincial governments consider it an effective tool to promote economic development outside of urban centers.
	
抽签发生在同一周，加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 向已经获得省提名的快速通道候选人发出了 893 份 ITA。除魁北克省和努纳武特地区外，大多数加拿大省份和地区都有与“快速通道”保持一致的 PNP。	The draws occurred within the same week that Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) issued 893 ITAs to Express Entry candidates who already had a provincial nomination. Most Canadian provinces and territories have PNPs aligned with Express Entry, except for Quebec and Nunavut.
	
这是自 2022 年 6 月以来首次针对 PNP 候选人的快速通道抽签。从 7 月到最近的抽签，所有快速通道抽签都是全项目抽签。	This was the first Express Entry draw to target PNP candidates since June 2022. Between July and the recent draw, all Express Entry draws have been all-program draws.
	
### 1月28日-2月3日省移民结果	Provincial immigration results January 28-February 3
	
**安大略**	**Ontario**
	
安大略省于 1 月 31 日向安大略省移民提名计划 (OINP) 的雇主工作机会：外国工人类别的候选人发出了 611 份邀请。抽签针对的是医疗保健和科技职业。候选人需要至少 53 分才能收到邀请。	Ontario issued 611 invitations to apply to candidates in the Employer Job Offer: Foreign Worker stream of the Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program (OINP) on January 31. The draw was targeted toward healthcare and tech occupations. Candidates required a minimum score of 53 to receive an invitation.
	
符合条件的候选人需要在安大略省提供符合国家职业分类 (NOC) 的 TEER 类别 0、1、2 或 3 标准的全职工作机会。	Eligible candidates required a full-time job offer in Ontario that meets the criteria for TEER category 0, 1, 2 or 3 of the National Occupational Classification (NOC).
	
此外，安大略省于 2 月 2 日对人力资本优先类别的候选人进行了两次有针对性的抽签。该省邀请了 1,175 名技术职业的候选人，最低分数在 481-489 之间，以及医疗保健职业的 725 名候选人，最低分数在 476-476- 489.	Additionally, Ontario held two targeted draws for candidates in the Human Capital Priorities stream on February 2. The province invited 1,175 candidates in a tech occupation with a minimum score between 481-489  as well as 725 candidates in healthcare occupations with minimum score between 476-489.
	
**艾伯塔省**	**Alberta**
	
在公布的 2023 年第二轮抽签结果中，阿尔伯塔省于 1 月 23 日向阿尔伯塔省优势移民计划 (AAIP) 的快速通道类别的候选人发出了 154 份意向书通知，并于 1 月 19 日发出了 46 份意向书。	In the second round of published draw results for 2023, Alberta issued 154 notifications of letters of interest to candidates in the Express Entry stream of the Alberta Advantage Immigration Program (AAIP) on January 23, as well as 46 letters of interest on January 19.
	
该省最近宣布，在从联邦快速通道池中完成抽签时，将根据高需求职业和直系亲属关系作为选择因素，邀请 AAIP 中的快速通道候选人。	The province recently announced that Express Entry candidates in the AAIP will be invited based on a combination of high-demand occupations and immediate family ties as selection factors when completing draws from the federal Express Entry pool.
	
AAIP 的任何流中的资格标准都没有变化。	There is no change to the eligibility criteria in any stream of the AAIP.
	
**不列颠哥伦比亚省**	**British Columbia**
	
不列颠哥伦比亚省于 1 月 31 日邀请了超过 279 名候选人申请省提名。	British Columbia invited more than 279 candidates to apply for provincial nomination on January 31.
	
该省邀请了 243 名候选人参加有针对性的技术职业抽签。邀请函发给了技术工人和国际毕业生类别的候选人，其中包括快速通道候选人。	The province invited 243 candidates in a targeted draw for tech occupations. The invitations were issued to candidates in the Skilled Worker and International Graduates categories and included Express Entry candidates.
	
来自技术工人和国际研究生流的候选人要求 SIRS 的最低分数为 85。SIRS 的作用与快速通道综合排名系统 (CRS) 非常相似，但仅用于不列颠哥伦比亚省的 PNP。	Candidates from the Skilled Worker and International Graduate stream required a minimum SIRS score of 85. SIRS acts much like the Express Entry Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) but is only used for British Columbia’s PNP.
	
该省还对从事以下职业的候选人进行了轮次邀请：	The province also held rounds of invitations for candidates working in the following occupations:
	
* 18名幼儿教育工作者和助理（NOC 4214），分数至少为60分；	  18 early childhood educators and assistants (NOC 4214) with scores of at least 60 points;
* 18名技术工人，国际毕业生，包括快速入境类别的医护人员，分数至少为60分；	  18 healthcare workers from the Skilled Worker, International Graduate, including Express Entry category, with scores of at least 60 points and;

**曼尼托巴**	**Manitoba**
	
曼尼托巴省于 1 月 30 日发出了 21 封申请通知书。这些信件是根据该省针对逃离乌克兰冲突的人的特殊移民措施发出的。要根据此途径考虑移民，候选人必须是：	Manitoba issued 21 Letters of Advice to Apply on January 30. The letters were issued under the province’s special immigration measure for those fleeing the conflict in Ukraine. To be considered for immigration under this pathway, candidates must be:
