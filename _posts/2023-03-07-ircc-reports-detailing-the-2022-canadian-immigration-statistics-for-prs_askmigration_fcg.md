这些出版物进一步表明，在过去两年中，加拿大创造了超过 2022-2024 年移民水平计划所规定的移民目标的记录。数据显示，2022 年 PR 数量为 437 人，其中 120 人超过了目标限制，移民数量达到惊人的 5,000 人。	The publications further indicate that in these last two years, Canada has made a record of surpassing its immigration targets documented by the 2022-2024 Immigration Level Plans.

除了 2013 年和 2021 年，2022 年是唯一接收超过 400,000 名移民的年份。有史以来最糟糕的一年是 2020 年，当时由于新型 COVID-19 大流行，该国被迫仅接受 184, 000 名移民。当时有严格的旅行限制，这是世界卫生组织和世界其他卫生组织为抗击病毒性疾病传播而制定的措施的一部分。	Apart from 2013 and 2021, 2022 was the only other year that accepted over 400, 000 immigrants.

经济舱移民计划是该国欢迎的人数最多的人。特别是在 2022 年，这些项目在该国接受了 256,000 份 PR。根据 2022-2024 年移民水平计划设定的目标，这个数字超过了惊人的 5.8%。	Economic-Class immigration programs account for the largest amounts of people welcomed to the country. In particular, in 2022, the programs accounted for 256,000 PRs accepted in the country. As per the target set by Immigration Levels Plan of 2022-2024, this number surpassed the level by a staggering 5.8 percent.
	
另一个欢迎许多 PR 的类别是类移民计划。这些类别欢迎 97、165 名 PR 移民进入该国。尽管这个数字很高，但该计划未能达到 2022-2024 年移民水平计划设定的 105, 000 目标。	Another category that welcomed many PRs was the class immigration programs.

该类别占 2022 年接受的所有 PR 移民的 22%。但是，IRCC 的目标是使这些类别的移民人数达到总数的 24%。	The category accounted for 22 percent of all PR immigrants accepted in 2022. However, the IRCC had targeted for these categories to produce up to 24 percent of the total number.
