工作许可证持有人的家庭成员现在可以在加拿大工作，无论主申请人的职业技能水平如何。	Family members of work permit holders can now work in Canada, regardless of the principal applicant’s occupation skill level.
	
自 2023 年 1 月 30 日起，工作许可持有人的家庭成员可以在加拿大工作，无论主申请人的职业技能水平如何。	As of January 30, 2023, family members of work permit holders can work in Canada, regardless of the principal applicant’s occupation skill level.
	
在移民部长肖恩·弗雷泽 (Sean Fraser) 于 12 月 2 日宣布之前，只有某些职业的工作许可证持有人才有资格携带其配偶。具体来说，被认为是“高技能”的职业。	Prior to Immigration Minister Sean Fraser’s December 2 announcement, only work permit holders in certain occupations were eligible to bring their spouses. Specifically, occupations that were considered “high-skilled”.
	
但这已经改变了。为了解决加拿大的劳动力短缺问题并让家庭团聚，加拿大已经开始了一项为期两年的措施，以扩大所有职业技能水平的外国工人家庭的资格。	But that has changed. In an effort to address Canada’s labour shortages and keep families together, Canada has begun a two-year measure to expand eligibility to the families of foreign workers in all occupation skill levels.
	
这意味着，例如，医疗保健、贸易和酒店业工人的家庭也可以在加拿大工作。在媒体发布的新闻稿中，加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 估计，由于这项措施，超过 200,000 名外国工人可能会开始在加拿大工作。	That would mean families of workers in health care, trades, and hospitality, for example, would be able to work in Canada as well. In a media release, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) estimates more than 200,000 foreign workers could begin working in Canada as a result of this measure.
	
IRCC 将分三个阶段实施该措施：	IRCC will implement the measure in three phases:
	
* 第 1 阶段：使通过临时外国工人计划或国际流动计划的高工资流来到加拿大的工人的家庭成员能够申请开放式工作许可证。	  Phase 1: Enable family members of workers coming to Canada through the high-wage stream of the Temporary Foreign Worker Program or the International Mobility Program to apply for an open work permit.
* 第 2 阶段：经磋商后，将措施扩大至临时外国工人计划的低薪工人的家庭成员。	  Phase 2: Expand the measure to the family members of workers from the low-wage stream of the Temporary Foreign Worker Program, following consultations.
* 第 3 阶段：与农业合作伙伴和利益相关者进行磋商，以评估将该措施扩大到农业工人家庭成员的操作可行性。	  Phase 3: Conduct consultations with agricultural partners and stakeholders to assess operational feasibility for expanding the measure to family members of agricultural workers.
	
“无论我走到哪里，全国各地的雇主都继续将缺乏工人视为他们最大的障碍，”弗雷泽在媒体发布会上说。 “我们的政府将继续帮助雇主克服劳动力短缺问题，同时支持工人的福祉并使他们的家人团聚。”	“Everywhere I go, employers across the country continue to identify a lack of workers as their biggest obstacle,” Fraser said in a media release. “Our government is going to continue helping employers overcome labour shortages, while also supporting the well-being of workers and uniting their families.”
	
IRCC 媒体发布称，加拿大在 2022 年 1 月至 2022 年 10 月期间签发了超过 645,000 个工作许可证，几乎是 2021 年同期签发的 163,000 个的四倍。	The IRCC media release says Canada has issued more than 645,000 work permits between January and October 2022, which is nearly four times more than the 163,000 issued throughout the same period in 2021.
	
值得注意的是，为了有资格获得配偶开放式工签，主申请人必须在加拿大受雇。	Notably, in order to be eligible for the spousal open work permit, the principal applicant must be employed in Canada.
	
### International Experience Canada 属于新措施	International Experience Canada falls under new measure
	
加拿大国际经验 (IEC) 工作许可是国际流动计划 (IMP) 的一部分，该计划包含在新措施中。因此，从事任何职业的 IEC 工作许可证持有人最早可以在第一阶段实施时携带家人。	International Experience Canada (IEC) work permits are a part of the International Mobility Program (IMP), which is included in the new measure. Therefore, IEC work permit holders working in any occupation could be able to bring their family members as early as the first phase of implementation.
	
如果您年龄在 18-35 岁之间并且是 36 个参与国家/地区之一的公民，则您可能有资格参加 IEC 计划。请记住，每个国家/地区与加拿大都有自己的互惠协议，这意味着某些资格要求（例如年龄）将根据您来自的国家/地区和您有资格参加的 IEC 计划而改变。	You may be eligible for an IEC program if you are between the ages of 18-35 and a citizen of one of 36 participating countries. Keep in mind, each country has its own reciprocal agreement with Canada, which means certain eligibility requirements—such as age—will change depending on the country you’re from and the IEC program you are eligible for.
	
您可以通过查看此页面上的参与国家/地区列表来了解您的国家/地区是否符合条件。	You can find out if your country is eligible by checking the participating countries list on this page.
	
IEC 下有三个工作许可项目：	There are three work permit programs under the IEC:
	
* 打工度假签证：开放式工作许可计划，让您可以在任何地方为加拿大的任何雇主工作。	  Working Holiday Visa: an open work permit program that lets you work anywhere for any employer in Canada.
* International Co-Op：封闭式工作许可，专为希望获得与其学习领域相关工作经验的学生而设计。	  International Co-Op: a closed work permit designed for students who wish to get work experience related to their field of study.
* 年轻专业人士：封闭式工作许可证，适用于在抵达加拿大之前已获得有效工作邀请的人士。	  Young Professionals: a closed work permit for people who have a valid job offer in Canada prior to their arrival.
	
虽然在技术职业中工作的 IEC 持有人以前被允许携带配偶的开放式工作许可证，但新措施为所有职业的工人提供了同样的机会。公告并不表示流程发生了变化，只是向更多人开放。	Although IEC holders working in skilled occupations were previously allowed to bring an accompanying spouse on an open work permit, the new measure opens the same opportunity to workers in all occupations. The announcement does not suggest that the process has changed, just that it is open to more people.
	
IEC 2023 赛季已于 2023 年 1 月 9 日开幕。加拿大预计明年将通过 IEC 迎来 90,000 名外国工人。	The IEC 2023 season has opened as of January 9, 2023. Canada is expecting to welcome 90,000 foreign workers through the IEC next year.
