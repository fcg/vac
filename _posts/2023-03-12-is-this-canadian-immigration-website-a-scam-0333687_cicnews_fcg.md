# 这个加拿大移民网站是骗局吗？在您的加拿大移民旅程中使用互联网时，请注意“保证成功”的声明、加速处理的承诺和这些其他标志。	Is this Canadian immigration website a scam? Watch out for claims of “guaranteed success”, promises of expedited processing and these other signs when using the internet as part of your Canadian immigration journey.
加拿大移民系统越来越多地利用互联网的力量来促进新移民旅程的许多部分。	The Canadian immigration system is increasingly using the power of the internet to facilitate many parts of the newcomer journey.
	
到 2022 年底，加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC)“开始向所有永久居留计划的 100% 数字申请过渡”，这一过程于 10 月 28 日结束。	Toward the end of 2022, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) “began its transition to 100% digital applications for all permanent residence programs”, a process that concluded on October 28.
	
**注意：**此过渡仍然为需要住宿的申请人保留了替代格式	**Note:** This transition still maintained alternative formats for applicants who require accommodations
	
为了进一步推动加拿大移民的数字化转型，IRCC 还创建并推出了一个在线门户网站，旨在让“加拿大的永久居留申请人能够在线完成他们的流程并获得他们的永久居留卡”。根据 2022 年 1 月新闻稿的数据，2021 年 6 月至 2021 年 12 月期间，有 225,000 名永久居民使用了该门户网站。	Further to the digital transformation of Canadian immigration, IRCC has also created and launched an online portal designed to allow “permanent residence applicants in Canada to finalize their process and receive their permanent residency cards” online. According to data from a January 2022 news release, 225,000 permanent residents took advantage of this portal between June and December 2021.
	
作为最后一个例子，IRCC 最近提出了公民身份法规修正案，使未来的加拿大公民最早可以在 2023 年 6 月“通过安全的在线解决方案进行\[公民身份\]宣誓”。	As a final example, IRCC recently proposed Citizenship regulation amendments that would enable future Canadian citizens to “take the \[citizenship\] oath via a secure online solution” as early as June 2023.
	
毫无疑问，加拿大移民正变得比以往任何时候都更加数字化。然而，这一发展并不完全是积极的，因为它可能会使更多潜在的加拿大移民通过虚假移民网站遭受欺诈和诈骗。	Undoubtedly, Canadian immigration is becoming more digital than ever before. However, this development has not been entirely positive, as it may expose more prospective Canadian immigrants to fraud and scams through fake immigration websites.
	
为此，本着 3 月作为 IRCC 防欺诈月的精神，以下是加拿大政府关于如何识别加拿大移民网站是否可能是骗局的六个提示：	To that end, and in the spirit of March being IRCC’s fraud prevention month, here are six tips from the Government of Canada on how to identify if a Canadian immigration website could be a scam:
	
**1\.该网站是在一封未经请求的电子邮件中发布的广告**	**1\. The website was advertised in an unsolicited email**
	
如果移民网站的链接来自陌生人的电子邮件，而收件人并没有要求，则可以安全地假设该网站可能是骗局。	If the link to an immigration website comes via an email from a stranger that the email recipient did not ask for, it is safe to assume that the website is likely a scam.
	
**2\。该网站似乎不是由加拿大政府创建的**	**2\. The website does not seem to be created by the Canadian government**
	
加拿大官方政府网站通常可以通过两个关键特征来识别。	Official Canadian government websites are typically identifiable by two key characteristics.
	
- 它们包括加拿大两种官方语言、英语和法语的内容	-   They include content in both of Canada’s official languages, English and French
- 他们有 Canada.ca URL 或以“gc.ca”结尾的 URL	-   They have a Canada.ca URL or a URL that ends in “gc.ca”
	
不应信任看起来像加拿大政府财产但不具备这些特征的网站。	Websites that look like Government of Canada properties but do not have these characteristics should not be trusted.
	
**3\。它提供“有保障的”移民或做出其他不切实际的承诺**	**3\. It offers “guaranteed” immigration or makes other unrealistic promises**
	
在任何情况下，任何移民代表/工具（网站等）都不能保证成功成为加拿大移民申请人。申请人不应相信任何做出此类肯定性声明、向用户承诺一旦登陆加拿大就会获得高薪工作或提倡加速申请处理的网站。	Under no circumstance can any immigration representative/tool (website etc.) guarantee success as a Canadian immigration applicant. Applicants should not trust any websites that make such affirmative claims, promise users a high-paying job once landed in Canada, or promote expedited application processing.
	
**4\。该网站要求付费才能访问表格/指南**	**4\. The website asks for payment to access forms/guides**
	
IRCC 明确表示，只有在处理加拿大移民申请时才需要付款。表格、指南和其他补充材料可在 IRCC 网站上免费获取。	IRCC makes it clear that payment is only required to process Canadian immigration applications. Forms, guides and other supplementary materials are free to access on the IRCC website.
	
**5\。它需要个人/财务信息，申请流程前的押金**	**5\. It requires personal/financial information, a deposit prior to the application process**
	
与上述类似，任何在申请流程之前要求提供敏感信息（例如银行详细信息或社会保险号 (SIN)）的网站都应被视为不可信。为此，任何要求用户在开始申请加拿大移民计划之前提前支付押金的网站也是如此。	Similar to the above, any website that requests sensitive information such as banking details or a Social Insurance Number (SIN) prior to the application process should be considered untrustworthy. To that end, the same is true of any website that requires users to pay a deposit in advance of beginning to apply for a Canadian immigration program.
	
**6\。它缺少联系信息和/或代表的凭证**	**6\. It is missing contact information and/or the representative’s credentials**
	
不要相信完全省略联系信息或无法通过网站提供的联系信息联系到任何人的移民网站。同样，如果该网站提供了移民顾问/律师/代表或公司的姓名，但没有识别他们的证书，用户应该假定该服务提供商未经授权，因此不值得信任。	Do not trust immigration websites that either omit contact information entirely or in cases where no human can be reached through the website’s provided contact information. Likewise, if the website provides the name of an immigration consultant/lawyer/representative or company but does not identify their credentials, users should assume that the service provider is unauthorized and therefore untrustworthy.
	
### 避免移民网站诈骗	Avoiding immigration website scams
	
防范在线诈骗的最佳方法是寻求加拿大授权移民律师的帮助和建议。该行业的认证律师必须注册为加拿大省或地区法律协会的会员。	The best way to protect against online scams is to seek the assistance and advice of an authorized Canadian immigration lawyer. Certified lawyers in this industry must be registered as a member of a Canadian provincial or territorial law society.
	
经授权且经验丰富的移民律师可以通过不同方式帮助潜在的加拿大移民，包括：	The different ways that an authorized and experienced immigration lawyer can help prospective Canadian immigrants include:
	
- 准确完整地准备移民申请	-   Accurately and completely preparing their immigration applications
- 确保申请人在申请时避免错误	-   Ensuring applicants avoid mistakes with their application
- 代表申请人回复加拿大政府	-   Responding to the Canadian government on behalf of an applicant
- 利用他们的专业知识避免在不同的申请步骤和申请处理过程中出现不必要的延误	-   Using their expertise to avoid unnecessary delays throughout the different application steps and application processing
