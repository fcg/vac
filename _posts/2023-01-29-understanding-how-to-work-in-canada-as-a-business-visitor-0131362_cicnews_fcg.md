作为商务访客在加拿大工作 了解来加拿大从事国际商业活动的外国人如何被视为商务访客，假定他们不会进入加拿大劳动力市场。	Working in Canada as a business visitor Learn how a foreign national coming to Canada to conduct international business activities is considered a business visitor, presuming that they will not enter the Canadian labour market.
	
前往加拿大的商务访客享有一些特殊的工作特权，并非所有来加拿大工作的国际人士都享有这些特权。其中一项特权是免除加拿大工作许可的要求。	Business visitors to Canada are afforded some special work privileges that are not given to all international persons coming to this country for work. One of those privileges is an exemption from requiring a Canadian work permit.
	
### 为什么加拿大允许商务访客在没有工作许可的情况下来加拿大	Why Canada allows business visitors to come to Canada without work permits
	
加拿大的经济繁荣极大地受益于允许来自世界各地的商人在加拿大开展业务。这是因为加拿大的经济在与世界各国的合作和关系建设中蓬勃发展。从贸易协定到经济伙伴关系，加拿大与许多国家都有互惠关系，允许加拿大人进入他们的国家开展业务。因此，加拿大的运作方式大致相同，因为互惠是加拿大经济发展的关键。	Canada’s economic prosperity benefits greatly from allowing businesspeople from around the world to conduct business in Canada. This is because Canada upholds an economy that thrives on cooperation and relationship-building with countries around the world. From trade agreements to economic partnerships, Canada has reciprocal relationships with many countries that allow Canadians to enter their countries for business. Accordingly, Canada operates much the same way, as reciprocity is key to Canada’s economic development.

例如，作为经济合作组织和 G7 的成员，以及加拿大-美国-墨西哥协定（CUSMA，前身为北美自由贸易协定或 NAFTA）等协定，加拿大在强调确保国际业务可以在加拿大轻松顺利地进行。	For instance, as a member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and the G7, among other things such as the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA, formerly known as the North American Free Trade Agreement or NAFTA), Canada places great emphasis on ensuring that international business can easily and smoothly be conducted in Canada.
	
同样，出于这个原因，一些来加拿大的商务访客无需先获得工作许可即可抵达并履行其职责。	Again, for that reason, some business visitors to Canada can arrive and perform their duties without requiring a work permit first.
	
注意：前往加拿大的商务访客可能仍需要临时居民签证 (TRV) 或电子旅行授权 (eTA) 才能在该国开展业务。	Note: Business visitors to Canada may still need a Temporary Resident Visa (TRV) or an Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA) to conduct business in this country.
	
### 外国公民必须满足哪些条件才能成为加拿大的商务访客？	What are the criteria that foreign nationals must meet to qualify as business visitors to Canada?
	
对于访问加拿大和开展业务的外国国民，他们必须向加拿大当局展示某些东西。例如，潜在的商务访客必须：	For a foreign national to visit Canada and conduct business, there are certain things they must display to Canadian authorities. For example, prospective business visitors must:
	
* 证明他们打算在加拿大停留少于六个月	  Demonstrate that they intend to stay in Canada for less than six months
* 证明他们无意进入加拿大劳动力市场	  Prove that they have no intention of entering the Canadian labour market
* 表明他们的主要营业地点以及主要收入和利润来源在加拿大境外	  Show that their main place of business, as well as their main source of income and profit, is outside of Canada
* 出示申请所需的证明文件	  Present requested supporting documents for their application
* 满足加拿大的基本入学要求	  Meet Canada’s basic entry requirements
	
关于上面列表中的最后一个项目符号，加拿大的基本入境要求包括以下内容。	Pertaining to the final bullet on the above list, Canada’s basic entry requirements include the following.
	
* 持有有效旅行证件（例如护照）	  Having a valid travel document (ex. passport)
* 拥有足够的钱留在加拿大并返回家园	  Possessing enough money to stay in Canada and return home
* 计划在访问结束后离开加拿大	  Having a plan to leave Canada at the end of their visit
* 证明不会对加拿大人构成犯罪、安全或健康风险	  Proving not to be a criminal, security, or health risk to Canadians
	
现在，以下两节将对加拿大划分前来该国的潜在商务访客的具体方式提供一些必要的说明。	Now, the following two sections will provide some necessary clarity on the specific ways that Canada divides prospective business visitors coming to this country.
	
### 谁不被视为加拿大的商务访客？	Who is not considered a business visitor in Canada?
	
重要的是，我们首先要澄清在什么情况下来加拿大开展业务的外国人不被视为商务访客。	It is important that we first clarify the circumstances under which a foreign national coming to conduct business in Canada is not considered a business visitor.
	
1. 来加拿大履行涉及动手建造的职责的个人	1.  Individuals coming to Canada to perform duties involving hands-on building and construction
2. 在签署初始销售或租赁/租赁协议后，根据第三方（既不是加拿大公司也不是一起工作的外国组织）谈判达成的服务合同来到该国工作的个人	2.  Individuals coming to this country to work under a service contract negotiated by a third party (not either the Canadian company or a foreign organization working together) after the signing of the initial sales or lease/renal agreement
3. 在加拿大工作的外籍人士不在保修范围内	3.  Foreign nationals performing work in Canada not covered by a warranty
4. 如果进入加拿大的外国雇员在一家国际公司工作，该公司直接与加拿大组织签订服务合同。在这种情况下，加拿大公司与外国组织之间的合同意味着进入加拿大劳动力市场。	4.  If the foreign employee entering Canada is working for an international company that was directly contracted for service by a Canadian organization. In this case, a contract between a Canadian company and a foreign organization signifies an entry into the Canadian labour market.
	
前任。如果一家加拿大公司与一家美国组织签订服务合同，而美国公司派遣一个团队到加拿大现场工作，这意味着美国团队成员都在加拿大工作，国际公司将获得补偿他们在工作中的角色。在这种情况下，美国国民将不符合商务访客的资格。	Ex. Should a Canadian company contract the services of a U.S. organization, and the U.S. company were to send a team to work on-site in Canada, that would mean that the U.S. team members are both working in Canada and the international firm is being compensated for their role in the work. In this situation, the American nationals would not qualify as business visitors.
	
### 谁被视为加拿大的商务访客？	Who is considered a business visitor in Canada?
	
相反，这里有一些情况的例子，在这些情况下，来加拿大的外国公民被认为属于该国对商务访客的定义。	Conversely, here are a few examples of situations in which foreign nationals coming to Canada are considered to fall into the country’s definition of a business visitor.
	
1. 维修和服务、监督安装人员和设置（不包括管道安装等动手安装）和测试商业或工业设备（例如计算机软件）的个人	1.  Individuals repairing and servicing, supervising installers, and setting up (not including hands-on installation such as pipefitting) and testing commercial or industrial equipment (ex. computer software)
2. 希望维修或维修在加拿大境外购买或租赁的设备的个人，只要所执行的服务是原始或扩展的销售/租赁/租赁协议或保修的一部分	2.  Individuals looking to repair or service equipment purchased or leased outside Canada, so long as the services being performed are part of the original or extended sales/lease/rental agreement or warranty
3. 对以前出售或租赁的设备进行软件升级的个人	3.  Individuals performing a software upgrade for previously sold or leased equipment
4. 安装、配置或培训他人升级软件的个人	4.  Individuals installing, configuring, or training others on upgraded software
5. 来加拿大处理保修和服务协议的个人，如果这项工作的合同已作为原始销售/租赁/租赁协议的一部分进行谈判，或者是原始协议的延伸	5.  Individuals coming to Canada to handle warranty and service agreements, in the case that contracts for this work have been negotiated as part of the original sale/lease/rental agreement or are an extension of the original agreement
	
### 符合条件的商务访客在加拿大期间可以做什么？	What can eligible business visitors do while they are in Canada?
	
根据上述信息，以下是加拿大的商务访客在该国逗留期间可以参与的一些不同活动。商务访客可以：	In line with the above-outlined information, here are some different activities that a business visitor to Canada can engage in during their time in the country. Business visitors can:
	
* 参加商务会议、会议、会议、展览会	  Attend business meetings, conferences, conventions, fairs
* 代表外国实体购买加拿大商品或服务	  Buy Canadian goods or services on behalf of a foreign entity
*接受商品或服务的订单	  Take orders for goods or services
* 提供售后服务（不包括建筑行业的实际工作）	  Provide after-sales service (excluding hands-on work in the construction trades)
* 接受加拿大母公司在加拿大境外工作的培训	  Receive training from a Canadian parent company for work outside of Canada
