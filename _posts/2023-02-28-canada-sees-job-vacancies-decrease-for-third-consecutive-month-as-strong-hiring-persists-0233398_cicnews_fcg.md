# 加拿大的职位空缺连续第三个月减少，因为强劲的招聘持续 12 月标志着职位空缺连续第三个月减少，因为就业人数大幅增加。	Canada sees job vacancies decrease for third consecutive month, as strong hiring persists December marked the third consecutive month where job vacancies decreased, as payroll employment experiences huge gains.
2022 年 12 月标志着加拿大 COVID 后恢复工作又一个富有成效的月份。职位空缺总数下降至 848,000 个，而工资就业（从雇主那里领取工资或福利的人数）在 2022 年的最后一个月增加了 91,400 个职位。	December 2022 marked another productive month for Canada’s post-COVID recovery efforts. Total job vacancies fell to 848,000, while payroll employment (the number of people receiving either pay or benefits from their employer) increased as 91,400 positions were filled in the final month of 2022.
	
虽然加拿大劳动力市场朝着增加就业人数和减少职位空缺的方向发展，但面对劳动力短缺，一些行业继续存在集中和持续的空缺职位。从 11 月 (849,200) 到 2022 年 12 月，这些因素的影响逐月变化不大，这意味着许多需求职位仍然空缺，劳动力是一个关键问题。	While the Canadian labour market progresses towards increasing payroll employment and decreasing job vacancies, several industries continue to have concentrated and persistent vacant positions in the face of labour shortages. Month-to-month, the effect of these factors has yielded little change in total job vacancies from November (849,200) to December of 2022—meaning that many in demand positions remain vacant and labour is a key concern.
	
### 尽管就业人数增加，但哪些行业仍然存在职位空缺？	Which sectors continued to have vacancies, despite employment increases?
	
请注意，如果出现以下情况，职位将被视为空缺：	Note that a job is considered vacant if:
	
- 存在特定职位；	-   A specific position exists;
- 工作可在 30 天内开始；和	-   Work could start within 30 days; and
- 雇主正在积极寻找组织外的员工来填补该职位。	-   The employer is actively looking for workers from outside the organization to fill the position.
	
五个行业占加拿大所有职位空缺的 55%。这些曾经是：	Five sectors accounted for 55% of all vacancies in Canada. These were:
	
- 医疗保健和社会援助（149,800 个职位空缺）；	-   Health care and social assistance (149,800 vacancies);
- 住宿和餐饮服务（108,000 个职位空缺）；	-   Accommodation and food services (108,000 vacancies);
- 零售业（100,200 个职位空缺）；	-   Retail trade (100,200 vacancies);
- 建筑业（77,400）；	-   Construction (77,400);
- 制造业（71,700）；和	-   Manufacturing (71,700); and
——专业科技服务（5.81万）。	-   Professional scientific and technical services (58,100).
	
**医疗保健和社会援助**	**Health care and social assistance**
	
对加拿大来说最紧迫的是全国医疗保健和社会援助工作者的持续短缺。在就业人数连续四个月出现正增长后，该行业的问题又出现了反弹——12 月份的职位空缺再次增加了 18,200 个职位。职位空缺的增加几乎完全抵消了 11 月份雇用的 19,400 名工人。	Most pressing for Canada is the continued shortage of health care and social assistance workers across the country. After seeing positive gains in payroll employment for four consecutive months, problems for this sector rebounded—as vacancies in December increased again by 18,200 positions. This rise in vacancies has almost completely offset the 19,400 workers who had been hired in November.
	
截至 2022 年 12 月，该行业的职位空缺总数为 149,800 个，是加拿大所有行业中职位空缺最高的。此外，尽管净增长了 [190,600 个工作岗位](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/230223/dq230223a-eng.htm?HPA=1#:~:text=Since%20January %C2%A02021%2C%20payroll%20employment%20in%20health%20care%20and%20social%20assistance%20has%20seen%20a%20total%20increase%20of%C2%A0190%2C600%C2%A0(%2B9.2% 25).) 在过去两年中，医疗保健和社会援助行业的总体职位空缺几乎没有变化——这是加拿大对这些工人需求的强烈迹象。	Total job vacancies in the sector stood at 149,800 as of December 2022—the highest vacancies of any sector in Canada. Moreover, despite a net growth of [190,600 jobs](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/230223/dq230223a-eng.htm?HPA=1#:~:text=Since%20January%C2%A02021%2C%20payroll%20employment%20in%20health%20care%20and%20social%20assistance%20has%20seen%20a%20total%20increase%20of%C2%A0190%2C600%C2%A0(%2B9.2%25).) in the last two years, the health care and social assistance industry has seen little change in overall vacancies—a strong sign of demand for these workers in Canada.
	
**建造**	**Construction**
	
同样，加拿大建筑业的就业人数在过去四个月连续增长，但仍然存在持续的职位空缺。自 2022 年 11 月（79,000 个职位空缺）以来，该行业的总职位空缺基本没有变化，但自 2021 年 12 月以来有所增加（[61,800](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/220224/ dq220224a-eng.htm#:~:text=As%20winter%20approached%2C%20job%20vacancies%20in%20construction%20fell%20to%C2%A061%2C800%C2%A0in%20December%2C%20the%20third%20consecutive %20monthly%20decline%20from%20a%20record%20high%20(81%2C700)%20reached%20in%20September)）——这也是该领域需求增加和劳动力问题的强烈迹象。	Similarly, Canada’s construction industry saw consistent gains in payroll employment in the last four consecutive months—yet still suffers from persistent vacancies. Total open positions in this sector have been largely unchanged from November of 2022 (79,000 vacancies)) and elevated from December of 2021 ([61,800](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/220224/dq220224a-eng.htm#:~:text=As%20winter%20approached%2C%20job%20vacancies%20in%20construction%20fell%20to%C2%A061%2C800%C2%A0in%20December%2C%20the%20third%20consecutive%20monthly%20decline%20from%20a%20record%20high%20(81%2C700)%20reached%20in%20September))—a strong sign of both increased demand and labour issues in this space as well.
	
### 12 月份哪些行业的招聘人数最多？	What sectors saw the most hiring in December?
	
2022 年 12 月，加拿大以下行业的招聘人数有所增加：	In December 2022, the following sectors saw increased hiring in Canada:
	
- 医疗保健和社会援助（+26,500 个工作岗位）；	-   Health care and social assistance (+26,500 jobs);
- 金融和保险（+13,800 个工作岗位）；和	-   Finance and insurance (+13,800 jobs); and
- 建筑业（+11,500 个工作岗位）。	-   Construction (+11,500 jobs).
	
这里值得注意的是，在 12 月份引领就业增长的三个行业中，其中两个（医疗保健和建筑）也是加拿大职位空缺的领先者。这可能表明加拿大经济正在复苏，但仍因该国持续缺乏工人而受阻——这是预计未来几年移民人数增加的主要驱动因素。	Of note here, is that of the three sectors that led payroll employment growth in December, two of them (Health care and construction) are also leaders in job vacancies in Canada. This is likely an indication that the recovery process is under way for Canada’s economy but continues to be stymied by the persistent lack of workers in the country—a key driver of the rising immigration numbers forecasted in coming years.
	
此外，这些部门报告的就业人数占各自行业就业增长的大部分。这意味着推动加拿大就业增长的部门也是职位空缺最多的部门——进一步表明加拿大没有足够的人数来解决这一劳动力短缺问题。	In addition, the payroll employment reported by each of these sectors made up the bulk of gains in employment for their respective industries. This means that the sectors that are driving growth in Canadian employment are also the ones with the most job vacancies—further suggesting Canada does not have the requisite number of people to address this labour shortage.
	
还有其他理由相信这两个领域将在未来几个月内成为高增长行业。尽管住宅建筑投资在过去几个月有所下降（在 2022 年 7 月至 2022 年 8 月达到高点之后），但非住宅建筑投资在去年持续增长，接近 6 亿加元——这是该行业的一个有希望的迹象，随着加拿大经济活动的全面回升。	There are other reasons to believe that both areas will be high growth sectors in the coming months. Though investment in residential buildings has decreased in the last few months (after a high observed between July and August 2022), non-residential construction investment has seen consistent growth in the last year of close to $600 million CAD—a promising sign for the industry, as economic activity at large picks up in Canada.
	
同样，医疗保健和社会援助是政府不仅投资的一个部门，而且还以优惠的移民政策为后盾，以确保加拿大在该行业拥有所需数量的工人。为了应对日益严重的劳动力短缺，加拿大移民难民和公民部 (IRCC) 最近取消了医生申请快速入境的障碍；提高受过外国培训的医疗专业人员获得认可并在该国工作的能力；并将护理人员永久居留资格的工作经验要求减半——所有这些都是为了应对困扰加拿大这个重要行业的严重劳动力短缺问题。	Similarly healthcare and social assistance is a sector that the government has not just invested in, but also backed with the weight of favorable immigration policies to ensure that Canada has the required number of workers in that industry. In response to growing labour shortages, Immigration Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) has recently removed barriers for physicians to apply for Express Entry; increased the ability of foreign trained medical professionals to become accredited and work in the country; and cut the work experience requirement for permanent residence eligibility for caregivers in half—all in response to the intense labour shortages that plague this vital Canadian industry.
	
### 哪些省份的招聘人数最多？	What provinces saw the most hiring?
	
12 月份的就业人数增长集中在以下省份：	The payroll employment increases observed in December were concentrated in the following provinces:
	
- 魁北克（+8,800 个工作岗位）；	-   Quebec (+8,800 jobs);
- 安大略省（+5,600 个工作岗位）；	-   Ontario (+5,600 jobs);
- 不列颠哥伦比亚省（+4,600 个工作岗位）；	-   British Columbia (+4,600 jobs);
- 艾伯塔省（+3,800 个工作岗位）。	-   Alberta (+3,800 jobs).
	
此外，纽芬兰和拉布拉多报告就业人数略有下降（-100 个工作岗位）。这是在 11 月取得成功之后，[该省能够将职位空缺减少三分之一以上。](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/230126/dq230126a-eng。 htm#:~:text=Job%20vacancies%20decreased%20in%20six%20provinces%20in%20November%2C%20with%20the%20largest%20proportional%20decreases%20in%20Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador%20(%2D35.3% 25%20%C2%A05%2C500))	Additionally, Newfoundland and Labrador reported a slight decrease in payroll employment (-100 jobs). This comes after a successful November, [where the province was able to cut down job vacancies by more than a third.](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/230126/dq230126a-eng.htm#:~:text=Job%20vacancies%20decreased%20in%20six%20provinces%20in%20November%2C%20with%20the%20largest%20proportional%20decreases%20in%20Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador%20(%2D35.3%25%20to%C2%A05%2C500))
	
总体而言，虽然这些就业增长令人鼓舞，但与加拿大为确保其持续的经济健康而需要填补的职位空缺相比，这些增长相对微不足道。	Overall, while these employment increases are encouraging, they are relatively minuscule in relation to the vacancies that Canada would need to fill in the coming months in order to guarantee its continued economic health.
