**Invitation process and cut offs**

The highest ranked clients by points score are invited to apply for the relevant visa. For clients who have equal points scores, the time at which they reached their points score for that subclass (referred to as the visa date of effect) determines their order of invitation. Expressions of Interest with earlier dates of effect are invited before later dates.

<tr>

<th>Visa Subclass</th>

<th>​Points score</th>

<th>Visa date of effect</th>

<tr>

<td>Skilled - Independent (subclass 189)</td>

Due to the continuing high numbers of EOIs received for the below occupations, invitations for these occupations will be issued on a pro rata basis in each monthly invitation round over the 2015-16 programme year. These arrangements are subject to change throughout the programme year.  SkillSelect first allocates available places to Skilled – Independent (subclass 189) visas and then remaining to Skilled – Regional (subclass 489) (Provisional – Family Sponsored) visas. If all places are taken up by subclass 189 visas then there will be no invitations issued for subclass 489 visas in these occupations:

*   ICT Business and Systems Analysts
*   Accountants
*   Software and Applications Programmers.

The points score and the visa date of effect cut-off for the above occupations in the 23 November 2015 invitation round is as follows.  Below points score and visa date of effect is for Skilled Independent (subclass 189).
