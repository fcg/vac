您想联系移民机构但又担心被骗？不要害怕，因为我们有一些有用的提示，可以帮助您识别假冒的移民公司。	Do you want to get in touch with an immigration agency but are worried about being scammed? Fear not, for we have some useful tips on how you can spot a fake immigration company.
	
识别假移民机构的常见指标是什么？	What Are The Common Indicators For Identifying A Fake Immigration Agency?
	
对于那些担心必须经历移民加拿大的艰难过程的前景的申请人来说，遇到骗取您钱财的假移民机构的机会是一个主要问题。	For those applicants who are anxious about the prospect of having to go through the difficult process of immigrating to Canada, the chances of encountering a fake immigration agency that defrauds you of your money is a major concern. 
	
申请人很难应对遇到这种犯罪活动的可能性。通过使用我们之前遇到假移民机构的经验，我们能够编制一份我们认为可以帮助不了解欺诈活动指标的申请人的共性清单。以下是需要注意的重要事项列表。	It is very difficult for applicants to navigate the possibility of encountering this criminal activity. By using our previous experiences with encountering fake immigration agencies, we are able to compile a list of commonalities that we think can assist applicants who are unaware of the indicators of fraudulent activity. Here is a list of the top things to look out for.
	
### 奇怪的电子邮件地址	Strange Email Address
	
信誉良好的移民机构避免使用陌生的电子邮件地址。特别是，以 @gmail.com 而不是 @（组织名称）.org 结尾的电子邮件地址应该被标记为非常可疑。如果您遇到这样一个奇怪的地址，我们建议您要么小心行事并避免泄露敏感信息，要么完全避免使用它	Reputable immigration agencies avoid using strange email addresses. In particular, email addresses that end in @gmail.com instead @(name of organization).org should be flagged as very suspicious. Should you come across such a strange address, we recommend that you either tread carefully and avoid giving away sensitive information or to avoid it entirely
	
### Whatsapp 付款请求	Whatsapp Payment Requests
	
如果您联系的移民机构要求通过聊天应用程序（例如 Whatsapp）处理您的申请，我们建议您停止使用他们的服务。像 Canadianvisa.org 这样的信誉良好的移民公司仅将这些移动聊天应用程序用于通信目的。通过聊天链接的付款请求也应被视为一个主要的危险信号。	If the immigration agency that you’re in contact with requests to process your application via a chat app, for example Whatsapp, we advise that you cease using their services. A reputable immigration company like Canadianvisa.org only uses these mobile chat apps for the purposes of communication. Requests for payment via chat links should also be taken as a major red flag.
	
### 假签证顾问	Fake Visa Consultants
	
假移民机构不提供注册移民律师或受监管的加拿大移民顾问 (RCIC) 的付费服务。如果非法移民机构试图通过 RCIC 冒充其服务信誉良好，则有一种方法可以识别这种欺诈活动。	Fake immigration agencies don’t offer paid services of registered immigration lawyers or Regulated Canadian Immigration Consultants (RCIC). Should an illegitimate immigration agency try to pass off their services as reputable through an RCIC, there is a way to identify this fraudulent activity.
	
只需访问 CCIC 网站，点击“查找移民专家”，然后输入 RCIC 的名称、注册号或公司名称。如果他们的名字没有出现，那么这意味着您可能正在与一家欺诈性移民公司打交道。	 Simply go to the CCIC website, click on Find an Immigration Professional and enter the RCIC’s name, registration number or company name. If their names don’t come up, then that means you are possibly dealing with a fraudulent immigration company.
	
假签证顾问喜欢使用注册码不正确的假 RCIC 注册号。他们使用的图像内容通常已经过时，并且提供的 RCIC 信息也不正确。所有加拿大签证 RCIC 都在 CCIC 注册，并有权代表您。	Fake Visa Consultants like to use fake RCIC registration numbers which have incorrect registration codes. The image content they use is normally outdated and the RCIC information presented is also incorrect. All Canadian Visa RCIC are registered with the CCIC, and are authorized to represent you.
	
除了其他 RCIC 名称之外，您还可以在我们的网站上找到以下信息。请按照上述步骤随意验证他们的凭据。	Below is the info you will find on our site, in addition to the other RCIC names. Feel free to verify their credentials by following the above mentioned steps.

### 网站内容不佳	Poor Website Content
	
在移民局的网站上滚动时，您可能会遇到纯粹策划的、不相关的或不正确的内容。虚假移民公司的一个常见识别特征是 URL 和公司之间的差异。如果这些不匹配，那么您可能正在与欺诈性移民公司打交道。	While scrolling on the immigration agency’s website, you may encounter content that is purely curated, irrelevant or incorrect. One common identifying trait for fake immigration companies is the difference between the URL and the company. If these do not match, then you are possibly dealing with a fraudulent immigration company.

### 山寨网站	Copycat Website
	
很多假移民机构会抄袭整个外观和设计。 Canadiavisa.org 是其中一种用于欺骗申请人的骗局的不幸受害者。作为一个简短的提示，如果您在多个站点上看到完全相同的内容，这通常是一个危险信号。	A lot of fake immigration agencies will plagiarize the entire look and design. Canadiavisa.org was the unfortunate victim of one of these scams used to defraud applicants. As a short tip, If you see the exact same content across multiple sites, this would usually be a red flag. 
	
### 当数字不相加时	When Numbers Don’t Add Up
	
信誉良好的移民公司的联系电话是在他们开展业务的地点或国家/地区注册的。如果与您打交道的移民公司不具备合法性这一重要特征，那么您可能正在与一家虚假的非法公司打交道。	Reputable immigration companies have contact numbers that are registered within the location or countries that they operate out of. If the immigration company that you’re dealing with does not possess this important feature of legitimacy, then you’re probably dealing with a fake illegitimate company.
