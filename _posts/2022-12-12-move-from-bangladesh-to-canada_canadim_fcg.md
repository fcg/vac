长期以来，加拿大一直是孟加拉国国民移民的热门目的地。加拿大计划在未来几年迎来超过 100 万新移民，现在可能正是采取行动的最佳时机！	Canada has long been a popular destination for Bangladeshi nationals to immigrate to. With Canada planning to welcome more than 1 million newcomers in the coming years, now may just be the best time to make the move! 
	
长期以来，加拿大一直是孟加拉国国民的热门目的地。近年来，成为加拿大永久居民的孟加拉国人数一直在增加。根据加拿大统计局的数据，有 100,000 名孟加拉裔加拿大人，大多数居住在多伦多或周边地区。	Canada has long been a popular destination for Bangladeshi nationals. The number of people from Bangladesh who became permanent residents in Canada has been on the rise in recent years. According to Statistics Canada, there are 100,000 Bangladeshi origin Canadians, most living in or around Toronto. 
	
虽然技术工人可能要等上几十年才能在美国获得永久居留权，但加拿大的移民系统允许技术工人在符合项目资格的情况下直接申请永久居留权。如果获得永久居留权，一个人将有权在加拿大任何地方生活和工作，以及获得加拿大全民医疗保健和社会服务的权利。	While a skilled worker could potentially wait decades before obtaining permanent residence in the US, Canada’s immigration system allows skilled workers to apply directly for permanent residence if they qualify for a program. If granted permanent residency, a person is given the right to live and work anywhere in Canada, plus access to Canadian universal healthcare and social services.
	
以下是孟加拉国国民获得加拿大永久居留权的一些最佳方式：	Here are some of the best ways for Bangladeshi  nationals to obtain Canadian permanent residence:
	
**快速通道 – 联邦技术工人**	**Express Entry – Federal Skilled Worker**
	
联邦技术工人 (FSW) 流适用于具有至少一年技术工作经验的人员。它竞争激烈，使用复杂的综合排名系统给所有申请者打分。只有最具竞争力的申请人才会被选中进行移民。	The Federal Skilled Worker (FSW) stream is for those with at least one year of skilled work experience. It is highly competitive, using the complex Comprehensive Ranking System to give all applicants a points-based score. Only the most competitive applicants will be selected for immigration.

**省提名计划 (PNP)**	**Provincial Nominee Programs (PNPs)**
	
加拿大的 13 个省和地区中的每一个都有自己的移民计划，称为省提名计划或 PNP。由于各省有不同的人口和经济，他们的移民计划是独一无二的，旨在满足他们的经济和人口需求。	Each of Canada’s thirteen provinces and territories operates its own immigration programs, called Provincial Nominee Programs, or PNPs. As the provinces have different populations and economies, their immigration programs are unique and built to fit their economic and demographic needs.
	
PNP 是一个受欢迎的选择，因为对于缺乏足够的 CRS 积分来获得 ITA 的候选人来说，它们可能是获得加拿大永久居留权的最快途径。	PNPs are a popular option because they can be the fastest pathway to Canadian permanent residence for candidates that are lacking enough CRS points to receive an ITA.
	
通过省提名计划移民占加拿大经济移民总数的很大一部分。在 2021 年的 232,500 名经济移民中，有 80,800 名是为根据省提名计划申请的人保留的。事实上，与 2020 年相比，2021 年加拿大在 PNP 特定快速通道抽签中发出的邀请数量是 2020 年的三倍。	Immigration through a Provincial Nominee Program makes up a large portion of Canada’s total economic immigration. Of a total of 232,500 economic immigrants targeted for 2021, 80,800 were reserved for those applying under a Provincial Nominee Program. In fact, in 2021, Canada issued three times as many invitations in PNP-specific Express Entry draws compared to 2020.
	
**魁北克技术工人（QSW）**	**Quebec Skilled Worker (QSW)**
	
魁北克省有自己的技术工人移民计划。魁北克技术工人计划 (QSW) 是一项由魁北克省运营的移民计划，面向具有技术工作经验并能够作为劳动力成员为魁北克经济做出持久贡献的候选人。	The province of Quebec runs its own skilled worker immigration program. The Quebec Skilled Worker Program (QSW) is an immigration program operated by the province of Quebec for candidates who have skilled work experience and will be able to make lasting contributions to Quebec’s economy as members of the workforce.
	
与 Express Entry 类似，候选人使用积分系统进行排名，然后邀请某些候选人申请。	Similar to Express Entry, candidates are ranked using a points system and then certain candidates are invited to apply.
	
**工作许可/公司内部调动**	**Work Permits / Intra-Company Transfers**
	
某些孟加拉国国民可能有资格获得加拿大工作许可证。通常，需要工作机会才能获得工作许可。然而，一个重要的例外是公司内部调动。	Certain Bangladeshi nationals may be eligible for a Canadian work permit. Often, a job offer will be required to obtain a work permit. However, one significant exception to this is for intra-company transfers. 
	
如果您的雇主是在加拿大设有办事处的跨国公司的一部分，您可能有资格被调到加拿大的办事处，而无需太多文书工作！	If your employer is part of a multinational corporation with offices in Canada, you may be eligible to be transferred to an office in Canada, without too much paperwork!
	
**家庭赞助**	**Family Sponsorship**
	
如果您有符合条件的亲戚居住在加拿大，您可能有资格获得家庭类别赞助。加拿大提供多种移民计划，让加拿大人有机会担保他们的家人到加拿大。	If you have a qualifying relative living in Canada, you may be eligible for Family Class sponsorship. Canada offers numerous immigration programs that give Canadians the opportunity to sponsor their family members to Canada.

**加拿大留学**	**Study in Canada**
	
越来越多的学生选择在加拿大而不是美国留学。许多孟加拉国国民选择在加拿大学习的原因之一是在学习期间和之后有充足的工作选择。完成加拿大证书后，国际毕业生可以获得许多永久居留移民机会。加拿大的许多移民计划还需要一定的熟练工作经验。幸运的是，加拿大的大多数国际学生毕业生都有资格申请毕业后工作许可，该许可允许国际毕业生在加拿大任何地方工作并获得宝贵的工作经验。	More and more students are choosing to study in Canada over the United States. One of the reasons many Bangladeshi nationals choose to study in Canada is the ample options to work during and after their studies. After completing a Canadian credential, there are many permanent residency immigration opportunities that become available to international graduates. Many of Canada’s immigration programs also require a certain amount of skilled work experience. Fortunately, the majority of international student graduates in Canada are eligible to apply for a post-graduation work permit, This permit allows international graduates to work anywhere in Canada and gain this valuable work experience.
