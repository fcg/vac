加拿大移民、难民和公民部宣布启动一项基础广泛的参与倡议——加拿大未来的移民制度——以探索移民政策和计划如何支持加拿大未来的共同愿景。	Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada has announced the start of a broad-based engagement initiative — An Immigration System for Canada’s Future — to explore how immigration policies and programs can support a shared vision for Canada’s future.
	
该参与倡议标志着持续的全社会协作方法的开始，旨在从广泛的合作伙伴和利益相关者那里获取多样化的观点，包括各级政府、企业、学术界、高等教育机构、定居机构、加拿大的相关部门和客户。	The engagement initiative, which marks the beginning of a continued, whole-of-society collaboration approach, aims to capture a diversity of perspectives from a broad range of partners and stakeholders, including all levels of government, businesses, academia, post-secondary institutions, settlement organizations, implicated sectors in Canada and clients.
	
该倡议将持续整个春季，将包括全国各地的面对面对话会议、专题研讨会和一项公众调查。从这个过程中收集的信息将为加拿大未来的移民政策和计划提供信息，使全国各地的社区在未来几十年受益。	The initiative, which will continue throughout the spring, will include in-person dialogue sessions across the country, thematic workshops and a survey for the public. The input gathered from this process will inform Canada’s future immigration policies and programs, to benefit communities across the country for decades to come.
	
移民部长肖恩·弗雷泽 (Sean Fraser) 于 2023 年 2 月 27 日在哈利法克斯主持了第一次对话会议。会议为部长和与会者提供了一个交流想法和讨论加拿大移民政策和计划如何更好地支持东海岸到西海岸社区需求的机会。	Immigration Minister Sean Fraser chaired the first dialogue session in Halifax on February 27, 2023. The session provided an opportunity for the Minister and participants to exchange ideas and discuss how Canada’s immigration policies and programs can better support the needs of communities from coast to coast.
	
弗雷泽部长表示，“移民对加拿大的长期成功至关重要，我们需要确保我们的政策和计划符合我们社区的需求。这就是加拿大政府发起这项大规模参与倡议的原因，这将为广泛的利益相关者和加拿大人提供机会，就我们如何为加拿大的未来建立一个更强大、更具适应性的移民体系分享他们的想法和观点。 ”	According to Minister Fraser, “Immigration is critical to Canada’s long-term success, and we need to ensure our policies and programs are aligned with the needs of our communities. That’s why the Government of Canada is launching this large-scale engagement initiative, which will provide an opportunity for a wide range of stakeholders and Canadians to share their ideas and perspectives on how we can build a stronger, more adaptive immigration system for Canada’s future.”
	
除了与利益相关者的对话会议和专题研讨会之外，IRCC 还将在 3 月份发起一项调查。这项在线调查为公众提供了一个机会，让他们就加拿大移民的未来分享想法和建议。	IRCC will also be launching a survey in March in addition to the dialogue sessions and thematic workshops with stakeholders. This online survey is an opportunity for the public to share ideas and advice for the future of immigration in Canada.
