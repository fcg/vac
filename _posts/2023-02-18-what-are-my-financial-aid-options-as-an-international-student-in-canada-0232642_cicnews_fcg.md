作为加拿大的国际学生，我有哪些经济援助选择？加拿大的国际学生有专门的奖学金、助学金和贷款，可以帮助他们支付在加拿大学习期间的教育费用。	What are my financial aid options as an international student in Canada? International students in Canada have dedicated scholarships, as well as bursaries and loans that can help them pay for their education while they study in this country.
	
财政援助是加拿大高等教育的重要组成部分。	Financial aid is a big part of the post-secondary education picture across Canada.
	
事实上，经济援助在高等教育中发挥着如此重要的作用，加拿大就业和社会发展部 (ESDC) 每年都会发布一份报告，详细介绍加拿大学生经济援助 (CFSA) 计划的努力和成果。	In fact, financial assistance plays such a prominent role in post-secondary education that Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) releases a report detailing the efforts and results of the Canada Student Financial Assistance (CFSA) program every year.
	
在 2020-2021 年版的年度报告中，ESDC 详细说明“大约 542,000 名学生受益于 32 亿加元的不可偿还加拿大学生助学金，576,000 名学生[利用]40 亿加元的学生贷款。”	In the 2020-2021 version of the annual report, ESDC detailed that “approximately 542,000 students benefited from $3.2 billion in non-repayable Canada Student Grants, and 576,000 students \[took advantage\] of $4.0 billion in student loans.”

值得注意的是，这些赠款在加拿大各地得到了很好的分配，所有 10 个参与的省和地区——不包括魁北克、西北地区和努纳武特——都获得了总价值至少 160 万加元的赠款。	Of note is that these grants were well-distributed across Canada, where all 10 participating provinces and territories — excluding Quebec, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut — received grants valued at a total of at least $1.6 million.
	
尽管如此，尽管加拿大大专学生的经济援助在全国范围内普遍存在，但一种误解不断威胁着该国许多学生的教育之旅。	Still, despite the nationwide prevalence of financial aid for Canadian post-secondary students, one misconception continually threatens to hinder the educational journey for many students in this country.
	
### 作为加拿大的国际学生，我有资格获得经济援助吗？	Am I eligible for financial aid as an international student in Canada?
	
根据加拿大国际教育局 (CBIE) 的数据，2021 年，加拿大接待了“621,565 名各级学习的国际学生”。	In 2021, Canada hosted “621,565 international students at all levels of study”, according to the Canadian Bureau for International Education (CBIE).
	
在这个群体中，有一个误解是国际学生在加拿大学习期间没有经济援助选择。然而，这与现实相去甚远。	Among many in this group, there is a misunderstanding group that international students do not have financial aid options available to them while studying in Canada. However, this is far from reality.
	
尽管他们可能无法获得与国内学生相同的经济援助选择，但国际学生仍然可以获得奖学金、助学金和贷款，以帮助他们支付在加拿大学习的费用。	Although they may not have the same financial aid options available to them as domestic students do, international students still have scholarships, bursaries, and loans that can assist them with the costs of studying in Canada.
	
**注意：** 加拿大国际证书信息中心 (CICIC) 是一个代表加拿大联邦和省/地区政府的委员会。它被认为是国际学生可以用来寻找经济援助选择的权威中心。此 CICIC 页面是加拿大国际学生的良好起点。	**Note:** The Canadian Information Centre for International Credentials (CICIC) is a council that represents federal and provincial/territorial governments in Canada. It is considered an authoritative hub that international students can use to find their financial aid options. This CICIC page is a good starting point for Canadian international students.
	
以下是加拿大国际学生的一些经济援助选择的细目分类。	The following is a breakdown of some financial aid options for international students in Canada.
	
### 作为一名国际学生，我有哪些经济援助选择？	What are my financial aid options as an international student?
	
一般来说，国际学生的经济援助选择分为三个不同的类别：奖学金/助学金、助学金和贷款。在许多这样的情况下，经济援助产品将特定于学生申请学习的学校，每个学校都有不同的申请流程、程序和特定于可用经济援助选项的要求。	Generally, financial aid options for international students fall into three distinct categories: scholarships/grants, bursaries, and loans. In many of these situations, financial aid offerings will be specific to the school at which a student applies for their studies, each with different application processes, procedures, and requirements specific to the available financial assistance options.
	
**奖学金和助学金**	**Scholarships and Grants**
	
这种类型的经济援助是根据学生的学业和/或课外成绩提供给大专学生的。由学校、政府或其他组织提供的奖学金和助学金无需由受助人偿还。	This type of financial aid is given to post-secondary students based on their academic and/or extracurricular achievements. Offered by the schools themselves, governments or other organizations, scholarships and grants do not need to be repaid by the recipient.
	
一些针对国际学生的奖学金机会示例包括安大略省多伦多大学提供的 Lester B. Pearson 国际奖学金计划和不列颠哥伦比亚大学提供的 Karen McKellin 国际明日领袖奖。	A few examples of scholarship opportunities specific to international students include the Lester B. Pearson International Scholarship program offered at Ontario’s University of Toronto and the Karen McKellin International Leader of Tomorrow Award offered at the University of British Columbia.
	
**助学金**	**Bursaries**
	
这种类型的经济援助是根据他们的经济需要提供给大专学生的。换句话说，满足特定经济需求门槛的学生——基于个人收入或父母收入等不同因素——可能会从学校获得不需要偿还的经济支持。在许多情况下，助学金申请者需要接受评估，以验证保证获得此类经济援助的经济需求水平。	This type of financial aid is provided to post-secondary students based on their financial need. In other words, students that meet certain thresholds for economic need — based on different factors such as personal income or parental income, among others — may receive financial support from their schools that they do not need to repay. In many cases, bursary applicants will need to undergo assessments to verify a level of financial need that warrants the receipt of this type of financial assistance.
	
**贷款**	**Loans**
	
顾名思义，贷款是一种财务援助，要求接受者最终根据贷款协议中概述的条款偿还款项。通常，这些贷款协议将涉及特定的利率和还款时间表，所有接受者都必须了解这一点，以避免积累不必要的债务。	Loans, as the name implies, are a type of financial assistance that necessitates the recipient to eventually pay back the money based on the terms outlined in the loan agreement. Often, these loan agreements will involve a specific interest rate and repayment schedule, which all recipients must remain aware of to avoid accumulating unnecessary debt.
	
注意：由于加拿大政府在省级和联邦层面施加的资格要求，国际学生可能需要向银行寻求私人贷款。银行的财政援助可能采取贷款、信贷额度或其他媒介的形式，它们还可能带有特殊的学生特定利率，使国际学生更容易还款。	Note: International students may be required to seek out private loans with banks due to eligibility requirements imposed by the Canadian government both at the provincial and federal levels. Financial assistance from a bank may take the form of a loan, a line of credit or other medium and they may also come with special student-specific interest rates that make repayment easier for international students.
