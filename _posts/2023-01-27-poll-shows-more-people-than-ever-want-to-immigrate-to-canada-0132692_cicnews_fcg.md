民意调查显示比以往任何时候都更多的人想移民到加拿大 盖洛普发布的最新数据显示，加拿大是数百万潜在新移民的首选目的地。	Poll shows more people than ever want to immigrate to Canada Latest data released by Gallup shows Canada is the preferred destination for millions of potential newcomers.
	
在全球分析和咨询公司盖洛普最近的一项民意调查中，加拿大首次成为继美国之后最受潜在新移民欢迎的第二大目的地。这是自 2018 年以来盖洛普首次发布有关该主题的数据。	For the first time, Canada has polled as the second most popular destination for potential newcomers after the United States in the most recent poll by Gallup, a global analytics and advice firm. This is the first time Gallup has released data on this topic since 2018.
	
民意调查显示，到 2021 年，如果有机会，将有 9 亿人永久移居另一个国家。这是自该公司 2011 年开始收集数据以来记录的最高百分比。	The poll says that in 2021, 900 million people would move to another country permanently, given the opportunity. This is the highest percentage recorded since the firm began collecting data in 2011.
	
总体而言，从 2011 年到 2021 年，想要永久移居另一个国家的人数从 12% 跃升至 16%。只有欧盟国家和整个东亚国家的人愿意离开祖国的人数有所减少。	Overall, between 2011 and 2021, there was a jump in the number of people who would like to move to another country permanently from 12% to 16%. Only countries in the European Union and throughout East Asia showed a decrease in those who would like to leave their home country.
	
数据表明，COVID-19 大流行并没有阻止人们迁移的愿望。从大流行病旅行限制开始放宽以来移民恢复的速度来看，这是显而易见的。例如，在 2021-2022 年间，净国际移民超过 100 万美国居民。	The data suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic did not deter people’s desire to migrate. This is evident based on the speed at which migration has resumed since pandemic travel restrictions began to ease. For example, between 2021-2022, net international migration exceeded one million residents in the United States.
	
### 加拿大越来越受欢迎	Canada gaining in popularity
	
在过去五年中，加拿大已成为更受移民欢迎的目的地，2021 年有 8% 的受访者表示他们希望移民加拿大而不是美国。	Canada has become a more popular destination for immigrants over the past five years, with 8% of respondents in 2021 saying they would like to immigrate to Canada instead of the United States.
	
The trend started in 2017, not long after former president Donald Trump was elected.他的反移民立场导致许多人放弃美国作为移民选择而转向其他地方。因此，8% 的潜在移民表示他们会选择加拿大而不是任何其他国家，比 2011 年的 5% 大幅上升。同期，选择美国的移民人数从 22% 下降到 18% %。	The trend started in 2017, not long after former president Donald Trump was elected. His anti-immigration stance caused many to abandon the United States as an immigration option and look elsewhere. As a result, 8% of potential immigrants said they would choose Canada over any other country, a spike from 5% in 2011. During the same period of time, the number of immigrants who would choose the United States dropped to 18% from 22%.
	
即使是 8%，加拿大在移民首选目的地方面仍位居第二。德国、西班牙、法国、英国、澳大利亚和日本都在3-7%之间。	Even at 8%, Canada still sits in the second spot in terms of preferred destinations for immigrants. Germany, Spain, France, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Japan are all between 3-7%.
	
想要离开自己国家的人比例最高的是塞拉利昂，那里有 76% 的受访者表示他们会考虑离开。黎巴嫩的比例第二高，为 63%，超过了阿富汗的 53%。	The highest percentage of people who would like to leave their country was in Sierra Leone, where 76% of respondents said they would consider leaving. Lebanon had the second highest percentage at 63%, outstripping Afghanistan’s 53%.
	
不过，永久移居到另一个国家的人数总体增幅最高的地区是拉丁美洲和加勒比地区，在 2011 年至 2021 年间增长了 19%。超过 45% 的受访者来自洪都拉斯、厄瓜多尔和多米尼加共和国如果有机会，他们会移民。	Still, the region with the highest overall increase in people who would move permanently to another country was Latin America and the Caribbean, which showed a 19% increase between 2011 and 2021. More than 45% of respondents in Honduras, Ecuador and the Dominican Republic would immigrate if they had the opportunity.
	
民意调查指出，想要离开自己祖国的受访者与愿意离开祖国的受访者之间存在差异。许多想要移民的人受到财务、家庭和工作机会等情况的阻碍，永远无法离开自己的国家。	The poll notes that there is a difference between respondents who would like to leave their home country and those who do so. Many people who would like to immigrate are hampered by circumstances such as finances, family, and job opportunities and are never able to leave their country.
	
### 加拿大寻求更多移民	Canada seeking more immigrants
	
加拿大广为人知的移民目标可能是其作为新移民目的地受欢迎的一个因素。	Canada’s well-publicized immigration targets are likely a factor in its popularity as a destination for newcomers.
	
加拿大需要移民来应对劳动力老龄化和全球出生率最低之一造成的长期劳动力短缺。如果没有移民，加拿大就没有足够大的税基来维持医疗保健和教育等社会服务。	Canada needs immigrants to combat a chronic labour shortage caused by an aging workforce and one of the lowest global birth rates. Without immigrants, Canada would not have a large enough tax base to maintain social services such as healthcare and education.
	
作为回应，加拿大每年都会发布一项移民水平计划，该计划为该国计划在特定年份从其任何移民途径欢迎的新永久居民人数设定目标。	In response, each year, Canada releases an Immigration Levels Plan that sets targets for the number of new permanent residents the country plans to welcome from any of its immigration pathways in a given year.
	
2022 年，加拿大迎来了超过 437,000 名永久居民。这一目标在 2023 年设定得更高，达到 465,000 人，到 2025 年每年增加 500,000 人。为实现这些目标，加拿大将需要邀请更多新移民并更快地处理申请。这意味着加拿大可能被视为没有其他国家那么严格的移民程序。	In 2022, Canada welcomed over 437,000 permanent residents. This target is set higher for 2023 to 465,000 and rises as high as 500,000 per year by 2025. To meet these targets, Canada will need to invite more newcomers and process applications more quickly. This means Canada may be seen to have a less stringent immigration process than other countries.
