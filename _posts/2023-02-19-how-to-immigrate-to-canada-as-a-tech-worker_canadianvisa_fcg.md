Canada has been an attractive destination for tech workers from all over the world. With its booming tech industry, Canada is the perfect place to start or further your career in tech. This blog will take you through how to immigrate to Canada as a tech worker, from the benefits of working in Canada's tech industry to the programs available for tech workers in the cities where tech jobs are booming.
	
加拿大是全球科技工作者最向往的目的地之一，原因不言而喻。随着科技产业的蓬勃发展，加拿大是开始或进一步发展科技事业的理想之地。	Canada is one of the most sought-after destinations for tech workers worldwide, and it's easy to understand why. With a thriving tech industry proliferating, Canada is the perfect place to start or further your career in tech.
	
此外，科技工作者还有多种移民途径，包括加拿大快速通道计划、加拿大技术工人计划以及加拿大省提名计划Tech Streams作为加拿大科技工作者的家庭赞助。	In addition, there are various immigration pathways for tech workers, including the Canada Express Entry Program, the Canadian Skilled Worker Program, and the Canadian Provincial Nominee Program Tech Streams as Canadian family sponsorship for tech workers.
	
加拿大蓬勃发展的科技产业为科技工作者提供了许多好处，从高薪和出色的工作与生活平衡到多元化的城市和友好的人民。	Canada's booming tech industry offers many benefits for tech workers, from high salaries and excellent work-life balance to diverse cities and friendly people.
	
此外，加拿大是一些世界上最具创新力的公司的所在地，科技工作者可以在这些公司获得宝贵的工作经验。	Furthermore, Canada is home to some of the world's most innovative companies, and tech workers can gain valuable experience working in these companies.
	
不仅如此，加拿大的城市还提供卓越的生活品质。从充满活力的多伦多和温哥华多元文化城市到落基山脉的迷人自然风光，加拿大的科技工作者可以体验两全其美。此外，加拿大是科技工作者非常安全和热情的目的地，采取了一系列举措来确保新移民的安全和福祉。	Not only that, but Canada's cities also offer an excellent quality of life. From the vibrant multicultural cities of Toronto and Vancouver to the stunning nature of the Rocky Mountains, tech workers in Canada can experience the best of both worlds. In addition, Canada is a very safe and welcoming destination for tech workers, with a range of initiatives in place to ensure the safety and well-being of new immigrants.
	
快速通道	Express Entry
	
!作为技术工作者移民到加拿大	!Immigrate to Canada as a Tech Worker
	
快速入境系统是一项移民计划，允许世界各地的技术工人申请加拿大永久居留权。该计划旨在加快移民程序，使技术工人更容易移居加拿大。	The Express Entry system is an immigration program that allows skilled workers worldwide to apply for permanent residency in Canada. This program is designed to fast-track the immigration process and make it easier for skilled workers to move to Canada.
	
申请人在快速通道门户网站上创建快速通道配置文件。然后他们输入以下信息：	Applicants create an Express Entry profile on the Express Entry web portal. They then enter the following information:
	
*   年龄	  Age
*   婚姻状况	  Marital Status
*   教育程度	  Level of Education
*   工作经验	  Work Experience
	
快速通道系统由三个快速通道程序组成。它们如下：	The Express Entry System is made of three Express Entry Programs. They are as follows:
	
* 联邦技术工人计划 (FSWP)	  The Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP)
* 联邦技术贸易计划 (FSTP)	  The Federal Skilled Trades Program (FSTP)
* 加拿大经验类 (CEC)	  The Canadian Experience Class (CEC)
	
这些项目中的每一个都是专门为不同类型的技术工人设计的。然而，与从事技术工作的人最相关的快速入境计划是 FSW 和 CEC。	Each of these programs is designed specifically for different types of skilled workers. However, the Express Entry Programs that are the most relevant for people working in tech are the FSWPand the CEC.
	
### 联邦技术工人计划	The Federal Skilled Worker Program
	
加拿大技术工人计划是一项针对从事需要大学学位的职业的技术工人的移民计划。	The Canadian Skilled Worker Program is an immigration program for skilled workers working in occupations requiring a university degree.
	
技术人员必须满足特定标准才有资格参加此计划，例如	Tech workers must meet specific criteria to be eligible for this program, such as
	
* 拥有加拿大雇主提供的有效工作机会，	  Having a valid job offer from a Canadian employer,
* 在过去十年中至少有一年的全职、带薪工作经验	  Having at least one year of full-time, paid work experience in the last ten years
* 展示语言能力，以及	  Demonstrating language proficiency, and
* 拥有专上学位或文凭。	  Having a post-secondary degree or diploma.
	
一旦技术人员符合标准并提交了申请，他们将根据综合排名系统进行评估和评分。 IRCC 向得分最高的人颁发加拿大永久居留权申请邀请 (ITA)。 FSWP 是想要移居加拿大并为经济做出贡献的科技工作者的绝佳选择，它是您作为科技工作者移民加拿大的最快方式之一。	Once tech workers have met the criteria and submitted their application, they will be assessed and given a score based on the Comprehensive Ranking System. IRCC presents those with the highest scores with Invitations to Apply (ITA's) for permanent residency in Canada. The FSWP is an excellent option for tech workers who want to move to Canada and contribute to the economy, and it is one of the fastest ways you can immigrate to Canada as a tech worker.
	
### 加拿大经验班 (CEC)	The Canadian Experience Class (CEC)
	
随着该国已成为全球科技工作者的首选目的地，加拿大的科技移民正在迅速增长。技术工人的 CEC 使国际工人更容易在加拿大申请永久居留权。	Canada's tech immigration is growing rapidly as the country has become a top destination for tech workers worldwide. The CEC for tech workers makes it easier for international workers to apply for permanent residency in Canada.
	
CEC 是一项快速移民计划，使在加拿大生活和工作的科技工作者更容易成为永久居民。在过去三年中在加拿大生活和工作至少一年的科技工作者可能有资格申请 CEC。它旨在帮助技术工人从加拿大的临时居留权过渡到永久居留权。	The CEC is a fast-track immigration program that makes it easier for tech workers living and working in Canada to become permanent residents. Tech workers who have lived and worked in Canada for at least a year in the past three years may be eligible to apply for the CEC. It is designed to help skilled workers transition from temporary to permanent residence in Canada.
	
申请 CEC 的技术人员必须证明他们具备为加拿大经济做出贡献所需的技能和经验。他们还必须证明自己的语言能力才能在加拿大工作和生活。与 FSWP 一样，加拿大政府在评估申请时会考虑各种因素，包括年龄、教育程度、工作经验和语言能力。	Tech workers who apply for the CEC must demonstrate that they have the skills and experience required to contribute to Canada's economy. They must also show their language proficiency to work and live in Canada. Like the FSWP, the Canadian government looks at various factors, including age, education, work experience, and language proficiency, when assessing applications.
	
CEC 是科技工作者安家加拿大的绝佳机会。通过 CEC，科技工作者可以获得加拿大的永久居留权，并获得该国广泛的科技工作。加拿大拥有蓬勃发展的科技产业，CEC 使科技工作者更容易在加拿大安家。	The CEC is a great opportunity for tech workers to make Canada their home. With access to the CEC, tech workers can gain permanent residence in Canada and access the country's wide range of tech jobs. Canada is home to a thriving tech industry, and the CEC makes it easier for tech workers to make Canada their home.
	
省提名计划技术流	Provincial Nominee Program Tech Streams
	
!省提名计划	!Provincial Nominee Programs
	
由于加拿大是世界上最大的国家之一，加拿大各省和地区都创建了自己独立的永久居留计划，称为省提名计划 (PNP)。每个 PNP 旨在满足每个省特定劳动力市场的需求。此外，每个 PNP 被分成几个较小的 PNP 流，以迎合每个省的不同行业。因此，某些省份有特定的技术流。	Due to Canada being one of the largest countries in the world, the Canadian provinces and territories have created their own separate permanent residency programs called the Provincial Nominee Programs (PNPs). Each PNP is designed to fulfill the needs of the specific labour markets for each province. In addition, each PNP is split into several smaller PNP streams to cater to the different industries of each province. As a result, certain provinces have specific tech streams.
	
加拿大 PNP 技术流如下：	The Canadian PNP tech streams are as follows:
	
* 艾伯塔加速技术途径	  Alberta Accelerated Tech Pathway
* 不列颠哥伦比亚省技术试点	  British Columbia Tech Pilot
* 安大略省技术试点	  Ontario Tech Pilot
	
除此之外，多个技术工人流仍然对技术工人开放。但是，要确定您是否有资格参加任何这些计划，最好查看每个省需要哪些工作。为帮助您找到最适合您的机会以及加拿大最适合您的地方，请参阅下面的地图。	On top of these, multiple Skilled worker streams remain open to tech workers. However, to determine your eligibility for any of these programs, it's best to look at which jobs are in demand in each province. To help you find the best opportunities for you and where the best place in Canada for you is, consult the map below.
	
要有资格参加该计划，您必须满足特定标准，例如拥有加拿大雇主提供的有效工作机会、证明语言能力以及拥有专上学位或文凭。这里有一份关于在加拿大申请工作的便捷指南，以便您尽快开始您的旅程。	To be eligible for the program, you must meet particular criteria, such as having a valid job offer from a Canadian employer, demonstrating language proficiency, and having a post-secondary degree or diploma. Here's a handy guide on applying for jobs in Canada so you can start your journey as soon as possible.

加拿大科技工作者家庭担保	Canadian Family Sponsorship for Tech Workers
	
如果您是一名科技工作者，在加拿大有近亲、配偶或同居伴侣，您可能有资格获得家庭担保。此外，加拿大家庭担保允许有家庭成员居住在加拿大的国际人士申请永久居留权。	If you are a tech worker with close family members, a spouse or a common-law partner in Canada, you may be eligible for family sponsorship. In addition, Canadian family sponsorship allows internationals with family members living in Canada to apply for permanent residency.
	
虽然这可能不是专门针对科技工作者的，但如果您不符合快速入境计划或 PNP 的资格，这是获得加拿大永久居留权的绝佳方式。	While this may not be specifically for tech workers, it is a fantastic way to get your permanent residency in Canada if you don't qualify for an Express Entry program or PNP.
	
要获得此计划的资格，您必须在加拿大有合格的担保人等着您。该赞助商必须是：	To be eligible for this program, you must have an eligible sponsor waiting for you in Canada. This sponsor must be:
	
* 18岁以上	  Over 18 years old
* 加拿大公民或永久居民	  A Canadian Citizen or permanent resident
* 守法公民，无犯罪记录	  A law-abiding citizen with no criminal record
* 拥有足够的资金来担保您在加拿大期间	  In possession of enough money to sponsor you while you're in Canada
	
您可以通过以下方式获得赞助：	You can be sponsored by your:
	
*   配偶	  Spouse
* 同居伴侣或婚姻伴侣	  Common-law or conjugal partner
*   父母	  Parents
* 祖父母	  Grandparents
*   孩子们	  Children
* 孙辈	  Grandchildren
*   兄弟姐妹	  Siblings
* 其他近亲	  Other close blood relatives
	
加拿大家庭担保对于想要移居加拿大并与家人团聚而无需在加拿大找到工作或满足其他加拿大永久居留计划的严格资格标准的科技工作者来说是一个很好的选择。	Canadian family sponsorship is a great option for tech workers who want to move to Canada and reunite their family members without having to land a job in Canada or fulfill the stringent eligibility criteria of the other Canadian permanent residency programs.
	
在这里了解您如何有资格获得加拿大的家庭赞助。	Find out how you can qualify for family sponsorship in Canada here.
	
工作准证	Work Permit
	
如果您是来自加拿大境外的技术工作者并想在加拿大工作，您必须申请加拿大工作许可。加拿大工作许可证允许您在工作合同期限内在加拿大生活和工作。然而，它并没有为您提供与永久居民相同的权利，如果您的工作合同终止，您可能不得不返回您的祖国。	If you are a tech worker from outside of Canada and want to work in Canada, you must apply for a Canadian work permit. A Canadian work permit allows you to live and work in Canada for the length of your job contract. However, it doesn't afford you the same rights as permanent residents, and if your work contract ends, you will likely have to return to your home country.
	
要获得工作许可资格，您必须有指定的加拿大雇主提供的有效工作机会，并且您必须能够证明自己的语言能力。	To be eligible for a work permit, you must have a valid job offer from a designated Canadian employer, and you must be able to demonstrate language proficiency.
	
获得工作许可后，您就可以开始在加拿大工作。对于想要搬到加拿大并立即开始工作的科技工作者来说，工作许可证是一个很好的选择。获得加拿大工作许可也为获得加拿大永久居留权提供了绝佳机会，例如 CEC。	Once you have a work permit, you can start working in Canada. A work permit is an excellent option for tech workers who want to move to Canada and start working immediately. Getting a Canadian work permit also opens up great opportunities to gain permanent residency in Canada, like the CEC.
	
这是有关如何获得加拿大工作许可的完整细目。	Here's a full breakdown of how to get your Canadian work permit.
	
然而，驾驭加拿大移民程序有时会很复杂和令人困惑。要克服的最大障碍之一是确保您有资格参加所选课程。没有人愿意将他们所有的文件放在一起并为在加拿大的生活做准备，结果却发现由于技术原因他们不能去那里。确保不会发生这种情况的最佳方法之一是咨询经过认证的移民专家，例如受监管的加拿大移民顾问 (RCIC)。	However, navigating the Canadian immigration process can sometimes be complex and confusing. One of the biggest hurdles to overcome is ensuring eligibility for your chosen program. No one wants to get all their documentation together and prepare for life in Canada only to find that they can't go there because of a technicality. One of the best ways to ensure this doesn't happen is to consult a certified immigration expert like a Regulated Canadian Immigration Consultant (RCIC).
	
RCIC 可以为您提供完整的评估和专业建议，帮助您以正确的方式开始您的加拿大之旅。	An RCIC can give you a complete evaluation and professional advice on how to start your Canadian journey the right way.
