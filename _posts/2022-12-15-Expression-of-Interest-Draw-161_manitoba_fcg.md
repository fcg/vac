### 笔记	Notes

1. 如果你的分数高于排名最低的候选人，但你还没有收到申请通知书，这可能是因为：	1.If your score is higher than that of the lowest-ranked candidate but you have not received a Letter of Advice to Apply, this could be because:
* 您已表明您已参加经批准的第三方语言测试以证明您的英语/法语语言能力，但未在您的意向书中提供**有效的测试编号**或您的语言测试**不再有效**;或者	* you have indicated that you have taken an approved third-party language test to demonstrate your language ability in English/French, but have not provided a **valid Test Number** in your EOI or your language test is **no longer valid**; or
* 您已表示您已收到根据战略招聘计划申请 MPNP 的邀请，但未提供 **有效的邀请编号**。	* you have indicated that you have received an Invitation to Apply to the MPNP under a Strategic Recruitment Initiative, but did not provide a **valid Invitation Number**.
* 请注意，对于 EOI 中的每个问题，都有帮助文本可用，其中提供了有关您应输入的信息的详细信息。如果这些情况之一适用于您，您可能希望使用正确的信息更新您的 EOI，以便考虑从 EOI 池中进行下一次抽签。	* Please note that for each question in the EOI, help text is available, providing detailed information on the information you should enter. If one of these scenarios applies to you, you may wish to update your EOI with the correct information in order to be considered for the next draw from the EOI pool.
2. 表示自己从事受监管职业并获得在曼尼托巴省工作的完全许可的候选人已在本次抽签中被选中。但是，MPNP 可能不接受或可能拒绝那些实际上没有从事受监管职业和/或未能提供证明已完成在曼尼托巴省工作的所有必要许可步骤的候选人的全部申请。 **如果这适用于您，您不妨考虑拒绝您的申请通知书。**	2.Candidates who indicated they are working in a regulated occupation and are fully licensed to work in Manitoba have been selected in this draw. However, the MPNP may not accept or may refuse full applications from those candidates who are not actually working in a regulated occupation and/or fail to provide proof of having undergone all necessary licensing steps to be employed in Manitoba. **If this applies to you, you may wish to consider declining your Letter of Advice to Apply.**
