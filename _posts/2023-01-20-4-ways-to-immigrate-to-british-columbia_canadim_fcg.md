对于许多人来说，移民到加拿大令人叹为观止的西部成本是梦想成真。不列颠哥伦比亚省拥有风景如画的自然风光和繁华的城市景观，可以为该省的新移民提供很多便利。	For many, immigrating to the breath-taking west cost of Canada is a dream come true. With it’s picturesque nature and landscapes to it’s bustling cities, British Columbia has a lot to offer newcomers to the province.
	
去年，近 45,000 名新移民在不列颠哥伦比亚省定居。如果您正在寻找今年可以成为该数字一部分的方法，请继续阅读以了解我们关于 4 种移居不列颠哥伦比亚省的方法的建议。	Last year nearly 45,000 newcomers made British Columbia their home. If you are looking for ways that you could be part of that number this year, read on to see our recommendation for 4 ways to move to British Columbia.
	
您是否有资格移民到不列颠哥伦比亚省？	Do you qualify to immigrate to British Columbia?
	
**1\.快速通道**	**1\. Express Entry**
	
加拿大使用在线快速通道系统来管理三个主要经济项目的申请。凭借 6 个月的服务标准处理，Express Entry 也是最快和最受欢迎的移民艾伯塔省的方式。	Canada uses the online Express Entry system to manage applications for three main economic programs. With a 6-month service standard processing, Express Entry is also the fastest and most popular way to immigrate to Alberta.
	
联邦技术工人计划是由快速入境系统管理的计划之一，不需要任何以前在艾伯塔省或加拿大的经验。	The Federal Skilled Worker program is one of the programs managed by the Express Entry system that doesn’t require any previous experience in Alberta or Canada.
	
联邦技术工人计划使用 CRS 评分系统根据候选人的 CRS 分数对候选人进行排名。排名基于候选人的年龄、教育程度、语言能力和工作经验。	The Federal Skilled Worker program uses the CRS scoring system to rank candidates against one another based on their CRS score. Rankings are based on candidates age, education, language proficiency, and employment experience.
	
加拿大政府随后举行快速通道抽签，邀请最具竞争力的候选人移民加拿大。预计到 2023 年将有近 83,000 名联邦技术工人来到加拿大，与往年相比有所增加。	The Canadian government then holds Express Entry draws, inviting the most competitive candidates to immigrate to Canada. Nearly 83,000 Federal Skilled Workers are expected to be welcomed to Canada in 2023, an increase compared to previous years.
	
通过快速通道移民的候选人还可以在同一申请中包括他们的配偶或同居伴侣以及受抚养子女。	Candidates who immigrate through Express Entry can also include their spouse or common-law partner, and dependent children in the same application.
	
**2\。不列颠哥伦比亚省提名计划 (BC PNP)**	**2\. The British Columbia Provincial Nominee Program (BC PNP)**
	
不列颠哥伦比亚省提名计划 (BC PNP) 是一项省提名计划 (PNP)，允许不列颠哥伦比亚省提名个人获得加拿大永久居留权。	The British Columbia Provincial Nominee Program (BC PNP)  is a Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) that allows British Columbia  to nominate individuals for Canadian permanent residence.
	
BC PNP 有几个不同的类别，每个类别都有自己独特的资格标准和申请程序。	The BC PNP operates several different streams, each with its own unique eligibility criteria and application procedure.
	
例如，如果您想来 BC 从事技术领域的工作，您可以通过 BC PNP Tech stream 申请。自 2017 年成立以来，已有超过 6,000 名科技工作者被提名为永久居留权。BC PNP Tech stream 举办有针对性的技术抽签，让科技工作者优先选择。	For example, if you’d like to come to BC to work in the tech field, you can apply through the BC PNP Tech stream. Over 6,000 tech workers have been nominated for permanent residence under this stream since its founding in 2017. The BC PNP Tech stream holds targeted tech-only draws to give tech workers priority in selection. 
	
BC 技能移民流是从加拿大境外申请的技术工人的理想选择。 BC 技能移民类别包括许多类别，包括 BC 技术工人、BC 卫生保健专业人员、BC 国际毕业生、BC 国际研究生以及 BC 入门级和半熟练工人。大多数这些流要求工人在申请 BC 技能移民流之前有工作机会。但是，工作机会不需要 LMIA 被视为对该流有效。	The BC Skills Immigration Stream is ideal for skilled workers applying from outside of Canada. There are many streams that make up the BC Skills Immigration stream including, BC Skilled Worker, BC Health Care Professionals, BC International Graduates, BC International Post-Graduate, and BC Entry-Level and Semi-Skilled Workers. Most of these streams require workers to have a job offer before applying to the BC Skills Immigration Stream. However, the job offer does not require an LMIA to be considered valid for this stream.
	
BC 技能移民的候选人必须通过 BC PNP Online 进行注册，BC PNP Online 是管理技能移民注册系统 (SIRS) 的门户网站。该在线系统管理 BC PNP 申请的录取、排名和申请。	Candidates for BC Skills Immigration must register through BC PNP Online, the web portal managing the Skills Immigration Registration System (SIRS). This online system manages the intake, ranking, and applications for BC PNP applications. 
	
如果您满足为其中一个流提交个人资料的要求，进入候选人库将使您有机会收到邀请。	If you meet the requirements to submit a profile for one of these streams, entering the pool of candidates will give you the chance to receive an invitation.
	
**3\。在不列颠哥伦比亚省学习**	**3\. Studying in British Columbia**
	
改善不列颠哥伦比亚省移民选择的一个好方法是在加拿大完成高等教育。在加拿大完成大专学历的候选人更有机会收到邀请，通过快速通道申请提名。	A good way to improve your options for British Columbia  immigration is to complete post-secondary studies in Canada. Candidates who complete a post-secondary credential in Canada have a higher chance of receiving an invitation to apply for nomination through the Express Entry stream.
	
完成加拿大教育证书还可以为您提供额外的 CRS 积分，从而增加您进入快速通道池的机会。	Completing a Canadian education credential can also give you extra CRS points, increasing your chances in the Express Entry pool.
	
大多数从加拿大专上课程毕业的国际学生都可以申请研究生工作许可 (PGWP)。 PGWP 允许国际毕业生留在加拿大并为任何雇主工作长达三年。获得加拿大工作经验对永久移民极为有利，使申请人在快速通道的加拿大经验类（CEC）中更具竞争力。	Most international students who graduate from a Canadian post-secondary program can apply for a Post-Graduate Work Permit (PGWP). The PGWP allows international graduates to stay in Canada and work for up to three years for any employer. Gaining Canadian work experience is extremely advantageous for permanent immigration, making applicants much more competitive in Express Entry’s Canadian Experience Class (CEC).
	
不列颠哥伦比亚省拥有多所著名大学，其中多所大学位列加拿大前十名。	The province of British Columbia is home to many prestigious universities, many of which rank among the top ten universities in Canada.
	
如果您有兴趣在继续接受教育的同时改善您的加拿大移民选择，那么在不列颠哥伦比亚省学习是一个不错的选择。	If you are interested in continuing your education while also improving your Canadian immigration options, studying in British Columbia is a great option.
	
**4\。在不列颠哥伦比亚省工作**	**4\. Working in British Columbia**
	
获得加拿大工作经验是提高您移民到不列颠哥伦比亚省的机会的好方法。	Gaining Canadian work experience is a great way to improve your chances to be able to immigrate to British Columbia.
	
虽然获得加拿大工作许可证可能具有挑战性，但对于那些想在不列颠哥伦比亚省工作的人来说，有一些选择。	Though obtaining a Canadian work permit can be challenging, there are a few options for those who want to work in British Columbia.
	
首先，从不列颠哥伦比亚省的雇主那里获得专业职位的工作机会可以让您申请工作许可。要符合资格，雇主必须首先获得积极的劳动力市场影响评估 (LMIA)，表明他们无法找到加拿大永久居民或公民来填补该职位。根据您的工作经验或国籍，获得 LMIA 的过程可能会容易得多，甚至不需要。	Firstly, gaining a job offer from a British Columbian employer for a specialized position can enable you to apply for a work permit. To be eligible, the employer must first obtain a positive Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA), indicating that they could not find a Canadian permanent resident or citizen to fill the position. Depending on your work experience or your country of citizenship, the process of obtaining an LMIA may be much easier or not even be needed.
	
其次，如果您在一家在加拿大设有办事处的国际公司工作，您可以与您的雇主商谈是否调到加拿大办事处。公司内部调动有时不需要 LMIA，这样更容易获得加拿大工作许可。	Secondly, if you work for an international corporation that has offices in Canada, you can speak to your employer about transferring to a Canadian office. Intra-company transfers are sometimes exempt from requiring an LMIA, which makes it easier to secure a Canadian work permit.
