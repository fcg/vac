您有资格获得配偶担保吗？加拿大公民和永久居民可以担保他们的配偶或伴侣获得加拿大永久居留权。	Are you eligible for spousal sponsorship? Canadian citizens and permanent residents can sponsor their spouses or partners to obtain permanent residence in Canada.

为了担保您的配偶或伴侣，您必须：	In order to sponsor your spouse or partner, you must:
	
* 至少 18 岁	  At least 18 years of age
* 是居住在加拿大的加拿大永久居民或加拿大公民	  Be a Canadian permanent resident living in Canada or a Canadian citizen
* 未入狱、破产、被驱逐令（如果是永久居民）或被控犯有严重罪行；和	  Not be in prison, bankrupt, under a removal order (if a permanent resident) or charged with a serious offence; and
* 在过去 5 年内没有作为配偶被担保到加拿大	  Not have been sponsored to Canada as a spouse within the last 5 years
	
此外，被担保人必须至少年满 16 岁，并且与担保人的血缘关系不能太近。	In addition, the sponsored person must be at least 16 years of age and not be too closely related by blood to the sponsor.
	
担保人和被担保人还必须证明他们的关系，这种关系必须属于以下三类之一：	The sponsor and the sponsored person must also prove their relationship, which must fall under one of three categories:
	
* **配偶：**被担保人和担保人合法结婚。如果婚姻在加拿大境内举行，省或地区的结婚证书足以证明婚姻有效。如果婚姻在加拿大境外举行，则必须根据该国法律以及加拿大联邦法律有效。	  **Spouse:** the sponsored person and sponsor are legally married. If the marriage took place within Canada, a Certificate of Marriage from the province or territory is sufficient to prove that the marriage is valid. If the marriage took place outside Canada, it must be valid under the laws of that country and as well as under Canadian federal law.
* **同居伴侣：被担保人和担保人必须连续同居至少一年。	  **Common law partne**r: the sponsored person and sponsor must cohabit continuously for at least one year.
* **婚姻伴侣**：如果受担保人无法控制的特殊情况使伴侣无法成为普通法伴侣或配偶，例如移民障碍或有限离婚或同性关系的法律限制，则被担保人可被定义为婚姻伴侣.此外，合作伙伴必须处于至少一年的相互依赖关系中，并且具有与婚姻或同居伴侣关系相同的承诺水平。这可以通过情感纽带、亲密关系、财务紧密度（例如资产的共同所有权）以及花时间在一起和团聚的努力来证明。	  **Conjugal partner**: a sponsored person may be defined as a conjugal partner if exceptional circumstances beyond their control has prevented the partners from qualifying as common law partners or spouses, such as immigration barriers or legal restrictions limited divorce or same sex relationships. Furthermore, the partners must be in a mutually dependent relationship for a least one years with the same level of commitment as a marriage or common law partnership. This can be demonstrated through emotional ties, intimacy, financial closeness such as joint ownership of assets and efforts to spend time together and reunite.
	
重要的是要注意，在加拿大境内进行的同性婚姻对于配偶担保和普通法是有效的，并且夫妻伴侣可以是同性。	It is important to note that same-sex marriages performed within Canada are valid for spousal sponsorship and common law and conjugal partners can be same-sex.

* 尚未支付移民贷款、履约保证金和/或家庭抚养费；	  have not paid an immigration loan, a performance bond and/or family support payments;
