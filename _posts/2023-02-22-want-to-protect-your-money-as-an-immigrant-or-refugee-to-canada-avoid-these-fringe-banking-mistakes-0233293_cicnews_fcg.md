受联邦政府监管，加拿大的银行系统被认为是世界上最安全和最稳定的银行系统之一。	Regulated by the federal government, Canada’s banking system is considered among the world’s safest and most stable.
	
然而，移民和难民有时会发现自己被加拿大的边缘金融服务机构利用，例如发薪日贷款公司、支票兑现网点、快速退税网点或典当行。结果，他们可能会因这些组织的高昂费用和高利率而失去辛苦赚来的收入。	However, immigrants and refugees can sometimes find themselves being taken advantage of by fringe financial services in Canada like payday loan companies, cheque-cashing outlets, rapid-refund tax outlets or pawn shops. As a result, they can lose their hard-earned income to the exorbitant fees and high-interest rates of these organizations.
	
Windmill Microlending 是一家加拿大慈善机构，专门致力于帮助技术移民和难民支付他们在新国家的认证、培训、认证和专业发展的费用，它知道我们的客户希望做出最佳的财务决策。但了解加拿大金融体系的细微差别可能需要时间，包括了解边缘银行和贷方的风险。	Windmill Microlending, a Canadian charity focusing exclusively on helping skilled immigrants and refugees pay for the costs of accreditation, training, certification and professional development, in their new country, knows our clients want to make the best financial decisions possible. But it can take time to learn the nuances of the Canadian financial system, including understanding the risks of fringe banks and lenders.
	
使用边缘金融服务的费用通常比在传统银行或信用合作社支付的费用高得多。下面，您将找到需要注意的金融服务类型示例以及需要考虑的替代方案。	Using fringe financial services can often cost much more than the fees paid at a traditional bank or credit union. Below, you’ll find examples of the types of financial services to watch out for and alternatives to consider.

**支票兑现网点**	**Cheque-Cashing Outlets**
--------------------------	--------------------------
	
**他们的工作：**如果您没有银行账户，则兑现支票，通常收取一定比例的支票外加服务费。例如，对于一张 1,000 美元的支票，他们可以收取 3% 的手续费（30 美元）加上 3 美元的服务费，总费用为 33 美元。	**What they do:** Cash cheques if you do not have a bank account, usually charging a percentage of your cheque plus a service fee. For example, on a $1,000 cheque they could charge a 3% fee ($30) plus a $3 service fee for a total charge of $33.
	
**可供考虑的替代方案：**提供存款、取款和支票书写权限的基本银行账户。 1,500 美元以下的联邦政府支票可凭身份证免费兑现。	**Alternative to consider: **A basic bank account providing deposit, withdrawal and cheque writing privileges. Federal government cheques under $1,500 can be cashed, with ID, for no charge.
	
**发薪日贷款**	**Payday Loans**
------------------	----------------
	
**他们的工作：**由私人贷方和支票兑现网点提供，他们提供 2-4 周的短期贷款以抵消您的下一份薪水。您最多可以借下一笔薪水支票金额的 50%。发薪日贷款是非常昂贵的借钱方式，因为它们需要支付高额的服务费和利息。如果您不按时偿还贷款，这些费用会更高。例如，如果您的薪水为 1,000 美元，您可以从发薪日贷款服务中借入 500 美元，但最终可能需要支付双倍或更多费用，包括利息和其他费用，具体取决于贷款条款。	**What they do: **Offered by private lenders and cheque-cashing outlets, they provide short-term loans of 2-4 weeks against your next paycheque. You can borrow up to 50 per cent of your next paycheque amount. Payday loans are very expensive ways to borrow money as they have high service fees and interest charges. These get even higher if you do not pay the loan back on time. For example, if you earn $1,000 on your paycheque, you can borrow $500 from a payday loan service but could end up paying double that or more, with interest and other fees, depending on loan terms.
	
**可供考虑的备选方案：**尝试使用您的紧急储备金或储蓄账户中的资金，或询问如何从家人或朋友那里获得贷款。您也可以从银行或信用合作社获得贷款。如果它用于支付认证、教育或培训的费用，您可以从 Windmill Microlending 获得一个。	**Alternative to consider: **Try using money from your emergency reserves or savings account or inquire about securing a loan from a family member or friend. You may also be able to get a loan from your bank or credit union. If it is to be used for costs of accreditation, education or training you can get one from Windmill Microlending.
	
**快速退税服务**	**Rapid-Refund Tax Services**
------------------------------	-----------------------------
	
**他们的工作：**他们提供“即时退款”，但这些不是退税。它们是非常昂贵的贷款。他们对服务收取高额费用，包括准备费、电子申请费、支票兑现费和贷款费。这些费用加起来可能高达数百美元。您会立即获得退款金额，减去手续费。政府然后将您的退税发送给还清您贷款的服务。	**What they do: **They provide “instant refunds,” but these are not tax refunds. They are very expensive loans. They charge high fees for services, including preparation fees, electronic filing fees, cheque cashing fees and loan charges. These fees can add up to hundreds of dollars. You get a refund amount right away, less the fees. The government then sends your tax refund to the service which pays off your loan.
	
**可供考虑的替代方案：**在您的银行账户中直接存入一笔用于退税的款项。使用免费的慈善社区税务诊所获得支持，以尽可能高效和经济地接收退税。	**Alternative to consider: **Arrange a direct deposit in your bank account for your tax refund. Use free charitable community tax clinics for support in receiving your tax refund as efficiently and economically as possible.
	
**当铺**	**Pawn Shops**
--------------	--------------
	
**他们的工作：**贷款现金以换取贵重物品，例如珠宝和电子产品。这些对象是“抵押品”。如果您偿还贷款，您将取回物品。如果您不这样做，典当行会保留该物品并将其出售给其他人。这些企业收取高利率和费用。	**What they do:  **Loan cash in exchange for valuable objects, such as jewelry and electronics. These objects are “collateral”. If you repay the loan, you get the object back. If you don’t, the pawn shop keeps the item and sells it to someone else. These businesses charge high-interest rates and fees.
	
**可供考虑的替代方案：**从其他来源寻找您需要的资金，例如家人、朋友、应急基金和政府补助金。	**Alternative to consider: **Look to other sources for the money you need such as family, friends, emergency funds and government grants.
	
了解这些边缘银行服务以及避免它们的替代方案，可以帮助您作为加拿大新移民做出明智和安全的银行决策。这也可以帮助您避免高利率、隐藏费用并保护您的资金。	Learning about these fringe banking services, and alternatives to avoid them, can help you make smart and safe banking decisions as a newcomer to Canada. This can also help you avoid high interest rates, hidden fees and protect your money.
