作为加拿大的新移民，您可能需要了解的一件重要事情是加拿大的税收制度；包括提交纳税申报表的过程。	As a newcomer to Canada, one important thing you may need to learn about is the Canadian tax system; including the process of filing a tax return.
	
纳税申报单是您向加拿大税务局 (CRA) 提交的文件，报告您在给定纳税年度的收入、扣除额和抵免额。提交纳税申报表很重要，因为它决定了您是否有资格获得某些福利、抵免和退款，以及您的纳税义务。	A tax return is a document that you file with the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) that reports your income, deductions, and credits for a given tax year. Filing a tax return is important because it determines your eligibility for certain benefits, credits, and refunds, as well as your tax liability.
	
在本文中，我们将讨论什么是纳税申报表、为什么您可能需要提交一份纳税申报表以及如何着手进行。	In this article, we will discuss what a tax return is, why you may need to file one, and how to go about doing it.

## **为什么要在加拿大报税？**	**Why file a tax return in Canada?**
	
所以，您刚刚抵达加拿大——或计划很快抵达。也许您想知道为什么您可能需要作为新移民提交一份。即使您一年中只在加拿大居住了部分时间，如果您有工作收入、投资收入或其他收入，并且有欠税，或者如果您想申请退税，您可能需要提交纳税申报表。[\[ 1\]](#_ftn1) 提交纳税申报表还可以让您申请您可能有资格获得的福利和抵免，例如加拿大儿童福利金或 GST/HST 抵免。	So, you have just arrived in Canada – or plan to soon. Perhaps you are wondering why you may need to file one as a newcomer. Even if you only lived in Canada for part of the year, you may need to file a tax return if you earned income such as employment, investment or other income, and have tax owing or if you want to claim a refund.[\[1\]](#_ftn1) Filing a tax return may also allow you to claim benefits and credits that you may be eligible for, such as the Canada Child Benefit or the GST/HST credit.
	
## **纳税申报的截止日期是什么时候？**	**What is the deadline for tax returns?**
	
提交纳税申报表的截止日期是每年的 4 月 30 日；但是，如果 4 月 30 日是周末，则可以延长到下一个工作日。[\[2\]](#_ftn2) 如果您或您的配偶或同居伴侣是自雇人士，则提交截止日期为6 月 15 日。但是，如果您有纳税义务，您的付款应在 4 月 30 日到期。	The deadline for filing your tax return is April 30th of each year; however, when April 30th falls on a weekend, there is an extension to the next business day.[\[2\]](#_ftn2) If you or your spouse or common-law partner is self-employed, the filing deadline is June 15th. However, if you have a tax liability, your payment is due April 30.
	
## **如何在加拿大报税？**	**How do I file a tax return in Canada?**
	
提交纳税申报表的方式有多种，包括纸质提交或使用经过认证的税务软件进行电子提交。一种简单方便的申报方式是通过 CRA 的网站使用“我的账户”功能。如果您更喜欢纸质申报，您可以从 CRA 网站在线订购包裹或致电 CRA 1-855-330-3305。	There are several ways to file your tax return, including paper filing or e-filing using certified tax software. One easy and convenient way to file is through the CRA’s website using the “My Account” feature. If you prefer paper filing, you can order the package online from the CRA website or by calling the CRA at 1-855-330-3305.
	
## **需要个人、工作和财务信息[\[3\]](#_ftn3)**	**Personal, work, and financial information required[\[3\]](#_ftn3)**
	
您将需要提供个人信息，例如您的姓名、地址和社会保险号码。如果您已婚或同居，您还需要提供伴侣的信息。	You will need to provide personal information such as your name, address, and social insurance number. If you are married or in a common-law relationship, you will also need to provide your partner’s information.
	
## **纳税申报表所需的其他信息**	**Additional Information you will need for your tax return**
	
要提交您的申报表，您将需要提供有关您在税单上找到的收入的其他信息，例如您的 T4（已付报酬报表）、T3（信托收入分配和指定报表）和 T5（投资收入报表）。您还需要提供有关您申请的任何扣除额或抵免额的信息。有关提交纳税申报表可能需要的个人、工作和财务信息的更多详细信息，请访问 CRA 网站上的此页面。	To file your return, you will need to provide additional information about your income found on tax slips such as your T4 (Statement of Renumeration Paid), T3 (Statement of Trust Income Allocations and Designations), and T5 (Statement of Investment Income). You will also need to provide information about any deductions or credits you are claiming. For more details on the personal, work and financial information you may require to file your tax return, visit this page on the CRA website.
	
## **所得税减免收据**	**Receipts for income tax deductions**
	
您应保留所有与医疗费用[\[4\]](#_ftn4)、慈善捐款[\[5\]](#_ftn5)和业务费用[\[6\]](#_ftn6)有关的正式收据，以备不时之需在您提交申报表后六年，以防 CRA 稍后提出要求。您可能有资格申请各种扣除或抵免，包括：	You should keep all official receipts relating to medical expenses[\[4\]](#_ftn4), charitable donations[\[5\]](#_ftn5) and business expenses[\[6\]](#_ftn6) for six years after you file a return in case the CRA requests them later. You may be eligible to claim various deductions or credits including:
