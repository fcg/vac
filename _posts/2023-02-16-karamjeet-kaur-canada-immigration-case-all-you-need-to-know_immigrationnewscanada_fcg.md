Karamjeet Kaur 加拿大移民案：所有你需要知道的	Karamjeet Kaur Canada Immigration Case: All You Need To Know
	
2023 年 2 月 16 日，美国东部标准时间上午 9:13 Gagandeep Kaur Sekhon 加拿大移民，遣返令	16 February 2023, 9:13 AM EST Gagandeep Kaur Sekhon Canada Immigration , Removal Order
	
!Karamjeet Kaur 加拿大案例	!Karamjeet Kaur Canada Case
	
	  
	
近日，加拿大Karamjeet Kaur案因失实报道浮出水面。这名国际学生的案件于 2023 年 1 月 19 日作出决定，他最初于 2018 年 4 月持学习签证来到加拿大。	Recently, Karamjeet Kaur Canada case surfaced in the news for misrepresentation. A decision was made in the case of this international student on January 19, 2023, who originally came to Canada on study visa in April 2018.
	
这对 Karam 来说是一个不幸的决定，我们希望没有人会在不知不觉中成为欺诈顾问的受害者。	This is an unfortunate decision for Karam and we hope nobody unknowingly being victim of fraudulent consultant face this.
	
她现在收到了针对她的驱逐令。持有排除令离开加拿大的人在 5 年内不得再次进入加拿大。	She now has an exclusion order issued against her. A person who leaves Canada with an exclusion order is not allowed to re-enter Canada for 5 years.
	
可能有很多类似于 Karamjeet 持学习签证来到加拿大的案例，他们在不知不觉中发现他们的顾问或代理人提供的录取通知书是欺诈性的。	There could be many cases similar to Karamjeet’s who came to Canada on study visa unknowingly that their letter of acceptance provided by their consultant or agent was fraudulent.
	
在这篇文章中，我们将提出这个案例的细节，以便我们的读者对这种情况有所了解，避免犯这样的错误。	In this article, we will put forward the details of this case so that our readers stay aware of such a scenario and avoid making such mistakes.
	
Karamjeet Kaur 究竟发生了什么？	What exactly happened with Karamjeet Kaur?
	
来自印度旁遮普邦的Karamjeet Kaur（24岁）聘请了一个人来申请加拿大学习签证，她认为这是一名移民顾问。	Karamjeet Kaur (24-year-old) from Punjab, India hired a person to apply for Canada study visa, which she believed was an immigration consultant.
	
根据 Karam 的说法，她从未见过这位顾问，也没有为她的学习签证申请签署任何文件。	As per Karam, she never met this consultant nor did she sign any documents for her study visa application.
	
2018年1月，顾问通知她收到了Seneca College的录取通知书。	In January 2018, the consultant informed her that she received an acceptance letter from Seneca College.
	
申请人根据塞内卡学院的录取通知书，于 2018 年 4 月持学习签证前往加拿大。	The Applicant travelled to Canada in April 2018 on study visa based on her acceptance letter from Seneca College.
	
!Karamjeet Kaur 加拿大	!Karamjeet Kaur Canada
	
顾问在她抵达加拿大后不久通知申请人，由于顾问与学院之间存在分歧，她无法就读塞内卡学院。	The consultant informed the Applicant shortly after her arrival in Canada that there was a problem with her attending Seneca College due to a disagreement between the consultant and the college.
	
此后，申请人调查了加拿大的其他教育机会，并就读于埃德蒙顿的诺奎斯特学院，在那里她获得了两年的工商管理文凭。	Following this, the Applicant investigated alternative educational opportunities in Canada and enrolled at Norquest College in Edmonton, where she earned a two-year Business Administration diploma.
	
然后，她于 2022 年 7 月获得了毕业后工作许可 (PGWP)，并申请了永久居留权 (PR)。	Then, she got a Post-Graduation Work Permit (PGWP) in July 2022 and applied for permanent residency (PR).
	
她于 2021 年 5 月接受了加拿大边境服务局 (CBSA) 的面谈，并获悉，由于她在学生签证申请中的**虚假陈述**，IRPA 第 44 条报告已针对她提出。	She had an interview with the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) in May 2021 and was informed that an IRPA section 44 Report had been made against her as a consequence of a **misrepresentation** on her student visa application.
	
顾问的塞内卡学院录取通知书被证明是欺诈性的。当 CBSA 告知他们这一事实后，这家人在印度对顾问提起了刑事诉讼。	The consultant’s Seneca College acceptance letter turned out to be fraudulent. The family filed a criminal case against the consultant in India when the CBSA notified them of this truth.

加拿大移民局 (ID) 调查结果	Canada Immigration Division (ID) Findings
	
由于卡拉姆没有在签证申请表上签字，身份证质疑她是否间接错报。	Because Karam had not signed the visa application form, the ID questioned if she had made an indirect misstatement.
	
在听证会上，她承认她知道她的堂兄在她申请的一份文件上伪造了她的签名，即使用代表表格。	During the hearing, she confessed that she was aware that her cousin had forged her signature on one of the documents in her application, the Use of Representative form.
	
根据身份证，证据显示_“她知道正在提交学习许可申请，并且她允许她的堂兄和移民顾问提交学习许可申请。”_	The evidence, according to the ID, revealed that _“she was aware that an application for a Study Permit was being submitted and that she permitted her cousin and the immigration consultant to file the application for the Study Permit.”_
	
ID 表示，申请人有责任确保她的申请完整、正确且符合法律规定。	The ID said that it was the Applicant’s responsibility to ensure that her application was full, correct, and in accordance with the law.
	
因此，ID 确定申请人知道顾问和她的堂兄代表她提交申请，导致虚假陈述。	As a result, ID determined that the Applicant was aware that the consultant and her cousin were submitting an application on her behalf, resulting in a misrepresentation.
	
ID对无罪抗辩的考虑	ID’s Consideration Of Defence of Innocent Mistake
	
根据案例详情，ID 还解决了无意错误抗辩，并确定它不适用于本案。	As per the case details, the ID also addressed the innocent error defence and determined that it did not apply in this case.
	
ID 接受了申请人的真实信念，即她在无辜错误测试的第一部分（主观信念）中被 Seneca College 录取。	The ID accepted the Applicant’s genuine belief that she had been admitted to Seneca College on the first part of the innocent error test (subjective belief).
	
然而，在第二部分测试中，该信念在客观上是否合理，ID发现Karam的防御失败。	However, on the second part of test, whether the belief was objectively reasonable, the ID found the Karam’s defence failed.
	
根据ID，没有迹象表明申请人无法通过电话或电子邮件联系Seneca College以确认她的注册，无论是在她收到信件时还是在她到达加拿大时。	According to the ID, there was no indication that the Applicant was unable to contact Seneca College through phone or email to confirm her enrolment, either when she got the letter or when she arrived in Canada.
	
ID 发现证明她在 Seneca College 就读的能力由申请人拥有。	The ID discovered that the capacity to certify her presence at Seneca College was under the Applicant’s possession.

加拿大联邦法院的司法审查	Judicial Review In The Federal Court Of Canada
	
Karamjeet Kaur 在加拿大联邦法院对 ID 的决定提出质疑，并对 ID 的决定提出质疑。以下是卡拉姆辩护的摘要。	Karamjeet Kaur challenged ID’s decision in the Federal Court of Canada and raised issues with decision of ID. Below is the summary of Karam’s defence.
	
### 学生签证申请的有效期：	Validness of Student Visa Application:
	
卡拉姆说，她没有按照上述规定签署申请，因此申请无效。	Karam said she did not sign the application as required by the aforesaid Regulations, hence the application is null and void.
	
此外，她声称她未签名的签证申请不完整，根据 IRPR 第 12 节，它应该退还给她，而不是由 CBSA 保留。	Further, she claims that her unsigned visa application was incomplete and that, according to section 12 of IRPR, it should have been returned to her and not kept by CBSA.
	
她声称，由于 IRPR 第 10 和 12 节，系统中“没有”应用程序，因此不会因为应用程序不存在而发现虚假陈述。	She claims that because of sections 10 and 12 IRPR, there is “no” application in the system, and so no misrepresentation can be found because an application does not exist.
	
**根据联邦法院**，这种观点很难与申请人根据提交的申请获得学习签证这一事实相协调。申请人还利用学习许可申请了以后的 PGWP 和永久居留权。	**As per the Federal court** , this viewpoint is difficult to reconcile with the fact that the Applicant obtained a study visa based on the application filed. The Applicant also utilized the study permit to apply for her PGWP later and permanent residency.
	
因此，申请人声称她的申请从未发生过的说法既不合理也不可信，因为她已经获得了根据她的申请获得的学习签证的优势。	As a result, the Applicant’s argument that her application never occurred is neither reasonable nor plausible, given that she has reaped the advantages of the study visa obtained based on her application.
	
### 无辜的虚假陈述测试	Innocent Misrepresentation Test
	
**Karam 的辩护：** 当询问她是否认为自己被 Seneca College 录取时，她声称 ID 误用了考试。她声称，真正的问题是她是否有理由相信塞内卡学院的录取通知书是真实的。	**Karam’s Defence:** She claimed that the ID misapplied the exam when it asked if she thought she was admitted to Seneca College. The actual question, she claims, is whether it was reasonable for her to believe the letter of admission from Seneca College was authentic.
	
联邦法院引用了一个旧的案件判决书，“_申请人信任一名移民顾问，结果被骗了。然而，这些情况并不能免除申请人虚假陈述的后果。”_	The Federal court referenced an old case judgement stating, “ _The Applicant placed her trust in an immigration consultant and was deceived. However, these circumstances do not absolve the Applicant from the consequences of her misrepresentation.”_
	
此外，法院引用了一个_“申请人始终对其申请的内容负责，并且如果他们未能审查其申请并确保其完整性和准确性，则认为他或她没有歪曲重要事实是不合理的”_	Further, the Court cited an _“applicant is always responsible for the content of their application, and the belief that he or she was not misrepresenting a material fact is not reasonable where they fail to review their application and ensure its completeness and veracity”_
	
### 如果应用了无辜的虚假陈述例外？	If the innocent misrepresentation exception applied?
	
**Karam 的辩护：** 在审查无辜虚假陈述的豁免时，她辩护说 ID 忽略了她的特殊情况。她声称身份证忽略了一个事实，即她是一名来自印度农村的残疾和受迫害的年轻女性，父母没有受过教育。	**Karam’s defence:** When examining the exemption for innocent misrepresentation, she defends that the ID neglected to consider her particular circumstances. She claims that the ID overlooked the fact that she is a disabled and persecuted young woman from rural India with uneducated parents.
	
她声称，移民局过分强调了她来加拿大后的活动，但它应该评估印度一位残疾、受压迫的女士在那里时会做什么。	She claims that the ID overly emphasized her activities after coming in Canada, but that it should have evaluated what a disabled, oppressed lady in India would have done while there.
	
**联邦法院的调查结果：** 法院同意并相信 ID 充分考虑并解决了她提出的情况，如下 ID 所述：	**Federal Court finding:** The court agrees and believe the ID fully considered and grappled with the circumstances raised by her, as stated by ID below:
	
！	!
	
此外，虽然她将自己描述为处境不利且资源匮乏的人，但她在印度的中学后教育使她对这种看法产生了怀疑。尤其是考虑到她以前的计算机科学学位。	Furthermore, while she depicts herself as disadvantaged and lacking in resources, her post-secondary education in India brings this submission into doubt. This is especially given her previous degrees in computer science.
	
因此，加拿大联邦法院维持了移民部 (ID) 的决定并签发了排除令。	As a result, the Federal Court of Canada upheld the Immigration Division’s (ID) decision and issued the exclusion order.
	
Karam 现已提交人道主义和同情 (H&C) 考虑申请，我们希望她的 H&C 休假申请对她有利。	Karam has now filed an application for humanitarian and compassionate (H&C) consideration and we hope that her H&C leave application turns into her favour.
