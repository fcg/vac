更多的加拿大省份正在为与加拿大有家庭联系的候选人提供移民加拿大之旅的助力。	More Canadian provinces are giving candidates with family connections to Canada a boost on their journey to immigrate to Canada.
	
本月早些时候，艾伯塔省调整了其[省提名计划](	Earlier this month, Alberta tweaked its [Provincial Nominee Program]
	
今年，大约 25% 的艾伯塔省快速通道提名将提供给有父母、子女或兄弟姐妹居住在该省的技术工人。资格标准没有改变，只是有直系亲属的候选人将获得优先邀请。	This year, about 25% of Alberta Express Entry Stream nominations will go to skilled workers who also have a parent, child, or sibling living in the province. The eligibility criteria is not changing, just the fact that candidates with immediate family members will get priority invitations.
	
艾伯塔省是最新一个帮助候选人将家人带到加拿大或与已经在这里的人团聚的省份。许多其他加拿大移民计划已经优先考虑在该国有家人的候选人。	Alberta is just the latest province to help candidates bring families to Canada, or reunite with those who are already here. A number of other Canadian immigration programs already give priority to candidates just for having family in the country.
	
值得注意的是，加拿大的快速入境系统为在加拿大有兄弟姐妹的候选人提供了额外的加分。 2020 年，大约 10% 的被邀请申请永久居留权的快速通道候选人表示，他们有一个或多个兄弟姐妹永久居住在加拿大，这一比例与往年大致持平。	Notably, Canada’s Express Entry system offers candidates additional points for having a sibling in Canada. In 2020, around 10 percent of Express Entry candidates who are invited to apply for permanent residence indicated that they have a sibling, or siblings, living in Canada permanently, a share roughly in line with previous years.
	
与在美国不同，您不能只担保您的兄弟姐妹移民加拿大。在加拿大，您只能在非常特殊的情况下担保兄弟、姐妹、阿姨或叔叔等亲属。	Unlike in the U.S., you cannot just sponsor your siblings for Canadian immigration. In Canada, you can only sponsor relatives like a brother, sister, aunt or uncle in very specific circumstances.
	
但是，当您申请加拿大移民时，您可以在申请中包括您的配偶和子女。	However, when you are applying for Canadian immigration, you can include your spouse and children on your application.
	
加拿大政府有责任支持移民的家庭团聚。家庭可以以不太可量化的方式帮助移民申请人。他们可能会照顾孩子，在家族企业中担任无偿劳动，或提供情感支持。	The Canadian government has a mandate to support the family reunification of immigrants. Families can help immigration applicants in less quantifiable ways. They may look after children, work as unpaid labour in a family business, or provide emotional support.
	
### 加拿大家庭移民项目	Canadian immigration programs for families
	
如果您是永久居民/公民，并且您希望担保您的外国配偶、普通法同居伴侣或婚姻伴侣，您可以通过配偶担保来实现。您还可以通过父母和祖父母计划 (PGP) 为您的孩子以及您的父母和父母提供加拿大移民担保。	If you are a permanent resident/citizen and you wish to sponsor your foreign spouse, common-law or conjugal partner, you may do so through Spousal Sponsorship. You may also sponsor your children for Canadian immigration, as well as your parents and parents through the Parents and Grandparents Program (PGP).
	
其他多个省份已经有 PNP，有利于有家人居住在加拿大的候选人。	Multiple other provinces already have PNPs that favour candidates who have family living in Canada.
	
安大略省的人力资本流要求申请人证明他们打算在获得永久居留权后实际居住在该省。申请人可以利用家庭关系和个人关系来满足这一要求。	Ontario’s Human Capital Stream requires applicants to prove that they intend to actually live in the province after they get permanent residence. Applicants can use family ties and personal relationships to meet this requirement.
	
曼尼托巴省早就知道优先考虑有家庭关系的候选人的好处。您可以根据曼尼托巴省的意向书 (EOI) 系统获得积分，因为您有家人甚至密友住在该省。	Manitoba has long known the benefits of prioritizing candidates with family connections. You can get points under Manitoba’s Expression of Interest (EOI) system for having family or even a close friend living in the province.
	
职业需求和萨斯喀彻温省快速通道子类别的萨斯喀彻温省候选人也可以获得家庭加分。如果您或您的配偶有亲戚住在萨斯喀彻温省，您的总分可以获得 20 分。这种加分可能会对获得萨斯喀彻温省的邀请产生重大影响。符合条件的家庭成员包括您的：父母、兄弟姐妹、祖父母、阿姨、叔叔、侄女、侄子、表亲和继亲家庭成员或具有相同关系的姻亲。	Saskatchewan-bound candidates of the Occupation In-Demand and Saskatchewan Express Entry subcategories can also get extra points for family. If you or your spouse have a relative living in Saskatchewan, you could get 20 points toward your overall score. This points boost could make all the difference in securing an invitation from Saskatchewan. Eligible family members include your: parent, sibling, grandparent, aunt, uncle, niece, nephew, first cousin and step-family members or in-laws of the same relationships.
	
魁北克还为家庭提供额外加分。如果您有儿子、女儿、父亲、母亲、兄弟、姐妹、祖父或祖母作为永久居民或公民居住在魁北克，您可以获得额外三分。魁北克还为带孩子来拉贝勒省的候选人提供最多 8 分的额外加分。	Quebec also gives extra points for families. You can get three extra points for having a son, daughter, father, mother, brother, sister, grandfather, or grandmother living in Quebec as a permanent resident or citizen. Quebec also awards up to eight additional points to candidates bringing children with them to la belle province.
	
虽然并非每个省份都明确优先考虑那些有家人已经居住在加拿大的人，但如果未来有更多的加拿大移民计划在此基础上进行调整，也就不足为奇了	While not every province gives explicitly priority to those with family already living in Canada, it would be no surprise if more Canadian immigration programs are tweaked in the future on this basis
