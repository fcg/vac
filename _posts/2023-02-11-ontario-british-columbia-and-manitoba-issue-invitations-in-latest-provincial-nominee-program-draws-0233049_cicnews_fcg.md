安大略省、不列颠哥伦比亚省和曼尼托巴省在最新的省提名计划抽签中发出邀请 三个省份本周已向候选人发出邀请。	Ontario, British Columbia, and Manitoba issue invitations in latest Provincial Nominee Program draws Three provinces have issued invitations to candidates this week.
	
本周，安大略省、不列颠哥伦比亚省和曼尼托巴省已发出邀请，通过省提名计划 (PNP) 向候选人提出申请。	Ontario, British Columbia, and Manitoba have issued invitations to apply to candidates through Provincial Nominee Programs (PNPs) this week.
	
大多数加拿大省和地区（魁北克和努纳武特除外）都有自己的 PNP。通过这些项目，有兴趣的候选人可能会被邀请申请省提名。获得省提名有利于获得永久居留权。	Most Canadian provinces and territories (except for Quebec and Nunavut) operate their own PNPs. Through these programs, interested candidates may be invited to apply for provincial nomination. Receiving a provincial nomination can be advantageous for gaining permanent residence.
	
魁北克的移民计划由该省管理，与加拿大的移民计划不同。魁北克省是唯一一个控制所有经济类移民的省份。	Quebec’s immigration programs are administered by the province and are distinct from Canada’s immigration programs. Quebec is the only province that has control over all economic class immigrants.
	
省提名计划 (PNP) 每年有 105,000 名永久居民。它始于 1998 年，此后每年 PNP 录取人数稳步增长。联邦和省政府都认为这是促进城市中心以外地区经济发展的有效工具。	The Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) accounts for 105,000 PR admissions per year. It began in 1998 and the annual number of PNP admissions has since increased steadily. Both federal and provincial governments consider it an effective tool to promote economic development outside of urban centers.
