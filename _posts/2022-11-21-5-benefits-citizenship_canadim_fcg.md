作为加拿大永久居民，您可以享受许多与拥有公民身份的人相同的资源。您可以就读公立学校和医疗保健，可以在加拿大任何地方生活和工作，并且您的公民自由受到加拿大法律和加拿大权利与自由宪章的保护。那么，将您的永久居留身份换成加拿大公民有什么好处呢？	As a Canadian permanent resident, you benefit from many of the same resources as those with citizenship status. You have access to publicly funded schools and healthcare, can live and work anywhere in Canada, and your civil liberties are protected under Canadian law and by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. So, what are the benefits of trading in your permanent residence status for Canadian citizenship?
		
1\。你可以投票	1\. You can vote
	
加拿大以议会民主制运作。在每次联邦选举中，每位 18 岁以上的加拿大公民都可以投票选举我们的总理。但除了联邦选举，还有定期的省市选举，公民可以投票。	Canada operates as a parliamentary democracy. At every federal election, every Canadian citizen over the age of 18 can cast a ballot to vote for our Prime Minister. But in addition to federal elections, there are also regular provincial and municipal elections that citizens can vote in.
	
投票让您对谁管理您的国家、省、地区和城镇有发言权。这是加拿大公民的主要利益和责任。	Voting gives you a say in who runs your country, province, territory, and town. This a major benefit and responsibility of Canadian citizenship.
	
2\.你可以竞选公职	2\. You can run for office
	
作为加拿大公民，您也可以竞选公职。如果您有兴趣，可以参加市、省或联邦选举。	As a Canadian citizen, you can also run for office. If you’re interested you can run in municipal, provincial, or federal elections.
	
加拿大有几个主要政党。如果你有兴趣参与政治，你可以加入一个青年组织，或者以独立候选人的身份参选。	There are several major political parties in Canada. If you’re interested in getting involved in politics, you can join a youth wing, or run as an independent candidate.
	
3\.你可以自由旅行	3\. You can travel freely
	
作为加拿大公民，您可以申请获得加拿大护照。与枫叶卡不同，护照只需每 5-10 年更新一次。	As a Canadian citizen, you can apply to get a Canadian passport. Unlike PR cards, passports only need to be renewed every 5-10 years.
	
加拿大护照在世界上名列前茅。持有加拿大护照，您无需签证即可前往世界上许多国家。与您的永久居留旅行证件相比，您的加拿大护照还可以让您更轻松地重新进入该国。	The Canadian passport is ranked among the best in the world. With a Canadian passport, you can travel to a number of countries around the world without needing a visa. Your Canadian passport will also allow you to re-enter the country more easily than your permanent residence travel documents would.
	
4\。你的孩子将成为加拿大人	4\. Your kids will be Canadians
	
如果您是加拿大公民并且您有孩子，_无论该孩子是否在加拿大出生_，他们自动成为加拿大公民。这意味着他们可以从您的身份中受益，而无需经历申请加拿大公民身份的相同过程。	If you are a Canadian citizen and you have a child, _whether that child is born in Canada or not_, they are automatically a Canadian citizen. This means they can benefit from your status without going through the same process of applying for Canadian citizenship.
	
如果您是永久居民，您的孩子将成为加拿大公民_只有当孩子在加拿大出生_。如果您的孩子在国外出生，您将不得不资助他或她。	If you are a permanent resident, your child will be a Canadian citizen _only if that child is born in Canada_. If your child is born abroad, you will have to sponsor him or her.
	
5\。你可以住在任何地方	5\. You can live anywhere
	
作为加拿大公民，您可以在世界任何地方自由居住，想住多久就住多久，并且不会失去公民身份。与永久居留权不同，加拿大公民没有居住要求。唯一的限制是在国外居住超过五年的加拿大人将失去在联邦选举中的投票权。	As a Canadian citizen, you are free to live anywhere in the world you like for as long as you like, and you will not lose your citizenship. Unlike permanent residency, there are no residency requirements for Canadian citizens. The only restriction is that Canadians living abroad for a period of more than five years lose the right to vote in federal elections.
	
**你知道吗：**自 1977 年以来，加拿大政府承认多重公民身份。这意味着当您成为加拿大公民时，您不必放弃以前的公民身份。	**Did you know:** Since 1977, the Canadian government has recognized multiple citizenship. That means that you don’t have to give up your previous citizenship when you become a Canadian citizen.
