长期以来，加拿大一直是向来自其他国家的人提供避难所和融入社会机会的国家的典范。难民私人赞助 (PSR) 计划已经存在了 40 多年，加拿大人和永久居民团结一致，通过每年重新安置数千人来提供安全和稳定。	Canada has long been an example of a country that offers refuge and the opportunity for integration to those from other countries. The Private Sponsorship of Refugees (PSR) Program has existed for over 40 years now, with Canadians and permanent residents united in their pursuit to provide safety and stability through resettlement to thousands every year.
	
PSR 计划是加拿大人第一次有机会参与难民安置，并于 1978 年正式开始。1979 年至 2020 年间，超过 350,000 名难民根据该计划进入加拿大。	The PSR Program was the first opportunity for Canadians to participate in the resettlement of refugees, and it began in earnest in 1978. More than 350,000 refugees entered Canada under the program between 1979 and 2020.
	
如果没有这个由 130 多个赞助协议持有人 (SAH) 倡导的集体努力，加拿大就不会在欢迎如此多的难民进入我们国家方面取得如此成功。	Without this group effort championed by more than 130 sponsorship agreement holders (SAHs), Canada would not have achieved such success in welcoming so many into our nation as refugees.

移民部长肖恩·弗雷泽 (Sean Fraser) 于 2023 年 2 月 17 日在渥太华宣布，为表彰为支持难民而发展起来的众多社区组织，难民赞助人数显着增加——从 2012 年引入时的 1,300 人增加到 2023 年的 13,500 人。	In recognition of the numerous community organizations that have grown to support refugees, Minister of Immigration, Sean Fraser announced on February 17, 2023, in Ottawa, an impressive increase in refugee sponsorship-from 1,300 when introduced in 2012 to a whopping 13,500 by 2023.
	
> 这是 12,150 个 SAH 机会的扩展！随着我们继续推进该计划的发展，这些数字肯定会为世界各地的人们带来有意义的变化和急需的帮助。	> This is an expansion of 12,150 more opportunities for SAHs! As we continue forward with this program's growth, these numbers are sure to bring about meaningful change and much-needed assistance for people all around the world.
	
额外的薪资空间将对新的和已建立的赞助协议持有人都大有裨益，因为它们有助于开展业务并促进组织内部的发展。这些组织提供的支持是无价的；从寻找难民到提交申请，它涵盖了流程的所有阶段。此外，一旦受资助的新移民抵达加拿大，SAH 会为他们提供长期援助，以确保他们成功过渡到社会。	The extra cap spaces will be greatly beneficial to both new and established sponsorship agreement holders, as they help launch their operations and allows for growth within the organizations. The support provided by these organizations is invaluable; from searching out refugees to submitting applications, it covers all stages of the process. Moreover, once sponsored newcomers arrive in Canada, SAHs provide them with long-term assistance to ensure a successful transition into society.
	
> “我们的政府正在将赞助协议持有人可以赞助的难民人数增加到 13,500 人，比 2012 年首次引入上限时增加了 10 倍。今天的公告将支持这些社区组织的重要工作，以便他们能够继续帮助来自世界各地的难民在加拿大定居。我要感谢这些合作伙伴，他们年复一年地使这个项目成为可能。你的工作证明了加拿大人的同情心，我们感谢你所做的一切。”	> “Our government is increasing the number of refugees that can be sponsored by sponsorship agreement holders to 13,500, a 10-fold increase from when the cap was first introduced in 2012. Today’s announcement will support the vital work of these community organizations so they can continue helping refugees from around the world settle in Canada. I want to thank these partners, who make this program possible year after year. Your work is a testament to the compassion of Canadians, and we’re grateful for all that you do.”

SAH 与 IRCC 签订合同，承诺每年赞助一定数量的难民在加拿大重新安置。在通常为 12 个月的赞助期间，赞助商会为难民家庭提供经济支持和搬迁协助。经济援助涵盖每月经常性的基本开支（包括住房、食品、公共交通、衣服和家具）以及社会和情感支持。	SAHs enter into contracts with IRCC committing to sponsor a specific number of refugees each year for resettlement in Canada. Throughout the duration of the sponsorship, which is normally 12 months, sponsors give refugee families financial support and assistance with relocation. Financial assistance covers recurring monthly expenses for basics (including housing, food, transit in public, clothes, and furnishings) as well as social and emotional support.
	
让它发生的程序	The Programs That Make It Happen
	
政府援助难民计划 (GAR) 和混合签证办公室转介 (BVOR) 计划是加拿大的另外两项重新安置计划，并通过 PSR 计划得到加强。它们共同使加拿大每年能够接收比其自身更多的难民，它们只是该国努力实现到 2025 年引进超过 83,500 名私人赞助难民的目标的众多方式之一。	The Government-Assisted Refugee Program (GAR) as well as the Blended Visa Office-Referred (BVOR) Program, are Canada's other two resettlement initiatives, and are enhanced by the PSR Program. Together, they enable Canada to accept more refugees each year than it could by itself, and they are only one of the numerous ways the country is striving to meet its target of bringing in more than 83,500 privately sponsored refugees by 2025.
	
加拿大的移民和难民目标	Canada’s Immigration & Refugee Goals
	
根据 IRCC 的 2023-2025 年移民水平战略，加拿大将继续在难民的融合和重新安置方面处于世界领先地位，在接下来的三年中将接待超过 144,000 名难民，其中包括超过 83,500 名私人赞助的难民。	In accordance with the IRCC's 2023–2025 Immigration Levels Strategy, Canada will continue to be a leader in the world for the integration and resettlement of refugees, hosting over 144,000 of them in the following three years, including over 83,500 who are sponsored privately.
	
> “除了他们自己的运营成本和服务交付成本之外，赞助协议持有人及其社区合作伙伴每年还贡献大约 1.35 亿美元的赞助资金。赞助社区对 2023 年赞助空间的增加感到高兴，并赞扬 IRCC 为解决大量处理积压问题所做的重要工作。我们希望在 2023 年看到所有 PSR 计划重新安置的新移民都有大量登陆。” – Lena Awwad，SAH 委员会副主席，伊斯兰家庭和社会服务协会研究和项目主任	> “Sponsorship agreement holders and their community partners contribute roughly $135 million annually in sponsorship funds, in addition to their own operating costs and service delivery costs. The sponsorship community is pleased with the increase in sponsorship spaces for 2023 and commends the important work IRCC is undertaking to address the significant processing backlogs. We hope to see high numbers of landings in 2023 for all PSR Program resettled newcomers.” – Lena Awwad, SAH Council Vice Chair, and Research and Programs Director at Islamic Family and Social Services Association
