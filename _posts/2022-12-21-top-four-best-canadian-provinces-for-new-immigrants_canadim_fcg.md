根据您的个人资料以及您在流程中所处的位置，一个重要的考虑因素可能是哪个省有适合您的提名计划。	Depending on your profile, and where you are at in the process, one important consideration may be which province has a nominee program that is right for you.
	
其他注意事项可能取决于您的生活方式、工作领域和天气偏好。为了帮助您入门，以下是加拿大最受欢迎的四个移民省份：	Other considerations might depend on your lifestyle, field of work, and weather preferences. To help you get started, here are four of the most popular Canadian provinces for immigrants:
	
1. 安大略省	1.    Ontario
	
安大略省是迄今为止最受新移民来加拿大欢迎的省份。 2021 年，安大略省接收了大约一半的新加拿大永久居民。	Ontario is by far the most popular province for new immigrants coming to Canada. In 2021, Ontario received about half of all new Canadian permanent residents.
	
安大略省最受欢迎的城市也是加拿大最大的城市。在将安大略省作为目的地省份的新移民中，大多数人打算在多伦多市定居。多伦多是世界上最具国际化和多元文化的城市之一，一半以上的居民属于可见的少数群体。	Ontario’s most popular city is also the largest in Canada. Among the newcomers that indicated Ontario as their province of destination, a majority intended to settle in the city of Toronto. Toronto is one of the most metropolitan and multicultural cities in the world, with more than half of residents belonging to a visible minority group.
	
渥太华是安大略省第二大热门城市，也是加拿大的首都。渥太华被认为是加拿大最安全的城市之一。加拿大的首都城市还提供高品质的生活和低廉的生活成本。	Ottawa is the second most popular city in Ontario and is also the capital of Canada. Ottawa is considered one of the safest cities in Canada. Canada’s capital city also offers a high quality of life and low living costs.
	
毫无疑问，安大略省的冬天会变冷。在安大略省的某些地区，冬季月份的气温可能低于 -40°C。一旦夏季到来，这一切都是值得的，炎热的月份温度高达 30°C 以上。	There’s no doubt that the winters in Ontario can get cold. In some parts of Ontario, the winter months can see temperatures below -40°C. It’s all worth it once the summertime comes around, with hot months getting up to above 30°C.
	
安大略省拥有强大的经济，主要通过资源、制造专业知识和出口的结合，创造了全国 GDP 的 37%。该省还拥有近 50% 的高科技、金融服务和其他知识密集型行业的员工。	Ontario boasts a strong economy, generating 37% of the national GDP, mainly through a combination of resources, manufacturing expertise, and exports. The province is also the home to nearly 50% of all employees in high-tech, financial services, and other knowledge-intensive industries.
	
2\.不列颠哥伦比亚省	2\. British Columbia
	
不列颠哥伦比亚省位于加拿大西海岸，以其美丽的自然景观而闻名。继安大略省之后，不列颠哥伦比亚省是 2021 年最受欢迎的新移民目的地省份。不列颠哥伦比亚省通常被认为是加拿大最适合寻求户外探险和温和气温的移民的省份。	Located on the west coast of Canada, British Columbia is known for its beautiful natural landscape. After Ontario, British Columbia was the most popular province of destination for new immigrants in 2021. British Columbia is often considered the best province in Canada for immigrants looking for outdoor adventures and milder temperatures.

对于那些喜欢温和的冬天的人来说，不列颠哥伦比亚省是一个很好的省份。 British Columba 的沿海地区拥有全加拿大最温和的冬季，很少低于冰点温度。与不列颠哥伦比亚省的海岸相比，内陆和中部地区的冬季往往更冷、下雪更多，但夏季也更热。	British Columbia is a great province for those who prefer their winter on the moderate side. The coastal regions of British Columba have some of the mildest winters in all of Canada, rarely dropping below freezing temperatures. The interior and central regions tend to have colder and snowier winters, but also have hotter summers than the coast of B.C.
