Express Entry：IRCC 如何决定何时举行抽奖？ 《移民与难民与保护法》中没有规定必须多久进行一次快速通道抽签。	Express Entry: How does IRCC decide when to hold draws? There is no rule in the Immigration and Refugees and Protection Act that dictates how frequently Express Entry draws must occur.
	
最近围绕快速通道抽签的例程发生了变化。通常，抽奖每两周在周三举行。然而，加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 最近从 11 月 23 日开始暂停抽签六周，并于 1 月 11 日返回，邀请 5,500 名候选人，一周后又进行了一次同样规模的抽签。	There has been a change in routine surrounding Express Entry draws of late. Typically, the draws take place every two weeks on Wednesdays. However, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) recently paused draws for six weeks starting November 23 and returned on January 11 inviting 5,500 candidates followed by another draw of the same size a week later.
	
对于例程的改变没有确定的解释。在给 CIC News 的电子邮件中，IRCC 发言人暗示暂停是由于实施 NOC 2021 引起的系统故障，他说：“2022 年 11 月 16 日实施新分类系统的技术问题产生了不利影响2022 年 11 月 23 日的快速通道邀请轮次。这些技术问题虽然给 IRCC 客户带来了极大的不便，但已得到解决。 2023 年 1 月 11 日成功实施了一轮 Express Entry 邀请。”	There is no confirmed explanation for the change in routine. In an email to CIC News, an IRCC spokesperson implied that the pause was due to a system glitch caused by the implementation of NOC 2021, saying, “Technical issues with the implementation of the new classification system on November 16, 2022, had adverse implications for the November 23, 2022, Express Entry invitation round. These technical issues, while a great inconvenience to IRCC clients, have since been resolved. A round of invitations for Express Entry was successfully implemented on January 11, 2023.”
	
该部门表示，IRCC 正在恢复更定期的快速通道申请邀请 (ITA) 轮次。然而，意外的停顿和紧接着的抽签对于 IRCC 来说太不正常了，以至于有人猜测 IRCC 如何决定抽签的频率和候选人的数量。	The department says IRCC is resuming more regularly scheduled Express Entry invitation to apply (ITA) rounds. However, the unexpected pause and following draws in quick succession are so out of character for IRCC that there has been speculation on how IRCC decides on the frequency of draws and the number of candidates.
	
快速入境申请管理系统下的移民途径针对来自三个项目的候选人；联邦技术工人计划 (FSWP)、加拿大经验类计划 (CEC) 和联邦技术贸易计划 (FSTP)。这些项目的候选人被认为是高技能经济移民。	Immigration pathways under the Express Entry application management system target candidates from three programs; the Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP), the Canadian Experience Class (CEC) and the Federal Skilled Trades Program (FSTP). Candidates in these programs are considered highly skilled economic immigrants.
	
符合条件的候选人将他们的个人资料上传到 IRCC 网站，并根据综合排名系统 (CRS) 获得分数。 CRS 分数最高的人最有可能收到申请永久居留权的邀请。	Eligible candidates upload their profiles to the IRCC website and receive a score under the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS). Those with the highest CRS scores are the most likely to receive an invitation to apply for permanent residency.
	
### 快速通道趋势	Express Entry trends
	
Express Entry 始于 2015 年，通常每年会进行 23 到 30 次抽签。 IRCC 创建它的目的是针对具有需求技能的潜在永久居民，他们可以迅速融入劳动力市场并增强加拿大的劳动力。	Express Entry started in 2015 and has typically seen between 23 and 30 draws each year. IRCC created it with the objective of targeting potential permanent residents with in-demand skills who could quickly integrate into the labour market and bolster Canada’s workforce.
	
大多数抽签都是全项目抽签，从 2019 年开始，每年都会专门针对 FSTP 进行一到两次抽签。在 2015 年和 2016 年，全项目抽签通常邀请不到 2,000 名候选人。这种情况在 2017-2019 年发生了变化，抽签超过 3,000 名候选人是很常见的。这样做的原因是 IRCC 正在从其现有的基于纸质的 FSWP、CEC 和 FSTP 应用程序过渡到最终通过 Express Entry 以电子方式管理所有应用程序。作为这一过程的一部分，IRCC 通过逐渐增加 ITA 来补充其现有的纸质申请清单，直到它在 2017 年初过渡。	Most draws have been all program draws, with one or two draws exclusively for the FSTP taking place each year into 2019. In 2015 and 2016, all-program draws typically saw fewer than 2,000 candidates invited. This changed in 2017-2019 and it was common to have draws of over 3,000 candidates. The reason for this is IRCC was transitioning from its existing paper-based FSWP, CEC, and FSTP applications towards eventually managing all of the applications electronically through Express Entry. As part of this process, IRCC complemented its existing inventory of paper-based applications by gradually increasing ITAs until it made the transition towards the start of 2017.
	
2020 年，COVID-19 大流行严重破坏了加拿大的移民系统，因为旅行限制、边境关闭和员工无法在办公室工作导致申请积压。作为回应，IRCC 于 2020 年 12 月停止了联邦技术工人计划 (FSWP) 和 FSTP 的抽签。加拿大经验类 (CEC) 的抽签仍在继续，直到 2021 年 9 月也暂停。IRCC 继续邀请来自省的快速入境候选人提名程序。	In 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic caused serious disruptions to Canada’s immigration system as travel restrictions, border closures and the inability of employees to work in their offices caused a backlog of applications. In response, IRCC stopped holding draws for the Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP) and FSTP in December 2020. Draws continued for the Canadian Experience Class (CEC) until those were paused too in September 2021. IRCC continued to invite Express Entry candidates from Provincial Nominee Programs.
	
即使抽签在程序方面变得有限，但仍在运行的抽签有规律地发生。	Even as draws became limited in terms of program, those that were still running occurred with regularity.
	
去年 7 月，所有项目的快速通道抽签恢复，抽签规模每两周增加一次，同时 CRS 分数下降，以便更多候选人获得 ITA。到 11 月 23 日，抽签规模高达 4,570，是自 2020 年 12 月以来最大的快速通道抽签。	In July last year, Express Entry draws resumed for all programs and draw size increased every two weeks, while CRS scores dropped to allow a higher number of candidates to receive ITAs. By November 23, draw sizes were up to 4,570, the largest Express Entry draw since December 2020.
	
### 管理快速通道的规则	Rules that govern Express Entry
	
**频率**	**Frequency**
	
正如《移民和难民保护法》(IRPA) 所规定的那样，没有固定的法律规定需要多久进行一次快速通道抽签。快速通道抽签的频率完全由移民部长和 IRCC 自行决定。受邀候选人的数量以及最低 CRS 分数由移民部长通过部长指示决定。	As it stands in the Immigration and Refugees Protection Act (IRPA), no set law that dictates how often Express Entry draws need to take place. The frequency of Express Entry draws is entirely up to the discretion of the immigration minister and IRCC. The number of candidates invited, as well as the minimum cut-off CRS score is decided by the immigration minister through ministerial instructions.
	
部长有权根据加拿大的经济优先事项邀请候选人，以增加劳动力。他们的工作之一是：	The minister has a mandate to invite candidates based on Canada’s economic priorities to bolster the labour force. It is part of their job to:
	
* 解决长期劳动力市场短缺和未来定位问题；和	  address chronic labour market shortages and positioning for the future; and
* 支持法语少数民族社区的法语移民和经济增长。	  support Francophone immigration and economic growth in Francophone minority communities.
	
部长可以灵活地发布政府认为会对加拿大劳动力产生积极影响的部长指示，同时也允许受邀候选人轻松融入。	The minister has the flexibility to issue ministerial instructions that the government believes will result in a positive impact on Canada’s workforce while also allowing the invited candidates to easily integrate.
	
**ITA数量**	**Number of ITAs**
	
与所有移民途径一样，快速通道在移民水平计划中概述了年度目标。列为联邦高技能工人的 2022 年目标是 55,900 人。 2023 年的目标急剧上升至 82,880，这意味着 IRCC 明年将需要邀请更多候选人来实现其目标。到 2024 年，IRCC 计划邀请 109,020 名联邦高技能候选人时，这一数字会更高。	Like all immigration pathways, Express Entry has a yearly target outlined in the Immigration Levels Plan. The target in 2022, listed as Federal High Skilled Workers, was 55,900. The target for 2023 shows a sharp rise at 82,880, meaning over the next year IRCC will need to invite more candidates to meet its goal. This goes even higher for 2024 when IRCC plans to invite 109,020 Federal High Skilled candidates.
	
部长和 IRCC 需要检查这些目标并计划邀请的候选人数量，这也意味着决定 CRS 分数高，但不一定高到限制候选人的数量。	The minister and IRCC need to examine these targets and plan for the number of candidates to invite, which also means deciding on CRS scores that are high, but not necessarily so high that it limits the number of candidates.
	
简而言之，IRPA 中没有任何法律规定快速通道抽签的任何方面，这完全由政府和移民部长自行决定。	In short, there are no laws in IRPA that dictate any aspect of how Express Entry draws are conducted and it is entirely at the discretion of the government and immigration minister.
	
### Express Entry 即将发生的变化	Changes to come for Express Entry
	
IRCC 表示，从今年春天开始，可能会通过针对职业、工作经验、教育或语言能力等属性的类别邀请候选人。	IRCC says starting this spring, candidates may be invited through categories that target attributes such as occupation, work experience, education, or language ability.
	
自去年 6 月 C-19 法案获得皇家批准以来，IRCC 一直致力于为 Express Entry 项目的候选人创建新的抽签类别。这与目前仅根据高 CRS 分数邀请候选人的方法大相径庭。移民部长表示，这将使加拿大能够专注于经济优先事项以及劳动力和技能短缺最严重的部门。	Since Bill C-19 received royal assent last June, IRCC has been working to create new draw categories for candidates in Express Entry programs. This is a major departure from the current method of inviting candidates based solely on a high CRS score. The immigration minister has said this will allow Canada to focus on economic priorities and sectors where labour and skills shortages are the most acute.
	
候选人仍然需要符合快速入境计划的资格，并在 IRCC 的网站上上传个人资料才能获得 CRS 分数。即使在有针对性的抽签中，CRS 分数较高的候选人也更有可能获得 ITA。	Candidates will still need to be eligible for an Express Entry program and upload a profile on IRCC’s website to receive a CRS score. Even in targeted draws, candidates with higher CRS scores will be more likely to receive an ITA.
	
有针对性的抽签会对抽签时间表产生什么影响（如果有的话）还有待观察。面对不断上升的移民目标，IRCC 很可能会继续定期抽签。	It remains to be seen what impact, if any, targeted draws will have on draw schedules. In the face of rising immigration targets, it is most likely that IRCC will continue to hold regular draws.
