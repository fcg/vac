## 移民部长肖恩·弗雷泽 (Sean Fraser) 宣布，其文件将于 2023 年到期的毕业后工作许可证 (PGWP) 持有人将能够将其工作许可证延长最多 18 个月。	Immigration Minister Sean Fraser has announced that Post Graduation Work Permit (PGWP) holders whose documents expire in 2023 will be able to extend their work permits for up to 18 months.
	
_与我们一起观看公告。_	_Watch the announcement with us._  
	
文件在 2023 年到期或即将到期的 PGWP 有资格获得最多 18 个月的额外或延长工作许可。	PGWPs whose documents expired or are expiring in year 2023 qualify for an additional or extended work permit of up to 18 months.
	
2023 年到期的 PGWP 持有人 Yogesh Tulani 说：“这是一项很好的临时措施，可以帮助那些因抽签暂停而受到影响的国际工人，”更有价值的加拿大工作经验，并将他们从利用这种情况的掠夺性移民从业者中拯救出来。”	“This is a great temporary measure to help international workers who were affected by the pauses in the draws,” says Yogesh Tulani, a PGWP holder with a 2023 expiry date, “This will allow the workers to continue to work while they work towards gaining more valuable Canadian work experience, and save them from predatory immigration practitioners who were capitalizing on the situation.”
	
从 2023 年 4 月 6 日开始，该措施将允许希望留在加拿大的 PGWP 持有人选择加入便利程序来延长他们的工作许可。	Starting April 6, 2023, the measure will allow PGWP holders who wish to stay in Canada to opt in to a facilitative process to extend their work permit.
	
文件已于 2023 年到期的 PGWP 持有人以及有资格获得 2022 年 PGWP 便利措施的人也将能够申请额外的 18 个月工作许可。那些工作许可证过期的人将能够恢复他们的身份，即使他们已经超过 90 天的恢复期，并且在等待新工作许可证申请的处理期间将获得临时工作许可。	PGWP holders whose documents have already expired in 2023 and those who were eligible for the 2022 PGWP facilitative measure will also be able to apply for an additional 18-month work permit. Those with expired work permits will be able to restore their status, even if they are beyond the 90-day restoration period, and will receive an interim work authorization while awaiting processing of their new work permit application.
	
加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 表示，符合新措施资格的 PGWP 持有人将很快收到有关登录其在线 IRCC 安全账户以选择加入和更新其关键个人信息的消息。	Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) says PGWP holders who are eligible for the new measure will soon receive messages about logging into their online IRCC Secure Account to opt in and update their key personal information.
	
根据 IRCC 的数据，约有 127,000 个 PGWP 将在 2023 年到期，尽管约有 67,000 个 PGWP 持有人已经申请永久居留，并且不需要通过此措施延长他们的工作许可。	According to IRCC’s figures, about 127,000 PGWPs are expiring in 2023, though about 67,000 PGWP holders have already applied for permanent residence and won’t need to extend their work permit through this measure.
	
###好久不见	A long time coming
	
在过去的几个月里，文件将于 2023 年到期的 PGWP 持有人一直在向政府施压，要求政府采取一项措施，让他们能够保持自己的身份。	Over the past few months, PGWP holders with documents expiring in 2023 have been pressuring the government for a measure that would allow them to keep their status.
	
通常情况下，PGWP 没有资格获得延期，但由于 Express Entry 抽签暂停，Fraser 之前对 2021 年 9 月至 2022 年 12 月 31 日到期的文件进行了例外处理。	Normally, PGWPs are not eligible for an extension, but due to a pause in Express Entry draws Fraser previously made an exception for documents expiring from September 2021 to December 31, 2022.
	
现在快速通道已经恢复，被邀请申请永久居留的最低分数线飙升。在之前的 Express Entry 抽签中，候选人至少需要 490 分才能获得永久居留的机会，这对于 30 岁以下的学士学位、良好的语言能力和至少一年的人来说也很难获得。的工作经验。	Now that Express Entry has resumed, the minimum cutoff score to be invited to apply for permanent residence has sky-rocketed. In the previous Express Entry draw, candidates needed at least 490 points in order to get the chance to apply for permanent residence, which is hard to get even for someone under age 30 with a bachelors’ degree, good language proficiency and at least a year of work experience.
	
为这组 PGWP 采取便利措施的想法得到了曼尼托巴省移民部长乔恩雷耶斯的支持，他本周早些时候在推特上发布了一封致弗雷泽的公开信。	The idea for a facilitative measure for this group of PGWPs was supported by Manitoba’s immigration minister, Jon Reyes, who tweeted an open letter to Fraser earlier this week.
