# 魁北克发布 2023 年符合简化 LMIA 资格的工作清单 魁北克于 2023 年 2 月 24 日发布了更新后的职业清单。	Quebec releases 2023 list of jobs eligible for simplified LMIAs Quebec released its updated occupations list on February 24, 2023.
魁北克移民部最近发布了符合简化劳动力市场影响评估 (LMIA) 处理条件的最新职业清单。	The Quebec Ministry of Immigration recently released its latest list of occupations eligible for simplified Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) processing.
	
简而言之，某些打算雇用临时外国工人开展业务的雇主必须获得 LMIA。这些文件旨在评估临时外国工人的雇用情况，并验证雇用是否会对加拿大的劳动力市场产生中立或积极的影响。	Briefly, LMIAs must be obtained by certain employers who intend to hire temporary foreign workers for their business. These documents are designed to provide assess the hiring of a temporary foreign worker and verify that the hire will have either a neutral or positive impact on Canada’s labour market.
	
根据魁北克政府的说法，这份名单影响的是受薪工人，而不是个体经营者，“适用于整个魁北克，并考虑到所有地区的劳动力需求。”在过去两年中，符合条件的职位数量增加了 100 多个职业。 2023 年符合条件的职业清单现在包括 300 多个职位，距 2021 年职位总数达到 181 个仅两年。	According to the Government of Quebec, the list, which affects salaried workers and not those who are self-employed, “applies to all of Quebec and takes into account the labour needs of all regions.” In the last two years, the number of eligible jobs has grown by more than 100 occupations. The list of eligible occupations for 2023 now includes over 300 job titles, just two years after being at 181 total positions in 2021.
	
**注意：**虽然 2023 年的职业清单于 2 月 24 日生效，但魁北克雇主及其代表获得了过渡宽限期，在此期间，LMIA 申请“可能会根据去年的合格职业清单进行审查。”此过渡期于 2023 年 3 月 24 日结束。	**Note:** Although the occupation list for 2023 took effect on February 24, Quebec employers and their representatives are granted a transitional grace period, during which LMIA applications “may be examined on the basis of last year’s eligible occupations list.” This transitional period ends on March 24, 2023.
	
### 与加拿大其他地区相比，魁北克的 LMIA 有何不同	How LMIAs differ in Quebec compared to the rest of Canada
	
魁北克雇主提出的 LMIA 申请必须得到省政府和联邦政府的批准。因此，总部位于魁北克的 LMIA 申请人必须“同时向两国政府提交 \[LMIA\] 申请”并提交所需文件。	LMIA applications made by employers in Quebec must be approved by both the provincial government and the federal government. Therefore, Quebec-based LMIA applicants must “simultaneously submit \[an LMIA\] application” to both governments and send in the required documents.
	
任何未同时向加拿大政府和魁北克政府提交的申请都将被拒绝。	Any applications that are not submitted simultaneously to the Government of Canada and the Government of Quebec will be rejected.
	
### LMIA 根据 NOC 2021 进行更改	LMIA changes in line with NOC 2021
	
自 2022 年对魁北克职业清单进行最后一次更新以来，加拿大移民、难民和公民身份 (IRCC) 已从 2016 年国家职业分类 (NOC 2016) 系统过渡到更新的 NOC 2021 版本。	Since the last update made to Quebec’s occupation list in 2022, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) has transitioned from the National Occupation Classification 2016 (NOC 2016) system to an updated NOC 2021 version.
	
正如魁北克政府所指出的那样，根据这一转变，“LMIA 申请在 [2022 年 11 月 16 日或之后]](https://www.quebec.ca/emploi/embauche-et-gestion- de-personnel/recruter/embaucher-immigrant/embaucher-travailleur-etranger-temporaire/traitement-simplifie/preparer-demande-eimt-canada) 将根据 NOC 2021 进行处理。”现在是 2023 年 3 月，所有申请都将使用更新后的 NOC 2021 系统进行处理。	In line with this transition, as noted by the Government of Quebec, “LMIA applications received [on or after \[November 16, 2022\]](https://www.quebec.ca/emploi/embauche-et-gestion-de-personnel/recruter/embaucher-immigrant/embaucher-travailleur-etranger-temporaire/traitement-simplifie/preparer-demande-eimt-canada) will be processed according to NOC 2021.” As it is now March 2023, all applications will be processed using the updated NOC 2021 system.
	
### 魁北克简化 LMIA 处理的一般资格条件	General eligibility conditions for simplified LMIA processing in Quebec
	
魁北克省概述了所有寻求通过简化的 LMIA 雇用外国工人的雇主必须满足的三个一般条件。	The province of Quebec outlines three general conditions that must be met by all employers seeking to hire foreign workers through a simplified LMIA.
	
**1\.提供有竞争力的工作条件**	**1\. Offer competitive working conditions**
	
从薪水到工作条件，魁北克雇主必须提供一个“等同”于加拿大公民或永久居民“从事类似工作\[在那个\]部门”所提供的工作环境。	From salary to working conditions, Quebec employers must offer a working environment that is “equivalent” to what is offered to a Canadian citizen or permanent resident “for a similar job \[in that\] sector.”
	
在他们的 LMIA 申请中，雇主必须以反映“已在 \[特定\] 领域就业的人员的条件和要求”的方式描述所提供的工作。	In their LMIA application, employers are required to describe the job offered in a way that reflects the “conditions and requirements of people already employed in \[a particular\] field.”
	
**2\。遵守法律法规**	**2\. Comply with laws and regulations**
	
寻求简化流程的 LMIA 的雇主需要证明他们的业务：	Employers seeking an LMIA with simplified processing are required to prove that their business:

魁北克雇主必须提供免费医疗保险，包括紧急护理，直到受雇工人有资格获得魁北克医疗保险 (RAMQ) 的保险。	Quebec employers must provide free medical coverage, including for urgent care, until the hired worker is eligible for coverage from the Régie de l’assurance maladie du Québec (RAMQ).
	
### 魁北克省低薪职位的附加资格标准	Additional eligibility criteria for low-wage positions in Quebec
	
提供低薪职位的雇主——每小时工资低于魁北克的中位数（25 美元）——除上述条件外，还必须满足以下三个条件：	Employers offering a low-wage position – where the hourly wage is less than the median in Quebec ($25) – must meet the following three conditions in addition to the above:
	
**1\.住房**	**1\. Housing**
	
雇主必须要么帮助他们的临时工找到“合适且负担得起的住房”，要么为他们提供。	Employers must either help their temporary workers find “suitable and affordable housing” or provide it for them.

**3\。健康保险**	**3\. Health insurance**
	
除了上述健康保险条件外，低薪工人必须得到与 RAMQ 计划相同的保险范围的支持，直到他们有资格获得 RAMQ 保险。	In addition to the above health insurance conditions, low-wage workers must be supported by coverage that is equal to that of the RAMQ plan until they are eligible for RAMQ coverage.
	
### 简化的 LMIA 处理排除	Simplified LMIA processing exclusions
