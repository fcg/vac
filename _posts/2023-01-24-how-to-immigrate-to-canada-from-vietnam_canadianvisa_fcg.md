您是否正在考虑从越南搬到加拿大？如果是这样，那么您来对地方了！加拿大是世界上最多元化和最热情的国家之一，为越南人提供广泛的移民选择。在此博客中，我们将探讨如何从越南移民到加拿大，以及抵达后会发生什么。让我们开始吧！	Are you considering a move to Canada from Vietnam? If so, you've come to the right place! Canada is one of the world's most diverse and welcoming countries and offers a wide range of immigration options for people from Vietnam. In this blog, we'll explore how you can immigrate to Canada from Vietnam and what to expect once you arrive. Let's get started!
	
加拿大一直是全球移民的热门目的地，越南也不例外。因此，近年来加拿大的越南移民激增，截至加拿大 2021 年人口普查，有超过 275,500 名越南人居住在加拿大。凭借其开放的移民政策和对新移民的欢迎态度，加拿大是希望开始新生活的越南人的理想目的地。	Canada has always been an attractive destination for immigrants worldwide, and Vietnam is no exception. As a result, Canada has seen a surge in immigration from Vietnam in recent years, with over 275,500 people from Vietnam living in Canada as of the Canadian 2021 census. With its open immigration policies and welcoming attitude towards newcomers, Canada is the perfect destination for Vietnamese people looking to start a new life.
	
加拿大永久居留计划	Canadian Permanent Residency Programs
	
!加拿大永久居留计划	!Canadian Permanent Residency Programs
	
如果你想让加拿大成为你余生的家，几个永久居留计划可以帮助你实现这一飞跃。它们如下：	If you want to make Canada your home for the rest of your life, several permanent residency programs can help you take that leap. They are as follows:
	
### 快速通道系统	The Express Entry System
	
自 2015 年以来，快速入境系统一直是加拿大最高效、最成功的移民系统。该计划向符合特定标准的越南人授予永久居留身份。这种身份使您可以不受任何限制地在加拿大生活和工作。此外，您还可以享受加拿大公民享有的许多福利，例如医疗保健和教育。	The Express Entry System has been Canada's most efficient and successful immigration system since 2015. This program grants permanent residency status to people from Vietnam who meet specific criteria. This status allows you to live and work in Canada without any restrictions. In addition, it gives you access to many benefits Canadian citizens enjoy, such as health care and education.
	
快速入境 (EE) 系统管理着三个联邦经济移民计划，可帮助熟练的外国工人在短短六个月内找到前往加拿大的途径。这三个程序如下：	Managing three federal economic immigration programs, the Express Entry (EE) system helps skilled foreign workers find their pathway to Canada in as little as six months. These three programs are as follows:
	
* 联邦技术工人计划 (FSWP)	  The Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP)
	
* 该项目专门针对从事通常需要学位的职业的外籍人士，例如软件开发人员、医生或律师。	  This program is specifically for foreign nationals working in an occupation that generally requires a degree, like a software developer, doctor or lawyer.
	
* 联邦技术贸易计划 (FSTP)	  The Federal Skilled Trades Program (FSTP)
	
* 该计划旨在帮助电工、屠夫或水管工等技术工人移民加拿大。	  This program was created to help skilled trade workers like electricians, butchers, or plumbers immigrate to Canada.
	
* 加拿大经验类 (CEC)	  The Canadian Experience Class (CEC)
	
* 该项目适用于在加拿大工作至少一年并满足快速通道系统一般要求的申请人。	  This program is for applicants who have worked in Canada for at least one year as well as meet the general requirements of the Express Entry System.
	
要申请此计划，您必须在加拿大政府网站上创建快速入境档案。创建此个人资料时，您将输入某些符合条件的信息，例如您的：	To apply for this program, you must create an Express Entry Profile on the Canadian government site. When you create this profile, you will enter certain qualifying information like your:
	
*   年龄	  Age
*   婚姻状况	  Marital Status
* 资格	  Qualifications
* 工作经验，以及	  Work Experience, and
* 与加拿大的联系。	  Connections to Canada.
	
这些因素通过综合排名系统 (CRS) 进行评分以生成 CRS 分数。这是 CRS 评分因素的完整细分。	These factors are scored via the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) to produce a CRS score. Here's a full breakdown of the CRS scoring factors.
	
然后将这些分数放入快速通道池中。加拿大政府每两周举行一次“快速通道”抽签，最符合条件的申请人将收到加拿大永久居留申请邀请 (ITA)。	These scores are then placed into an Express Entry pool. Every two weeks, the Canadian government holds an Express Entry draw, where the most eligible applicants receive an Invitation to Apply (ITA) for permanent residence in Canada.
	
申请人有 60 天的时间提交其佐证文件并完成申请。一旦他们的申请得到处理，他们将收到永久居留卡。	Applicants have 60 days to submit their corroborating documentation and complete their application. Once their application is processed, they will receive their permanent residence card.
	
### 省提名项目	Provincial Nominee Programs
	
省提名计划 (PNP) 帮助在加拿大 13 个省和地区的特别需求的工作部门中有资格和经验的国际工人。	The Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) helps international workers who are qualified and experienced in specifically in-demand job sectors of 13 of Canada's provinces and territories.
	
您可以直接向您选择的省份申请，也可以通过在创建快速入境资料时在特定省份创建意向书 (EOI)，通过快速入境系统申请。根据每个省的不同需求，每个省都有几个 PNP 流。如果您选择的省份需要您的技能，您很可能会获得永久居留权的省提名。省提名可以为你的 CRS 分数增加 600 分，保证你在下一次快速通道抽签时获得 ITA。	You can apply directly to your chosen province or via the Express Entry System by creating an Expression of Interest (EOI) in a specific province when you create your Express Entry profile. Each province has several PNP streams based on the different needs of each province. If your skills are needed in your chosen province, you will likely receive a provincial nomination for permanent residency. A provincial nomination can add up to 600 points to your CRS score, guaranteeing you receive an ITA at the next Express Entry Draw.
	
确定所选省份是否需要您的技能的一个好方法是查看每个省份目前需要哪些工作。这张地图显示了每个省的紧缺职业，以帮助您找到最需要您的地方。	An excellent way to determine if your skills are required in your chosen province is to see which jobs are currently in demand in each province. This map shows each province's in-demand occupations to help you find where you're needed most.

### 家庭赞助计划	Family Sponsorship Programs
	
如果您有配偶、伴侣或近亲居住在加拿大，他们可以担保您的永久居留权，前提是他们：	If you have a spouse, partner or close relative living in Canada, they may be able to sponsor your permanent residence, provided they are:
	
* 18岁以上	  Over the age of 18
* 加拿大公民或永久居民	  Either a Canadian citizen or permanent resident
* 拥有足够的资金来照顾您在加拿大期间的生活。	  In possession of sufficient funds to take care of you while in Canada.

* 配偶和家庭赞助	  Spousal and family sponsorships
* 父母和祖父母的赞助，以及	  Parents and Grandparents sponsorships, and
* 近亲赞助。	  Close relative sponsorships.

While a visa will only allow you a few benefits of permanent residency, it's a fantastic way to get your start in Canada and help you become eligible for programs like the CEC.
