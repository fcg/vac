# 了解为什么某些人可能不被允许进入加拿大以及克服不可入境的方法到达加拿大或已经居住在该国的个人可能因医疗或犯罪原因而被禁止入境。了解在医学上和刑事上不允许进入加拿大意味着什么，以及如何克服它。	Understanding why some people might not be allowed in Canada and ways to overcome inadmissibility Individuals arriving in Canada or already living in the country may be inadmissible on medical or criminal grounds. Find out what it means to be medically and criminally inadmissible to Canada and how to overcome it.
当某人不被加拿大接纳时，这是因为检查官已经决定被评估的人正在或将对公共健康和/或安全构成威胁或负担。	When someone is inadmissible to Canada, it is because the examining officer has decided that the person being assessed is or will be a threat to, or burden on, public health and/or safety.
	
不可入境的概念有很多复杂之处，但在基本层面上，不可入境属于几个一般类别，包括医疗/健康和刑事。	There are many intricacies to the concept of inadmissibility but on a basic level, inadmissibility falls under a few general categories, including medical/health and criminal.
	
当一个人被认为对公共健康构成威胁、对公共安全构成威胁或对健康和社会服务有过度需求的人时，就会发生医疗不可入境。	Medical inadmissibility occurs when an individual is considered a danger to public health, a threat to public safety, or someone who will place excessive demand on health and social services.
	
- 危害公众健康：根据体检结果和健康史，确定个人的健康状况是否会危害公众健康	-   Danger to public health: Using medical exam results and health history, a determination will be made about whether the individual’s health condition will endanger public health
- 对公共安全的危害：在评估个人突然精神或身体丧失行为能力的可能性以及不可预测或暴力行为的风险后，官员将决定是否应将他们视为健康方面的公共安全威胁	-   Danger to public safety: After assessing an individual’s potential for sudden mental or physical incapacity as well as their risk of unpredictable or violent behaviour, officers will decide whether they should be deemed a public safety threat due to their health
- 对健康/社会服务的过度需求：如果根据本条款不可接受，将决定此人的健康状况会对服务等待时间产生负面影响或需要过度支出，因为“治疗和管理健康所需的服务”会使这些服务不堪重负条件可能会花费超过过度需求成本阈值”	-   Excessive demand for health/social services: If inadmissible under this provision, it will have been decided that the person’s health condition will strain these services by negatively affecting service wait times or requiring excessive spending because “the services needed to treat and manage the health condition would likely cost more than the excessive demand cost threshold”
	
**注意：**根据加拿大政府的说法，2022 年的过度需求成本门槛为每年 24,057 美元（五年内为 120,285 美元）	**Note:** According to the Canadian government, the 2022 excessive demand cost threshold was $24,057 per year ($120,285 over five years)
	
刑事不可入境发生在个人在加拿大境外实施的行为在发生的国家和加拿大均属犯罪的情况下。因刑事原因不能进入加拿大也可能意味着有关人员犯下了两项或多项在加拿大属于“简易程序”的罪行。在这两种情况下，做出不可受理决定的唯一要求是有可靠的不当行为证据。	Criminal inadmissibility occurs in situations where an individual has committed an act outside Canada that is an offence in both the country in which it took place and in Canada. Being criminally inadmissible to Canada could also mean that the person in question committed two or more crimes that are ‘summary’ offences in Canada. In both cases, the only requirement for an inadmissibility decision is credible evidence of wrongdoing.
	
虽然加拿大的不可入境通常是由于外国相当于违反加拿大刑法，但违反任何加拿大联邦法律的外国犯罪也可能导致不可入境。	Although inadmissibility to Canada is most often caused by the foreign equivalent of a Canadian Criminal Code infraction, a foreign offence that violates any Canadian federal law can also result in inadmissibility.
	
### 克服刑事定罪和加拿大不可入境问题	Overcoming criminal convictions and inadmissibility to Canada
	
除了不予受理的听证会外，外国国民还有多种方法可以克服刑事定罪并进入加拿大。	Beyond an inadmissibility hearing, there are several ways for a foreign national to overcome a criminal conviction and enter Canada.
	
**视为康复**	**Deemed rehabilitation**
	
如果审查移民官员确信自从有关外国国民被定罪以来已经过了足够的时间，他们现在已经改过自新，则可能会允许该人返回加拿大。	If the examining immigration officer is convinced that enough time has passed since the foreign national in question was convicted of their crime that they are now rehabilitated, the individual may be allowed back into Canada.
	
重要的是要注意，视同改过自新是根据具体情况逐案评估的，具体取决于所犯的罪行、个人因犯罪服完刑期后所经过的时间以及该人是否犯下了更多罪行不止一种犯罪。	It is important to note that deemed rehabilitation is assessed on a case-by-case basis depending on the crime that was committed, the amount of time that has passed since the individual finished serving their sentence for the crime and whether the person has committed more than one crime.
	
视同改过自新也仅适用于在加拿大境外犯下的罪行若在加拿大境内犯下的刑期少于 10 年的情况。	Deemed rehabilitation is also only applicable if the crime committed outside of Canada would carry a prison term of fewer than 10 years if it were to be committed within Canadian borders.
	
**个人康复**	**Individual rehabilitation**
	
个人改过自新要求外国公民满足概述的改过自新标准，并且被认为极不可能再犯罪。	Individual rehabilitation requires the foreign national to meet the outlined criteria for rehabilitation and be considered highly unlikely to commit further crimes.
	
注意：自外国公民犯下使其无法进入加拿大申请个人康复的罪行之日起，必须已过去五年。同样，个人的刑事判决（包括缓刑）完成后必须至少已过去五年。	Note: Five years must have passed since the day that the foreign national committed the crime that made them inadmissible to Canada to apply for individual rehabilitation. Likewise, it must have been at least five years since the completion of the individual’s criminal sentence (including probation).
	
**记录暂停/出院**	**Record suspension/discharge**
	
以前称为赦免，加拿大假释委员会的记录暂停将使该外国国民不再被加拿大禁止入境。在其他国家/地区收到的记录暂停/释放在加拿大也可能有效。	Formerly known as a pardon, a record suspension from the Parole Board of Canada would make the foreign national no longer inadmissible to Canada. Record suspensions/discharges received in other countries may also be valid in Canada.
	
**法律意见书**	**Legal opinion letter**
	
法律意见书可以帮助试图进入加拿大的外国公民，允许律师代表他们发言，向移民或边境服务官员解释为什么外国公民实际上并非不允许进入加拿大。	A legal opinion letter can aid foreign nationals attempting to enter Canada by allowing a lawyer to speak on their behalf, explaining to an immigration or border services officer why the foreign national is not actually inadmissible to Canada.
	
这些信函根据加拿大法律对外国国民的犯罪行为进行法律分析，有助于说服审查人员尽管有犯罪历史，但该人仍应被加拿大接纳。	Offering a legal analysis of the foreign national’s crime in the context of Canadian law, these letters can help convince examining officers that the individual should be admissible to this country despite their criminal history.
	
**临时居留许可**	**Temporary Resident Permit**
	
临时居留许可 (TRP) 允许外国公民在有正当理由留在加拿大的情况下进入或留在加拿大。	A Temporary Resident Permit (TRP) allows foreign nationals to enter or stay in Canada if they have valid reasons to be in the country.
	
TRP 由审查移民或边境服务官员自行决定提供，他们必须确信个人进入或留在加拿大的理由超过对加拿大人的健康或安全风险。因此，官员可以随时取消 TRP。	TRPs are provided at the discretion of the examining immigration or border services officer, who must feel confident that an individual’s reason to enter or stay in Canada outweighs the health or safety risks to Canadians. Accordingly, TRPs can be cancelled by an officer at any time.
	
### 我有哪些选择？	What are my options?
	
不可入境可能是加拿大移民环境中一个令人困惑的部分。因此，咨询一位经验丰富的加拿大移民律师，讨论不被加拿大接纳的人可以使用的选择和可能的补救措施可能是有益的。	Inadmissibility may be a confusing part of the Canadian immigration landscape. Therefore, it could be beneficial to consult with an experienced Canadian immigration lawyer to discuss the options and potential remedies available to people who are inadmissible to this country.
	
经验丰富的移民律师可以：	An experienced immigration lawyer can:
	
- 帮助准备 TRP 和/或康复申请	-   Help prepare a TRP and/or Rehabilitation applications
- 提供法律意见书	-   Provide a legal opinion letter
- 确保申请人避免错误	-   Ensure applicants avoid mistakes
- 代表申请人向加拿大政府作出回应	-   Respond on an applicant’s behalf to the Canadian government
- 利用他们的专业知识避免在不同的申请步骤和申请处理过程中出现不必要的延误	-   Use their expertise to avoid unnecessary delays throughout the different application steps and application processing
