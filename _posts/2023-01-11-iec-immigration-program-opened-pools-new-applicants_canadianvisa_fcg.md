如果您考虑过探索加拿大，但不是永久探索，那么我们从加拿大政府本身那里收到了一些令人振奋的消息。	If you have thought of exploring Canada, but not on a permanent basis, then we have some exciting news for you received from the Canadian government itself.
	
什么是加拿大国际经验？	What Is International Experience Canada?
	
International Experience Canada 是 IRCC 内的一个组织，它向希望探索这个国家同时也在临时工作的加拿大新移民签发 ITA。它的主要功能是作为一个打工度假签证项目，允许来自大约30个国家的年轻人在加拿大工作和旅行。	International Experience Canada is an organization within the IRCC that issues ITAs to newcomers to Canada who wish to explore the country while also working on a temporary basis. Its main function is as a working holiday visa program that allows youth from around 30 countries to work and travel in Canada.
	
除了打工度假签证外，IEC 还为在申请前在加拿大有工作安排的个人提供青年专业人士签证。最后，还有一个国际合作项目，面向已安排在加拿大参加合作项目的学生。	Besides working holiday visas, the IEC also offers a young professionals visa for individuals with working arrangements for a job in Canada prior to making an application. Lastly, there is an international co-op program for students who have arranged to be placed into a co-operative program in Canada.
	
RCIC 代表已申请工作假期、青年专业人员或国际合作项目的客户与 IEC 联络，并安排他们及时、适当地向 IEC 提交申请。	The RCIC liaises with the IEC on behalf of clients who have applied for a Working Holiday, Young Professionals or International Co-Operative program and makes arrangements for them to submit their applications to the IEC in a timely and proper manner.
	
每年邀请多少人申请打工度假签证？	How Many People Are Invited To Apply For A Working Holiday Visa Per Year?
	
IEC 通常会为他们每年希望获得的打工度假签证人数设定一个目标。去年，IEC 收到了大约 80,000 份邀请，这一统计数据使他们的录取目标回到了大流行前的水平。对于 2023 赛季，IEC 将他们的入学目标目标提高了 20%。	The IEC usually sets a target for the number of working holiday visa admissions they want each year. Last year the IEC welcomed around 80,000 invitations, a statistic that brought back their admission targets to pre-pandemic levels. For the 2023 season, the IEC has set a 20% increase in their admission target goals.
	
这相当于预计 2023 年将有 90,000 名来自全球约 30 个国家/地区的青年入学。这是最近从 IEC 的官方推特帐户上宣布的。	This equates to an expected increase of 90,000 youth to be admitted from around 30 countries around the world for 2023. This was announced recently from the official twitter account of the IEC.
	
2023 年入学要求是什么？	What Are The 2023 Admission Requirements?
	
对于希望通过工作假期签证计划移居加拿大的人，IRCC 为您提供了申请途径，而无需通过常规申请渠道的麻烦。如果您有兴趣申请此计划，则需要了解 2023 年的新要求。	For people looking to move to Canada on a Working Holiday Visa program, the IRCC has provided a pathway for you to apply without having to go through the hassle of regular application channels. If you’re interested in applying for this program then you will need to be aware of the new requirements for 2023.
	
您开始申请过程的必要要求是从在注册移民咨询公司或官方政府网站创建个人资料开始。一旦为您创建了具有相应评估 CRS 分数的 IEC 帐户，您将需要收到来自 IEC 的申请邀请 (ITA)。	The necessary requirement for you to begin the process of applying begins with the creation of a profile with a registered immigration consultancy or official government site. Once an IEC account has been created for you with a corresponding evaluated CRS score, you will need to receive an Invitation to Apply (ITA) from the IEC.
	
根据更新后的 2023 年要求，您需要在 10 天内接受 ITA，该截止日期将包含在您的邀请中。如果您在给定的截止日期内接受 ITA，您将获得另一个 20 天的截止日期来在线申请工作许可。	With the updated 2023 requirements, you will need to accept the ITA within 10 days, a deadline which will be included in your invitation. Should you accept the ITA within the given deadline, another deadline of 20 days will be given to you to apply for a work permit online.
	
如需了解在 20 天截止日期前接受邀请的详细流程，您可以在线查看官方政府网站。	For a step by step breakdown of the process of accepting your invitation before the 20 day deadline expires you can view the official government site online.
	
如果截止日期在您能够接受邀请之前到期，那么您将需要通过创建新的 IEC 配置文件重新申请，再次被接受到池中，然后才会被考虑用于未来的 ITA。	If the deadline expires before you’re able to accept the invitation then you will need to reapply through the creation of a new IEC profile, get accepted into the pool again and only then will be considered for future ITAs.
	
如果您希望拒绝邀请但犹豫不决，担心这样做会使您无法再收到未来的邀请，那么您不必再担心了。 IEC 将保留您的候选资格和未来邀请的资格，即使您现在选择拒绝邀请。	Should you wish to decline an invitation but are hesitant to do so for fear that doing so will exclude you from receiving future invitations, then you can fear no longer. The IEC will retain your candidacy and eligibility for future invitations even if you opt to decline one for now.
	
有时您的申请可以被多个池接受，但 ITA 将针对一个类别发给您。如果发生这种情况，则意味着您将不再有资格从另一个池中获得另一个 ITA，除非您拒绝初始邀请或您的工作许可申请被拒绝。	Sometimes your application can be accepted in more than one pool but an ITA will be issued to you for one category. If this happens then it means that you will no longer be eligible to receive another ITA from a different pool unless you decline the initial invitation or your work permit application was refused.
	
如何确保满足申请截止日期和要求？	How To Ensure That You Meet Application Deadlines And Requirements?
	
支持您申请打工度假签证工作许可所需的文件。收集所需文档的过程可能是一项艰巨的任务。如果您在起草正确文件和提交截止日期指南方面需要帮助，请联系 RCIC 或移民咨询公司。	The documentation needed to support your application for a Working Holiday Visa work permit. The process of gathering the required documentation can be a daunting task. Should you need assistance with drawing up the correct documentation and guidance with submission deadlines then contacting an RCIC or immigration consultancy company.
	
如果您被 IEC 池接受，您应该立即准备好您的文件，因为认证过程可能需要一段时间。如果您提前准备好所有这些文件，那么在 20 天的申请截止日期前提交您的工作许可申请和支持文件会容易得多。	Should you be accepted into the IEC pool, you should immediately get your documentation ready since the certification process can take a while. It is much easier to meet the 20 day application deadline to submit your work permit application with supporting documentation if you prepare all these documents in advance.
	
常见问题	FAQs
	
###打工度假签证项目提供什么样的工作？	What kind of work is offered by the Working holiday Visa program?
	
没有专门为打工度假签证计划列出的具体工作，但一般规则是它们往往需要很少甚至不需要经验，并且涉及某种形式的体力劳动。这些工作的例子包括农场工人、家庭护理人员、调酒师、清洁工等。	There are no specific jobs outlined solely for the Working Holiday Visa program but the general rule is that they tend to require very little to no experience and involve some form of menial labor. Examples of these jobs include farmhands, homecare workers, bartenders, cleaners etc.
	
### 工作假期的持续时间是多少？	What is the duration of the working holiday?
	
工作假期的持续时间为一到两年。但是，如果工作假期签证的接受者希望继续逗留，可以通过 IEC 安排延期。	The duration of the working holiday ranges between one to two years. However, an extension can be arranged for via the IEC should the recipient of the working Holiday Visa wish to continue their stay.
	
### 加拿大各省打工度假安排的差异	Differences in working holiday arrangements between Canadian provinces
	
申请人应注意，加拿大各省之间的工作假期安排存在差异。这些差异是由于该省不同的劳动力和技能短缺或需求造成的。因此，仔细查看每个省份的需求将告诉您哪个省份最适合您的需求。	Applicants should be aware that there are differences in working holiday arrangements between Canadian provinces. The differences are a result of the differing labor and skills shortage or needs of the province. Therefore a careful look at each province's needs will inform you on which province you would be most suitable for your needs.
