# IRCC 邀请 667 名候选人参加 Express Entry PNP-only 抽签 IRCC 举行了今年第三次 PNP-only 抽签。	IRCC invites 667 candidates in Express Entry PNP-only draw IRCC has held the third PNP-only draw of the year.
IRCC 今天举行了 2023 年第六次快速通道抽签。	IRCC held the sixth Express Entry draw of 2023 today.
	
加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 向 667 名综合排名系统 (CRS) 最低分数为 748 分的候选人发出了邀请。	Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) issued invitations to 667 candidates with a minimum Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) score of 748.
	
这是继 2 月 15 日仅 PNP 抽签结果之后，2023 年第四次针对特定项目的抽签。其中三场针对 PNP 的抽签，另一场针对联邦技术工人计划 (FSWP)。	This was the fourth program-specific draw of 2023 following results of the PNP-only draw on February 15. Three of the program-specific draws have been for the PNP while one has been for the Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP).
	
### 自上次全节目抽签以来已有一个多月了	Over a month since the last all-program draw
	
由于 COVID-19 大流行导致的边境关闭和限制，所有项目的快速通道抽签在 2021 年 1 月至 2022 年 7 月期间暂停了 18 个月。 2022 年的所有抽签都是在 7 月之后进行的。	All-program Express Entry draws were paused for 18 months between January 2021 and July 2022 due to border closures and restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. All draws in 2022 were all-program after July.
	
自 2023 年初以来，IRCC 仅举行了两次全项目抽签，即根据最低 CRS 分数邀请了来自所有三个快速通道管理项目的候选人。这些抽奖每人邀请了 5,000 名候选人，并于 1 月 11 日至 18 日相隔一周举行。	Since the beginning of 2023, IRCC has held only two all program draws, meaning draws in which candidates from all three Express Entry managed programs were invited based on their minimum CRS score. Those draws each invited 5,000 candidates and were held one week apart on January 11 and 18.
	
然后，IRCC 等了两周才进行下一次抽签，这是自 2022 年 6 月以来首次仅 PNP 抽签。第二天，IRCC 又举行了一次抽签，仅邀请了来自联邦技术工人计划 (FSWP) 的 3,300 名候选人。这是自 2015 年 Express Entry 开始以来，IRCC 首次举行仅限 FSWP 的抽签。 FSWP 是最著名的快速通道计划之一，面向满足工作经验、语言和教育经验要求的海外候选人开放。	IRCC then waited two weeks for the next draw, which was the first PNP-only draw since June 2022. On the following day, IRCC held another draw, inviting 3,300 candidates from only the Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP). This was the first time since Express Entry began in 2015 that IRCC has held a FSWP-only draw. The FSWP is one of the most prominent Express Entry programs and open to candidates overseas who meet the work experience, language and educational experience requirements.
	
快速通道抽签完全由移民部长和 IRCC 自行决定。 《移民和难民保护法》中没有任何法律规定何时进行抽签、候选人人数或最低 CRS 截止分数。	Express Entry draws are totally at the discretion of the immigration minister and IRCC. There is no law in the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act that dictates when draws will occur, the number of candidates or the minimum CRS cut-off score.
	
### IRCC 启动快速通道程序的应用程序跟踪器	IRCC launches application tracker for Express Entry programs
	
2 月 8 日，IRCC 宣布联邦技术工人计划 (FSWP)、加拿大经验类移民 (CEC) 和联邦技术贸易计划 (FSTP) 的候选人现在可以在线监控他们的申请。它还将适用于省提名计划 (PNP) 的候选人。	On February 8, IRCC announced that candidates in the Federal Skilled Workers Program (FSWP), the Canadian Experience Class (CEC) and the Federal Skilled Trades Program (FSTP) will now be able to monitor their applications online. It will also apply to candidates in Provincial Nominee Programs (PNPs).
	
这些状态跟踪器将允许客户监控他们的应用程序，并随时了解有关保持文件移动可能需要的操作的任何更新。 1 月 31 日的数据显示，有 47,868 名 Express Entry 计划申请人在排队等候，66,214 名 PNP 申请人。	These status trackers will allow clients to monitor their application and stay informed on any updates regarding actions that may be required to keep their file moving. Data from January 31 shows 47,868 applicants for Express Entry programs waiting in the queue and 66,214 for PNPs.
	
IRCC 引入了这些跟踪器，作为提高透明度和改善信息访问的一种方式。去年，针对家庭类永久居留申请人、赞助商及其代表引入了相同的系统。	IRCC has introduced these trackers as a way to increase transparency and improve access to information. Last year, an identical system was introduced for family class permanent residence applicants, sponsors and their representatives.
	
### 什么是快速通道？	What is Express Entry?
	
Express Entry申请管理系统下共有三个加拿大移民项目：加拿大经验类项目（CEC）、联邦技术工人项目（FSWP）和联邦技工项目（FSTP）。快速通道池中的省提名计划 (PNP) 候选人已经有资格参加其中至少一项计划。	There are three Canadian immigration programs under the Express Entry application management system: the Canadian Experience Class (CEC), the Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP) and the Federal Skilled Trades Program (FSTP). Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) candidates in the Express Entry pool are already eligible for at least one of these programs.
	
使用基于积分的综合排名系统 (CRS) 对候选人进行快速入境计划评估，以对候选人的个人资料进行排名。得分最高的候选人将收到申请邀请 (ITA)，然后可以申请永久居留权。	Candidates are evaluated for Express Entry programs using the points-based Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS), to rank candidates’ profiles. Candidates with the highest scores will receive an Invitation to Apply (ITA) and can then apply for permanent residency.
	
候选人（现在是申请人）必须在 60 天内提出申请。提交申请后，IRCC 官员将审查并决定是否批准申请人。如果他们获得批准，申请人现在是加拿大的永久居民，并且可以在该国定居。	The candidates (now applicants) must then apply within 60 days. Once an application is submitted, an IRCC officer will review and decide whether an applicant is approved or not. If they are approved, the applicant is now a permanent resident of Canada, and may settle in the country.
