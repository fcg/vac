我的国家允许加拿大双重国籍吗？根据您所在国家/地区的政策，您可能有资格保留当前的公民身份并成为加拿大公民。	Does my country allow Canadian Dual Citizenship? Depending on your nation’s policies you may be eligible to keep your current citizenship status, and become a Canadian citizen.
	
许多在加拿大追求公民身份的移民能够同时持有两本护照，因为加拿大允许外国国民在持有加拿大护照的同时保留其原有公民身份。这称为双重国籍。	Many immigrants who pursue citizenship in Canada are able to hold two simultaneous passports, as Canada allows foreign nationals to maintain their original citizenship in addition to a Canadian one. This is called dual citizenship.
	
事实上，加拿大人失去加拿大公民身份既困难又复杂，这意味着归化到该国的移民将保留两个国籍——如果他们的原籍国允许的话。	In fact, it is difficult and complicated for Canadians to lose their Canadian citizenship, meaning that immigrants who naturalize to the country will maintain two nationalities—if their country of origin allows it.
	
### 双重国籍如何运作？	How does Dual Citizenship work?
	
双重国籍是指一个人同时持有两本不同的护照——进一步赋予他们两国公民的法律地位。	Dual citizenship refers to when an individual holds two different passports at the same time—further affording them the legal status of a citizen of both countries.
	
### 好处	Benefits
	
双重国籍最明显的好处是个人有资格享受两国的权利，包括社会计划、两国（和相关盟国）之间的旅行便利以及拥有财产的能力（以及其他自由）。	The most obvious benefit of dual citizenship is that an individual can be eligible for the rights of both countries, including social programs, ease of travel between both countries (and relevant allied countries), and the ability to own property (among other freedoms).
	
### 缺点	Drawbacks
	
然而，双重国籍也可能存在某些缺点。例如，有些人可能对两个国家都负有双重义务（税收、兵役等），这可能会很麻烦。此外，双重国籍的批准过程可能复杂而繁琐，官僚主义往往是延长处理周期的关键部分。	There can however be certain drawbacks to dual citizenship as well. For example, some individuals may be under dual obligations to both countries (taxes, military service, etc.), which can be troublesome. In addition, the process of dual citizenship approval can be complicated and cumbersome, with bureaucracy often being a key part of an extended processing period.
	
### 我的国家允许加拿大双重国籍吗？	Does my country allow for Dual Citizenship with Canada?
	
* 孟加拉国：虽然法律在技术上不允许，但加拿大公民的孟加拉国血统的个人可以向孟加拉国政府申请双重国籍证书 (DNC)。如果获得批准，这些人将拥有双重国籍。如果没有获得 DNC，孟加拉人将在成为入籍加拿大公民后失去公民身份。	  Bangladesh: Though not technically allowed by law, individuals of Bangladeshi origins who are citizens of Canada, may apply for a Dual Nationality Certificate (DNC) with the Bangladeshi government. If approved, these individuals will have dual citizenship. If a DNC is not obtained Bangladeshis will lose their citizenship upon becoming naturalized Canadian citizens.
	
* 印度：印度不允许拥有任何其他国家的双重国籍（如 1955 年印度公民法中所写）。在获得外国公民身份后申请、继续持有或获得印度护照被视为应受惩罚的罪行。获得加拿大公民身份的印度国民将没有资格获得双重国籍。	  India: India does not allow dual citizenship with any other country (as is written in the Indian Citizenship Act of 1955). It is considered a punishable offense to apply for, continue to hold or obtain an Indian passport after acquiring foreign citizenship. Indian nationals who obtain Canadian citizenship will not be eligible for dual citizenship.
	
* 尼日利亚：尼日利亚允许拥有其他国家的双重国籍，甚至可以在持有尼日利亚护照的情况下归化到另一个国家。但是，尼日利亚不允许已归化到另一个国家的人也归化到尼日利亚。因此，追求加拿大公民身份的尼日利亚国民将能够持有两本护照。	  Nigeria: Nigeria allows dual citizenship with other countries, and even naturalization to another country while holding a Nigerian passport. Nigeria does not, however, allow people who have naturalized into another country, to also naturalize to Nigeria. Nigerian nationals pursuing Canadian citizenship will therefore be able to hold two passports.
	
* 巴基斯坦：巴基斯坦不允许居住在国外的巴基斯坦国民拥有双重国籍。虽然该国确实与 19 个国家（包括加拿大）签订了双重国籍协议——允许这些国家的国民在保留其初始国籍的同时成为巴基斯坦人——但归化到另一个国家的巴基斯坦公民必须撤销其巴基斯坦公民身份。希望归化到加拿大的巴基斯坦公民必须放弃他们的巴基斯坦护照。	  Pakistan: Pakistan does not allow dual citizenship for Pakistani nationals living abroad. While the country does have dual citizenship agreements with 19 countries (including Canada)— allowing nationals of these countries to become Pakistani while maintaining their initial nationality—Pakistani citizens who naturalize to another country must revoke their Pakistani citizenship. Pakistani citizens looking to naturalize to Canada must give up their Pakistani passports.
	
* 菲律宾：菲律宾允许拥有加拿大双重国籍。已归化到其他国家的菲律宾国民可以申请保留或恢复其身份；如果他们在 1973 年之前出生并且在他们出生时至少有一位菲律宾父母。在加拿大出生的人，当时至少有一位父母是菲律宾人，将被视为双重公民。申请加拿大公民身份的菲律宾国民可以申请保留两本护照。	  Philippines: The Philippines allows dual citizenship with Canada. Filippino nationals who had been naturalized to other countries may apply to retain or regain their status; if they were born before 1973 and had at least one Filipino parent at the time of their birth. Individuals born in Canada, with at least one parent who is Filipino at the time, will already be considered dual citizens. Filipino nationals applying for Canadian citizenship can apply to retain both passports.
	
* 英国：英国确实允许拥有加拿大的双重国籍，这意味着英国公民可以在不影响其当前国籍的情况下寻求和利用加拿大公民身份。	  U.K: The U.K does allow dual citizenship with Canada, meaning that U.K. citizens can pursue and avail of Canadian citizenship without any impact on their current nationality.
	
* 美国：美国允许与包括加拿大在内的其他国家拥有双重国籍，这意味着美国国民可以自由地获得加拿大公民身份，而不会对其美国国籍产生任何影响。	  U.S.A: The United States allows dual citizenship with other countries, including Canada, meaning that U.S. nationals can freely pursue Canadian citizenship without any impact on their American nationality.
	
* 沙特阿拉伯：沙特阿拉伯不承认任何其他国家的双重国籍。此外，如果您被视为沙特阿拉伯公民，您可以合法地在沙特阿拉伯被拒绝加拿大领事服务。	  Saudi Arabia: Dual citizenship is not recognized in Saudi Arabia with any other country. Furthermore, if you are considered a Saudi Arabian citizen, you can lawfully be denied Canadian consular services in Saudi Arabia.
