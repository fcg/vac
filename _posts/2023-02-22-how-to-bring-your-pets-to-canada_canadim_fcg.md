几乎所有的家庭都会说他们认为宠物是家庭不可或缺的成员。因此，许多人想知道在调查加拿大移民时如何将他们的宠物带到加拿大。幸运的是，虽然对携带宠物移居加拿大的个人有某些要求和限制，但进口法允许将大多数家养宠物带入该国。	Nearly all families would say they consider their pets essential members of their families. And as such, many wonder how they can bring their pets to Canada with them when looking into Canadian immigration. Fortunately, while there are certain requirements and restrictions for individuals moving to Canada with pets, import laws allow most domestic pets to be brought into the country.
	
你有资格移民加拿大吗？	Do you qualify to immigrate to Canada?
	
**加拿大动物进口指南**	**Canadian Import Guidelines for Animals**
	
将您的宠物带到加拿大时，从技术上讲，您是在从事将动物进口到加拿大的工作。所有向加拿大进出口的动物均受加拿大食品检验局 (CFIA) 监管，该机构在加拿大所有入境口岸 (POE) 都有值班检验员，以监管动物的进口。确切的要求和限制因动物类型、物种、原产国、健康状况和进口目的而异，因此新移民在前往加拿大之前应务必查看 CFIA 网站。	When bringing your pet to Canada, you are technically engaging in the importation of animals to Canada. All import and export of animals to Canada are regulated by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) which has inspectors on duty at all Canadian ports of entry (POE) in order to regulate the import of animals. The exact requirements and restrictions vary depending on the type of animal, species, country of origin, health status, and purpose of import, so newcomers should be sure to check the CFIA website prior to travelling to Canada.
	
进口宠物的要求因上述因素而异。一些宠物主人可能需要获得允许他们将宠物带到加拿大的许可证，或者他们可能需要兽医出具的证明，证明他们的宠物没有疾病。在某些情况下，CFIA 代理人会在允许进入加拿大之前将宠物隔离一段时间。请确保您充分了解您的宠物的要求，以确保您在入境时不会遇到任何问题。	The requirements for importing pets vary according to the factors listed above. It may be necessary for some pet owners to obtain a permit allowing them to bring their pet to Canada, or they may require a certificate from a veterinarian stating that their pet has no diseases. In some cases, pets are held by CFIA agents in quarantine for certain periods of time prior to being allowed to enter Canada. Please be sure that you adequately understand the requirements for your pet in order to ensure you won’t have any problems entering the country.
	
以下是一些最常见的进口宠物的进口要求和限制，以及进口所有种类宠物的资源。	Below are the import requirements and restrictions for some of the most commonly imported pets, as well as resources for importing all varieties of pets.
	
**把你的狗带到加拿大**	**Bringing Your Dog to Canada**
	
虽然对狗的进口确实存在限制，但只要您的狗健康且没有疾病，只要您遵循适当的程序，您就应该能够将您的幼犬带到加拿大。	While restrictions do exist on the import of dogs, as long as your dog is healthy and disease free, you should be able to bring your pup to Canada as long as you follow the proper procedures.
	
### 个人与商业进口	Personal vs Commercial Import
	
将狗进口到加拿大的第一步是确定狗是出于个人用途还是商业用途进口：	The first step to importing dogs to Canada is determining if the dog is being imported for personal use or for commercial use:
	
**个人进口：**	**Personal Import:**  
进口加拿大居民个人拥有的狗（无论年龄大小）作为宠物；或作为服务犬，由指定人员陪同。	The import of a dog (regardless of age) that is personally owned by a Canadian resident as a pet; or as a service dog that is accompanied by the person to whom the dog is assigned.
	
**商业进口：**	**Commercial Import:**  
为销售、收养、繁殖、表演、展览、科学研究或动物福利组织而进口犬只。	The import of a dog for sale, adoption, breeding, show, exhibition, scientific research, or animal welfare organizations.
	
大多数宠物将被归类为个人进口，但如果您的狗没有和您一起旅行，或者如果一只狗被带到该国出售，那么该狗有资格作为商业进口，并且如果年龄超过8个月。许可证申请应在旅行前 30 天提交，并可在 CFIA 网站上获取。	The majority of pets will be classified as personal imports, but if your dog is not travelling with you, or if a dog is being brought into the country for sale, then the dog qualifies as a commercial import and will require a permit if older than 8 months. Applications for permits should be submitted 30 days prior to travel and can be accessed on the CFIA website.
	
符合个人进口条件的狗不需要许可证即可进入加拿大。然而，即使是个人进口的狗也需要一些文件。	Dogs who qualify as personal imports do not require a permit to enter Canada. However, even personally imported dogs will require some documentation.
	
### 狗所需的文件和检查	Documentation and Inspection Required for Dogs
	
所有进入加拿大的狗都需要提供所有必要疫苗的证明，具体取决于狗的年龄。进口时未满 3 个月的犬只不需要接种狂犬病疫苗。	All dogs entering Canada require proof of all necessary vaccines, depending on the age of the dog. A dog that is less than 3 months of age at the time of the import does not require rabies vaccination.
	
大多数进口到加拿大的狗将接受加拿大边境服务局 (CBSA) 的检查，该局在每个加拿大入境口岸 (POE) 都有代理人。同样，在某些情况下，狗可能需要 CFIA 代理人进行检查。狗主人应该使用 CFIA 自动进口参考系统 (AIRS) 来确定他们的狗是否需要 CFIA 检查并制定相应的计划。	Most dogs imported into Canada will undergo an inspection by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) which has agents at every Canadian port of entry (POE). As well, in certain circumstances, dogs may require inspection by a CFIA agent. Dog owners should use the CFIA Automated Import Reference System (AIRS) to determine if their dog will require a CFIA inspection and plan accordingly.
	
CBSA 对动物的检查费用为 31.27 美元 + 货物中第一只动物的税费，每多一只动物额外收取 5.21 美元 + 税费。如果一只狗不符合加拿大狂犬病认证的进口要求，那么它将被收取额外费用，并且需要在抵达后两周内接受狂犬病疫苗接种，费用由主人承担。	The CBSA inspection for animals is $31.27 + tax for the first animal in a shipment, plus an additional $5.21 + tax for each additional animal. If a dog does not meet Canada’s import requirements for rabies certification then it will be subject to additional fees and will be required to undergo vaccination against rabies at the owner’s expense within two weeks of arrival.
	
加拿大不要求作为私人宠物进口的狗有微芯片或纹身识别，但是，8 个月以下的商业类进口狗必须有电子微芯片识别。	Canada does not require a microchip or tattoo identification for dogs imported as personal pets, however, dogs under 8 months of age imported under the commercial category must be identified by an electronic microchip.
	
如果乘飞机前往加拿大，宠物主人应与他们的航空公司核实，因为许多航空公司将要求对狗提供额外的文件和旅行限制。	If travelling to Canada by plane, pet owners should check with their airline as many airlines will require additional documentation and travel restrictions for dogs.
	
考虑到所有这些，狗主人应该对自己将犬类朋友带到加拿大的能力充满信心。	With all of this in mind, dog owners should feel confident in their abilities to bring their canine friends along with them to Canada.
	
**把你的猫带到加拿大**	**Bringing Your Cat to Canada**
	
加拿大对我们的猫科动物同行确实有一些限制和要求，但只要您遵循规定的程序，将您的猫带到加拿大应该没有任何问题。	Canada does have some restrictions and requirements for our feline counterparts, but as long as you follow the required procedure, you shouldn’t have any trouble bringing your cat with you to Canada.
	
### 狂犬病疫苗接种要求	Rabies Vaccination Requirements
	
进口猫的最大健康和安全问题是病毒性疾病狂犬病的传播。出于这个原因，所有将家猫带到加拿大的猫主人都必须准备好证明他们的猫没有这种疾病。猫主人可以采取两种方法：	The biggest health and safety concern with the import of cats is the transmission of the viral disease, rabies. For this reason, all cat owners bringing their domestic cats to Canada must be prepared to prove their cat is free of the disease. There are two methods cat owners can take:
	
**狂犬病疫苗接种证书：** 猫主人可以从他们的兽医处获得证明他们的猫已接种狂犬病疫苗这一事实的证书。该证书的具体要求列在 CFIA 网站上。只要包含所有必需的信息，欧盟宠物护照也是可以接受的替代方案。	**Rabies Vaccination Certificate:** A cat owner can obtain a certificate from their veterinarian attesting to the fact that their cat has received the rabies vaccine. The exact requirements for this certificate are listed on the CFIA website. The European Union pet passport is an acceptable alternative as long as all required information is included.
	
**兽医证书：**从无狂犬病国家带猫的猫主人可以获得兽医证书，证明宠物是从在前往加拿大之前的六个月内未发生狂犬病的国家进口的。	**Veterinary Certificate:** Cat owners bringing cats from a rabies-free country may obtain a veterinary certificate attesting to the fact that the pet is being imported from a country where rabies has not occurred within the six months preceding the travel to Canada.
	
如果猫没有按照进口要求进行认证，主人将被要求在规定的时间内自费为猫注射狂犬病疫苗，并将疫苗接种记录提供给CFIA办公室。	If a cat is not certified according to the import requirements, the owner will be required, at their own expense, to have the cat vaccinated against rabies within a specified period of time and provide the vaccination record to a CFIA office.
	
### 猫所需的文件和检查	Documentation and Inspection Required for Cats
	
3 个月以下的猫免于进口限制，但所有 3 个月以上的猫都必须遵守进口要求。猫进入加拿大时无需隔离，也不需要健康证明或进口许可证。	Cats less than 3 months in age are exempt from import restrictions, but all cats older than 3 months are subject to import requirements. Cats do not have to be quarantined when entering Canada, nor do they require a health certificate or import permit.
	
家猫唯一需要的文件是关于狂犬病的预防措施。猫必须有文件证明它们没有狂犬病并且已经正确接种疫苗或来自没有狂犬病的国家。	The only document required for domestic cats is a preventative measure regarding rabies disease. Cats are required to have documentation showing they are rabies free and have been properly vaccinated or are from a rabies-free country.
	
大多数进口到加拿大的猫都会接受加拿大边境服务局 (CBSA) 的检查，该局在每个加拿大入境口岸 (POE) 都有代理人。携带猫旅行时无需提前通知边境人员，因为总会有授权人员进行此类检查。	Most cats imported into Canada will undergo an inspection by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) which has agents at every Canadian port of entry (POE). It is not necessary to notify border agents in advance of travel with cats, as there will always be an agent authorized to perform such an inspection.
	
CBSA 对动物的检查是对货物中的第一只动物收取 30 美元 + 税费，每多一只动物额外收取 5 美元 + 税费。如果一只猫不符合加拿大狂犬病认证的进口要求，那么它将被收取额外费用，并且需要在抵达后两周内接受狂犬病疫苗接种，费用由主人承担。	The CBSA inspection for animals is $30 + tax for the first animal in a shipment, plus an additional $5 + tax for each additional animal. If a cat does not meet Canada’s import requirements for rabies certification then it will be subject to additional fees and will be required to undergo vaccination against rabies at the owner’s expense within two weeks of arrival.
	
加拿大不要求对宠物猫进行微芯片或纹身识别。如果乘飞机前往加拿大，宠物主人应与他们的航空公司核实，因为许多航空公司将需要额外的文件和猫的旅行限制。	Canada does not require a microchip or tattoo identification for pet cats. If travelling to Canada by plane, pet owners should check with their airline as many airlines will require additional documentation and travel restrictions for cats.
	
如果一只猫不是家猫，它将受到一套不同的要求。非家猫主人应咨询 CFIA 自动进口参考系统 (AIRS) 以确定进口要求。	If a cat is not domestic, it will be subject to a different set of requirements. Non-domestic cat owners should consult the CFIA Automated Import Reference System (AIRS) to determine import requirements.
	
考虑到所有这些，猫主人应该有信心带着他们的猫科动物朋友一起踏上加拿大的新生活之旅。	With all of this in mind, cat owners should feel confident bringing their feline friends along on their journey to a new life in Canada.
	
**将其他宠物带到加拿大**	**Bringing Other Pets to Canada**
	
对于那些希望与其他宠物一起旅行的家庭，CFIA 对所有类型的宠物进口都有具体要求。要详细了解您的宠物的要求，请在此处查阅 CFIA 的资源。	For those families wishing to travel with other pets, the CFIA has specific requirements for all types of pet imports. To learn more about the requirements for your pet, consult the CFIA’s resource here.
	
**为移居加拿大做准备的一般提示**	**General Tips to Prepare for Your Move to Canada**
	
虽然要求和因素可能会因上述因素而有所不同，但在考虑如何将您的宠物带到加拿大时，可以考虑一些一般性提示。	While the requirements and factors can vary a bit depending on the factors listed above, there are some general tips to think about when considering how to bring your pet to Canada.
	
1. 确保在您计划的旅行日期之前收集所有适当的**文件**，以确保您拥有所需的一切。将动物带入加拿大的一些最常见的表格和文件包括：	1.  Make sure to gather all appropriate **documentation** well in advance of your planned travel date to ensure you have everything you need. Some of the most commonly required forms and documentation for animals being brought into Canada include:
* 狂犬病疫苗接种证明（适用于来自未被认定为无狂犬病国家的哺乳动物）	    *   Certification of Rabies vaccination (for mammals from countries that aren’t recognized as rabies-free)
* 兽医证书（适用于来自公认无狂犬病国家的哺乳动物）	    *   A veterinary certificate (for mammals from countries that are recognized as rabies-free)
* 宠物年龄证明（特别适用于需要狂犬病疫苗但小于 3 个月大的宠物）	    *   Proof of your pet’s age (specifically for pets that would require a rabies vaccine but are younger than 3 months old)
* 禽流感兽医证书（适用于从美国以外国家/地区进口的鸟类）	    *   Veterinary certificates against Avian Influenza (for birds being imported from countries outside of the United State)
2. 请务必**咨询您的兽医**以确保您的宠物健康到可以旅行。搬到一个新的国家对每个相关人员来说都是有压力的，包括您的动物伙伴。请务必咨询您的兽医以确保您宠物的健康，并听取他们关于携带宠物旅行的最佳和最健康方式的建议。	2.  Be sure to **check with your vet** to make sure that your pet is healthy enough to travel. Moving to a new country is stressful for everyone involved, including your animal companions. Make sure to check with your vet to ensure the health of your pet and get their recommendations on the best and healthiest ways to travel with your pet.
3. 确保您有适合您宠物的**旅行容器**。如果乘坐飞机等过境旅行，通常每个航空公司都会有关于宠物容器的具体指南。虽然这些有所不同，但请记住一些一般准则：	3.  Ensure that you have the proper **travel container** for your pet. If travelling by transit such as by plane, there are often specific guidelines that each airline will have regarding pet containers. While these vary there are some general guidelines to keep in mind:
* 您的宠物旅行容器应该让您的宠物有足够的空间站立、坐下、躺下和转身	    *   Your pets travel container should allow your pet enough room to stand, sit, lay down, and turn around
* 保持充足的通风	    *   Have plenty of ventilation
* 有一个水嘴或饮水机以防止脱水	    *   Have a water spout or dispenser to prevent dehydration
4. 如果要长途旅行，一定要想办法**让他们从容器中休息一下**。许多机场都有专门的区域供宠物使用卫生间、进食和伸展一下。旅行前最好仔细研究一下，这样您的宠物就不会在旅行箱中放置太久。	4.  If travelling for a long time, be sure to plan out ways to **give them a break from their containers**. Many airports have specific areas for pets to be let out to use the bathroom, eat and stretch a bit. It’s a good idea to look into this a bit before travelling so your pet isn’t kept in their travel case for too long of a duration.
