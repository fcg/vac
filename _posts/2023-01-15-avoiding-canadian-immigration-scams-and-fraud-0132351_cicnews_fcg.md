避免加拿大移民诈骗和欺诈 不幸的是，新的加拿大移民和未来的移民希望很容易受到各种诈骗/欺诈的攻击。以下是需要记住的三件事，它们将有助于现有和潜在的加拿大移民避免移民诈骗/移民欺诈的后果。	Avoiding Canadian immigration scams and fraud New Canadian immigrants and future immigration hopefuls are unfortunately very vulnerable to all kinds of scams/fraud. Here are three things to remember that will help existing and prospective Canadian immigrants avoid the consequences of an immigration scam/immigration fraud.
	
从 2022 年 11 月 14 日到 12 月 8 日，短短 24 天，CBC 报道了三起不同的加拿大移民诈骗案。	Between November 14 to December 8, 2022, a span of just 24 days, CBC reported on three different alleged Canadian immigration scams.
	
在埃德蒙顿，一名今年秋天从伊朗移居加拿大的康科迪亚大学学生因电话诈骗而损失了近 11,000 美元。 12 月初，有报道称一名加纳男子面临涉嫌社交媒体就业骗局，该骗局还索要与健康保险费有关的钱。值得庆幸的是，他很警惕，在汇款之前就意识到这是一个骗局。	In Edmonton, a Concordia University student who moved to Canada from Iran this fall lost nearly $11,000 to phone scammers. In early December, reports surfaced that a Ghanaian man faced an alleged social media employment scam that also asked for money related to a health insurance fee. Thankfully, he was vigilant and realized this was a scam before sending any money.
	
不幸的是，据称被温哥华移民顾问骗走“5000 美元或更多”的“数十名受害者”可能没有那么幸运。据称，这起骗局中的移民顾问现在已经对她提起了集体诉讼，她谎称自己是一名律师，并“承诺通过一个不存在的项目获得加拿大永久居留权”来欺骗移民。	Unfortunately, the “dozens of victims” who were allegedly each scammed out of “$5000 or more” by a Vancouver immigration consultant may not have been as lucky. It is alleged that the immigration consultant in this scam, who has now had a class action lawsuit filed against her, misrepresented herself as a lawyer and defrauded migrants “with promises of a path to permanent residence in Canada through a nonexistent program.”
	
提供以上示例都是为了概述加拿大移民诈骗在全国范围内的普遍情况。因此，以下概述了三件需要记住的事情，这些事情将帮助最近的加拿大移民和未来希望在加拿大工作、学习或移民的人避免成为移民欺诈或移民诈骗的受害者的严重后果。	The above examples were all provided to outline the prevalence of Canadian immigration scams across the country. Accordingly, the following outlines three things to remember that will help recent Canadian immigrants and future hopefuls looking to work, study or immigrate to this country avoid the harsh consequences of falling victim to immigration fraud or an immigration scam.
	
### IRCC 和罚款/费用的收取	IRCC and the collection of fines/fees
	
通过电话进行的移民诈骗和一般诈骗越来越普遍。事实上，根据 CityNews Vancouver 2022 年 1 月报道的一部分进行的一项民意调查，自 2019 年以来，广东话或普通话的诈骗电话增加了 20%。除此之外，据总部位于温哥华的研究公司总裁称Research Co.，60% 的手机用户接到假装是政府机构的诈骗电话。	It is increasingly common for immigration scams, and scams in general, to be perpetrated over the phone. In fact, according to a poll conducted as part of a January 2022 story from CityNews Vancouver, scam calls in Cantonese or Mandarin are up 20% since 2019. Adding to this is the fact that, according to the President of Vancouver-based research firm Research Co., 60% of cellphone users receive scam calls pretending to be part of a government agency.
	
为此，加拿大移民希望者了解加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 绝不会打电话给任何人或在线或亲自与他们联系以收取费用或罚款，以避免被驱逐出境等后果，这一点很重要。 IRCC 指出，诈骗者“通常会提供假名和代理号码以显得合法”，但敦促此类电话始终是骗局。	To this end, it is important for Canadian immigration hopefuls to understand that Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) will never call anyone or contact them either online or in-person to collect fees or fines to avoid consequences such as deportation. IRCC notes that scammers will “often give a fake name and agent number to appear legitimate” but urges that these types of calls are always a scam.
	
如果有人打电话威胁不付款或提供个人信息的后果，请不要害怕联系当地警方和/或报告事件。	Do not be afraid to contact local police and/or report the incident if someone calls and threatens consequences for not paying money or providing personal information.
	
### IRCC 的官方骗局/欺诈识别资源	IRCC’s official scam/fraud identification resources
	
移民到一个新的国家是一段旅程，需要移民找到他们可以依赖的信息。在互联网时代，不可靠的信息无处不在，因为几乎任何人都可以创建网站或博客，并声称自己是所选主题的专家。因此，官方政府资源是任何移民前往加拿大的关键。	Immigrating to a new country is a journey that requires immigrants to find information that they can rely on. In the age of the internet, unreliable information is everywhere because just about anyone can start a website or a blog and claim to be an expert on a subject of their choosing. For that reason, official government resources are key to any immigrant’s journey to Canada.
	
重要的是要记住，IRCC 还提供官方政府资源（常见问题解答和提示表），以帮助最近的加拿大移民和那些希望在未来来加拿大的人识别和避免与移民相关的欺诈和诈骗。	It is important to keep in mind that IRCC also offers official government resources (FAQs and tip sheets) to help recent Canadian immigrants and those looking to come to Canada in the future identify and avoid immigration-related fraud and scams.
	
无论某人是在寻找有关特定类型的欺诈/诈骗（电话/互联网诈骗、文件欺诈等）的信息，还是想了解如果他们成为诈骗/欺诈的受害者该怎么办，IRCC 都提供有关所有这些主题的广泛在线资源.这些工具将帮助新移民到加拿大和未来的加拿大移民希望者保持警惕并保护自己免受这些情况的影响。	Whether someone is seeking information on a particular type of fraud/scam (telephone/internet scams, document fraud etc.) or looking to understand what to do if they fall victim to a scam/fraud, IRCC provides extensive online resources on all these subjects. These tools will help both recent immigrants to Canada and future Canadian immigration hopefuls stay aware and protect themselves from these situations.
	
### 验证加拿大移民服务商的合法性	Verifying the legitimacy of Canadian immigration service providers
	
当来到一个新的国家时，移民往往需要其他人的帮助。根据移民/移民希望的选择，这种帮助可能来自在线论坛或移民顾问，例如移民律师、代表或顾问。尽管如此，就像任何人都可以通过网站将自己展示为在线主题专家一样，骗子也不难伪装成值得信赖和可靠的移民顾问。	When coming to a new country, immigrants often need help from other people. This help, depending on the choices made by the immigrant/immigration hopeful, may come from an online forum or an immigration advisor such as an immigration lawyer, representative or consultant. Still, similar to how anyone could present themselves as an online subject matter expert through a website, it is not difficult for scammers to pose as trustworthy and credible immigration advisors.
	
为了帮助最近的加拿大移民和未来的移民希望者管理这一点，加拿大官方登记处和名录的存在是为了验证声称他们有权代表移民/提供移民建议的个人的合法性。例如，所有加拿大公民和移民顾问都必须是移民和公民顾问学院的成员。同样，加拿大移民律师和公证人必须在加拿大省或地区法律协会注册，安大略省的律师助理必须成为安大略省法律协会的成员。	To help both recent Canadian immigrants and future immigration hopefuls manage this, official Canadian registries and directories exist to verify the legitimacy of individuals who claim they are authorized to represent immigrants/provide immigration advice. For instance, all Canadian citizenship and immigration consultants must be a member of the College of Immigration and Citizenship Consultants. Likewise, Canadian immigration lawyers and notaries must be registered with a Canadian provincial or territorial law society and Ontario-based paralegals are required to become members of the Law Society of Ontario.
	
IRCC 指出，大多数省和地区法律协会都提供在线工具来验证特定个人注册为会员是否信誉良好，而个人的“信誉”是移民是否应使用该移民律师服务的一个有价值的指标。	IRCC notes that most provincial and territorial law societies provide online tools to verify if a particular individual registers as a member in good standing, and an individual’s “standing” is a worthwhile indicator of whether immigrants should use the services of that immigration lawyer.
