“艾伯塔省继续为我们国家设定就业标准。我们的政府正在创造一个有利于商业的环境，以建立动力，支持高薪工作并进一步使我们的经济多样化。由于我们的努力，艾伯塔人正在繁荣发展，加拿大人正在关注这一点。创纪录水平的新移民正涌入我省，以利用我们日益繁荣的优势。“Alberta continues to set the standard for employment in our nation. Our government is creating a business-friendly climate that builds momentum, supports high-paying jobs and further diversifies our economy. Thanks to our efforts, Albertans are prospering, and Canadians are taking notice. Record levels of newcomers are moving to our province to take advantage of our growing prosperity.

“12 月份的数据证明，得益于我们强有力的经济和财政政策以及我们为吸引投资而采取的行动，我们的经济正在蓬勃发展并具有弹性。在一个月内，艾伯塔省新增了 41,000 多个全职工作岗位，到 2022 年将增加近 94,000 个全职工作岗位。大部分就业增长来自私营部门，建筑、制造、运输和仓储领域的增长尤为明显，技术、商业和医疗保健。在过去的一年里，艾伯塔省贡献了加拿大总就业增长的近四分之一。“December’s numbers are proof that our economy is thriving and resilient thanks to our strong economic and fiscal policies and the actions we are taking to attract investment. In a single month, Alberta has gained more than 41,000 new full-time jobs, and almost 94,000 full-time jobs in 2022. Most of this job growth comes from the private sector, with major gains in construction, manufacturing, transportation and warehousing, technology, business and health care. Over the past year, Alberta has contributed almost a quarter of Canada’s total employment growth.

“我们省有大约 100,000 个职位空缺，我们继续欢迎那些想要体验新的艾伯塔省优势的人。在艾伯塔省，不仅有很多建立事业、家庭和生活的机会，而且我们省还处于能够为最弱势群体提供有针对性的援助的独特地位。艾伯塔省的负担能力措施——例如为最需要的人提供通货膨胀减免，以及为艾伯塔人节省天然气、柴油和电力费用的计划——为艾伯塔人提供广泛的援助，并为最需要帮助的人提供额外帮助。“With around 100,000 job openings in our province, we continue to welcome those who want to experience the renewed Alberta Advantage. Not only are there great opportunities to build careers, families and lives in Alberta, our province is also in the unique position of being able to provide targeted assistance to the most vulnerable. Alberta’s affordability measures – such as inflation relief for those who need it the most, and programs that save Albertans money on gas, diesel and electricity – provide widespread assistance for Albertans, with extra help to those most in need.

“阿尔伯塔省不断增长的经济、卓越的生活质量和负担能力措施使我们省在第三季度的增长中领先全国。几十年来创纪录的国际移民水平和最高的省际净移民表明，来自加拿大和世界各地的人们都将艾伯塔省视为机遇之地。”“Alberta’s growing economy, exceptional quality of life and affordability measures contribute to our province leading the country in third-quarter growth. Record levels of international migration paired with the highest net interprovincial migration in decades show that people from across Canada and around the world are taking notice of Alberta as the land of opportunity.”
