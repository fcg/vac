IRCC 批准 Pearson 英语考试用于加拿大移民申请 PTE 将与雅思和 CELPIP 一起作为技术工人候选人将能够用于其加拿大移民申请的三种英语语言测试之一。	IRCC approves Pearson Test of English for Canadian immigration applications PTE will join IELTS and CELPIP as one of three English-language tests that skilled worker candidates will be able to use for their Canadian immigration applications.
	
IRCC 刚刚宣布已批准用于加拿大移民申请的 Pearson 英语考试。	IRCC has just announced it has approved the Pearson Test of English for Canadian immigration applications.
	
从“2023 年底”开始，培生英语考试 (PTE) 将加入 CELPIP 和雅思考试普通培训，作为技术工人能够完成的三项指定语言测试之一，以向加拿大移民、难民和公民部证明他们的英语语言能力（IRCC）。	Beginning in “late 2023”, the Pearson Test of English (PTE) will join CELPIP and IELTS General Training as one of three designated language tests that skilled workers will be able to complete to demonstrate their English language proficiency to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC).
	
PTE 的批准意味着现在有五种语言测试可供技术工人候选人使用——除了上述三种英语语言测试之外，TEF Canada 和 TCF Canada 是 IRCC 指定的两种法语语言测试。	The approval of PTE means there are now five total language tests available to skilled worker candidates—in addition to the three aforementioned English language tests, the TEF Canada and TCF Canada are the two French language tests designated by IRCC.
	
IRCC 要求所有技术工人候选人完成语言能力测试，以证明他们有能力在加拿大经济发展。加拿大统计局的研究表明，精通英语和/或法语是加拿大经济一体化的有力预测指标。	IRCC requires that all skilled worker candidates complete language proficiency testing to demonstrate their ability to economically establish in Canada. Statistics Canada research shows strong proficiency in English and/or French language proficiency is a strong predictor of economic integration in Canada.
	
IRCC 没有具体说明技术工人候选人何时能够提交 PTE 以支持其加拿大移民申请人，但它在其网站上写道，预计将在 2023 年底前完成。	IRCC has not specified when skilled worker candidates will be able to submit PTE in support of their Canadian immigration applicants, however it has written on its website it anticipates it will be in a position to do so towards the end of 2023.
	
加拿大为经济类移民提供了 100 多种不同的途径。根据 2023-2025 年移民水平计划，主要的录取途径是省提名计划 (PNP) 和快速通道。 IRCC 试点项目、大西洋移民项目和魁北克技术工人项目等其他经济类途径的申请人还必须完成 IRCC 指定的语言测试。	Canada offers over 100 different pathways for economic class immigrants. Under the Immigration Levels Plan 2023-2025, the leading admissions pathways are the Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) and Express Entry. Applicants for other economic class pathways such as IRCC pilot programs, the Atlantic Immigration Program, and Quebec skilled worker programs must also complete a language test designated by IRCC.
	
除了完成 IRCC 指定的语言测试外，候选人还必须达到给定途径的最低加拿大语言基准 (CLB) 分数。例如，根据流行的联邦技术工人计划 (FSWP)，候选人必须在所有四种能力（写作、阅读、听力和口语）中获得至少 7 的 CLB。某些课程所需的最低标准是 CLB 4。	In addition to completing an IRCC designated language test, candidates must achieve the minimum Canadian Language Benchmark (CLB) score set for a given pathway. For example, under the popular Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP), candidates must obtain a CLB of at least 7 in all four abilities (writing, reading, listening, and speaking). The minimum standard required for certain programs is a CLB 4.
	
对于某些途径，例如通过快速通道管理的途径和由各省和地区运营的兴趣表达系统，候选人获得的分数越高，CLB 分数越高。	For certain pathways, such as those managed via Express Entry and expression of interest systems operated by the provinces and territories, candidates receive more points the higher there CLB score is.
	
2022 年，_CIC News_ 获得了一份 IRCC 内部备忘录，确认该部门已经批准了一项用于加拿大移民目的的新语言测试。该备忘录还概述了该部门正在探索的潜在语言测试改革。	In 2022, _CIC News_ obtained an internal IRCC memo confirming that the department had approved of a new language test for Canadian immigration purposes. The memo also outlined potential language testing reforms the department was exploring.
