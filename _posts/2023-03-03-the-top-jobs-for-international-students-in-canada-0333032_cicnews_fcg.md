在分析了加拿大国际学生可以获得的最佳工作的知名来源（IDP、CTV、ApplyBoard）后，CIC News 编制了以下列表——考虑到灵活的工作时间、公平的薪酬、沉浸在一个领域和随和的工作职责.	After analyzing reputable sources (IDP, CTV, ApplyBoard) on top jobs available to international students in Canada, CIC News has compiled the following list—with consideration to flexible work hours, fair pay, immersion in a field, and easy-going work responsibilities.
	
### 热门兼职工作	Top part-time jobs
	
- 助教 (TA)——平均工资：23 加元/小时	-   Teaching Assistants (TA)—Average pay: $23 CAD/hour
	
这是最容易获得的角色之一，因为大多数助教职位都是为学生保留的。助教工作是有利的，因为它们可以让学生沉浸在他们的研究领域并获得教学经验——对于那些追求学术事业的人来说尤其有价值。这也可能是与特定教授或教职员工密切合作的绝佳机会，同时能够赚钱和养活自己。助教工作很方便，因为它们通常发生在大学/学院校园内，可以节省学生的通勤时间和旅行费用。	This is one of the simplest roles to acquire, as most TA positions are reserved for students. TA jobs are advantageous because they allow students to immerse themselves in their field of study and get teaching experience—especially valuable for those pursuing a career in academia. This can also be an excellent chance to work closely with a specific professor or faculty, while being able to earn and support oneself. TA jobs are convenient as they typically occur on university/college campuses, saving students commuting time and travel costs.
	
- 服务器/调酒师/调酒师——平均工资：16 加元/小时 + 小费	-   Server/Bartender/Mixologist—Average pay: $16 CAD/hour + tips
	
对于这个年龄段的国际学生，服务/调酒在选择工作时间方面具有很大的灵活性，同时由于小费而提供了显着的收入增长（取决于工作时间和工作场所的受欢迎程度）。加拿大的标准税前小费率在 15-18% 之间，这意味着每周工作多个小时的学生仅靠小费就可以多赚 200-400 美元，而且许多人报告的更多。	For international students of age, serving/bartending allows for a great deal of flexibility in choosing work hours, while providing a serious earnings boost (depending on hours worked and popularity of workplace) because of tips. Standard pre-tax tipping rates in Canada are between 15-18%, meaning that students working multiple hours a week can earn as much as $200-400 extra in just tips alone, with many reporting more.
	
- 拼车司机——平均工资：[19 加元/小时](https://ca.indeed.com/career/driver-(independent-contractor)/salaries?from=top_sb)	-   Ride-share Driver—Average pay: [$19 CAD/hour](https://ca.indeed.com/career/driver-(independent-contractor)/salaries?from=top_sb)
	
Uber 和 Lyft 等拼车应用程序在学生热点地区（多伦多、温哥华、蒙特利尔等）非常受欢迎。要符合资格，学生必须至少年满 21 岁，拥有有效的驾驶执照、可靠的汽车和智能手机。这项工作独特地为学生提供了设置工作时间的完全自由；在他们的日程安排允许的范围内尽可能多或少地工作。	Ride-sharing applications like Uber and Lyft are very popular in student hotspots (Toronto, Vancouver, Montreal, etc.). To be eligible, students must be at least 21 years of age, have a valid driver’s license, a dependable car, and a smartphone. The job uniquely provides students complete freedom to set their work hours; working as much or as little as their schedule permits.
	
注意：收入可能会有很大差异，具体取决于司机驾驶的游乐设施的时间和距离，以及他们在一周内完成的游乐设施数量。	Note: Earnings can vary greatly depending on the time and distance of the rides that drivers drive, and how many rides they clear in a week.
	
- 导师——平均工资：30 加元/小时	-   Tutor—Average pay: $30 CAD/hour
	
与助教职位一样，辅导是学生在学习期间赚钱的另一种好方法。辅导允许学生设定自己的价格、职责和工作时间。这也可以让学生沉浸在一个专注于教学的研究领域，而不必担心行政工作。	Like TA positions, tutoring can be another great way for students to earn money during their studies. Tutoring allows students to set their own prices, duties, and hours of work. This can also enable students to immerse themselves in a field of study with a specific focus on teaching, while not having to worry about administrative work.
	
- 自由职业者——平均工资：23 加元/小时	-   Freelancer—Average pay: $23 CAD/hour
	
作为一个涵盖广泛职业的广泛工作类别，作为一名自由职业者可以为学生带来大量机会——工作时间的灵活性和决定工作率的独立性。自由职业也是一个在感兴趣的行业/职业中树立名声和工作的好机会。虽然这项工作可能很艰难，因为学生最初要建立自己并吸引更多客户，但自由职业为那些有足够动力在学习期间追求这条道路的人提供了许多专业途径。	A broad job category that encompasses a wide range of occupations, being a freelancer can yield a wealth of opportunities for students—with flexibility of work hours and independence to decide work rates. Freelancing is also a great opportunity to establish one’s name and work in an industry/profession of interest. While this work can be tough as students initially establish themselves and entice more customers, freelance work provides a number of professional avenues for those motivated enough to pursue this path during their studies.

###谨记	Keep in mind
	
在国际学生完成学业的过程中，应密切关注三个关键因素：薪酬、工作条件和移民注意事项。	As international students work through their studies, there are three key factors, that should be paid close attention to: pay, working conditions, and immigration considerations.
	
2022年4月1日，加拿大投票通过了一项新的联邦最低工资政策，将全国最低工资提高到15.55加元/小时，并承诺根据通货膨胀进行调整。国际学生应确保（除了特定的就业安排，如 Co-op 职位）他们的工资至少与这个数字相称。	On April 1, 2022, Canada voted to implement a new federal minimum wage policy, raising the nation-wide minimum wage to $15.55 CAD/hour, with the promise of adjustments based on inflation. International students should ensure (outside of specific employment arrangements like Co-op positions) that their wages are at least commensurate with this number.
	
此外，国际学生应该意识到，作为加拿大的临时外国工人，他们享有与加拿大永久居民和公民相同的所有工人权利。如果国际学生发现他们的雇主侵犯了他们工人的任何权利，他们有权依法向有关当局举报。	Additionally, international students should be aware that as temporary foreign workers in Canada, they are afforded all the same workers’ rights as Canadian permanent residents and citizens. Should an international student find that their employers are in violation of any of their worker’s rights, they are empowered by law to report them to the appropriate authorities.
	
国际学生还应牢记他们必须满足的条件，才有资格获得研究生工作许可 (PGWP)，以便进一步工作并有可能移民到加拿大。即，国际学生必须在学习期间保持全日制身份。这是获得 PGWP 最重要的条件之一，现在国际学生可以在学期期间全职工作，因此应该认真遵守。如果国际毕业生在学习许可到期前申请 PGWP，他们将有资格在维持状态下继续全职工作，甚至在他们的申请收到决定之前。	International students should also keep in mind conditions that they must meet, to be eligible for a Post Graduate Work Permit (PGWP)—to further work and potentially immigrate to Canada. Namely, international students must maintain full-time status for the duration of their studies. This is one of the most important conditions to receiving a PGWP and should be carefully adhered to now that international students are able to work full time hours during school semesters. If international graduates apply for a PGWP before the expiration of their study permit, they will be eligible to continue working full time under maintained status, even before a decision is received on their application.
	
最后，国际学生应该注意，任何毕业前完成的工作（作为全日制学生）不计入移民资格（大多数流需要至少一年的全职工作经验）。这使得 PGWP 对于希望在加拿大永久定居的学生来说非常重要。	Lastly, international students should note that anyone work done pre-graduation (as a full-time student) does not count towards immigration eligibility (with most streams requiring at least a year’s worth of full-time work experience). This makes the PGWP so crucial for students hoping to settle permanently in Canada.
