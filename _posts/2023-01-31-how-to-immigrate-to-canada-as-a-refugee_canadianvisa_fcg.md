u200d如果您是来自乌克兰、叙利亚或其他正在寻找安全新家的国家的难民，加拿大是一个绝佳的选择。加拿大拥有强大的经济、世界一流的教育体系和慷慨的难民政策，是难民定居和开始新生活的绝佳之地。最重要的是，加拿大以其对移民和难民的多元化、热情好客的文化而闻名。	‍Canada is an excellent option if you're a refugee from Ukraine, Syria, or another country looking for a safe new home. With its strong economy, world-class education system, and generous refugee policies, Canada is an excellent place for refugees to settle and build a new life. On top of this, Canada is famous for its diverse, warm and welcoming culture toward immigrants and refugees alike.
	
加拿大安置难民的历史可以追溯到 1776 年，加拿大政府在 2022 年 1 月至 2022 年 12 月期间接收了 92,715 名难民。因此，加拿大不仅是您抵达加拿大土地后将获得的诸多好处的完美选择，但与标准相似的国家相比，在加拿大获得难民身份要容易得多。	Canada has a history of settling refugees dating back to 1776, and the Canadian government accepted 92,715 refugees between January and December 2022. As a result, not only is Canada a perfect option for the many benefits you will obtain once you arrive on Canadian soil, but it can be far easier to qualify for refugee status in Canada compared to nations of a similar standard.
	
本文将提供有关如何作为难民移居加拿大的分步指南。我们将介绍加拿大的难民制度、各种难民赞助计划、该国的入境，以及如何申请难民身份、获得医疗保健、找工作和接受教育。我们还将分享一些技巧和策略，以确保顺利过渡到加拿大的生活。	This article will provide a step-by-step guide on how to move to Canada as a refugee. We'll cover the refugee system in Canada, the various refugee sponsorship programs, the country's entry, and how to apply for refugee status, access healthcare, find employment, and get an education. We'll also share some tips and strategies to ensure a smooth transition to life in Canada.
	
加拿大的难民制度	The Refugee System in Canada
	
!加拿大的难民制度	!Canada's Refugee System  
	
加拿大在欢迎难民方面有着悠久的历史，并建立了官方难民系统来帮助那些寻求安全新家的人。加拿大难民制度基于国际法和国内法，以及加拿大保护那些逃离本国暴力和迫害的人的人道主义承诺。	Canada has a long history of welcoming refugees and has established an official refugee system to help those seeking a safe new home. The Canadian refugee system is based on international and domestic laws, as well as Canada's humanitarian commitment to protect those who are fleeing violence and persecution in their home countries.
	
根据加拿大难民制度，难民可以直接向政府或通过私人担保人在加拿大申请庇护。加拿大政府也有多项计划来帮助难民安顿下来并融入他们的新家园。	Under the Canadian refugee system, refugees can apply for asylum in Canada either directly to the government or through a private sponsor. Canada's government also has several programs to help refugees settle and integrate into their new homes.
	
如果您以难民身份来到加拿大，您可以凭工作许可证在加拿大工作。如果您在申请工作许可之前提交了难民申请，则可以单独申请。	If you've come to Canada as a refugee, you're allowed to work in Canada with a Work permit. You could apply separately if you submitted your refugee claim before applying for a work permit.
	
以下是如何申请加拿大工作许可的完整细目。但是，要以难民身份申请工作许可，您必须采取一些额外的步骤。	Here's a full breakdown of how to apply for a Canadian work permit. However, to apply for a work permit as a refugee, there are a few extra steps you must take.
	
在上传您的文件作为申请的一部分时，您必须附上一份您的难民保护申请人文件副本和证明：	When uploading your documentation as part of your application, you must include a copy of your Refugee Protection Claimant document and proof that:
	
* 您已经完成移民体检	  You’ve completed your immigration medical exam
* 您需要在加拿大找到一份工作来满足您的基本需求	  You need a job in Canada to cover your basic needs
* 您为其申请许可的家庭成员是：	  The family members you're requesting permits for are:
	
*   在加拿大	  In Canada
* 申请难民身份	  Applying for Refugee status
	
您必须确保加拿大政府始终掌握您当前的地址以避免延误。	You must ensure the Canadian government always has your current address to avoid delays.
	
最重要的是，作为难民，只要您获得加拿大学习许可，您就可以在加拿大学习。要获得学习许可，您必须在申请前获得指定学习机构 (DLI) 的录取通知书。	On top of this, as a refugee, you can study while in Canada, provided you get a Canadian study permit. To obtain a study permit, you must have an acceptance letter from a Designated Learning Institution (DLI) before you apply.
	
以下是加拿大学习许可、资格要求以及如何开始申请的完整细目。	Here's a full breakdown of the Canadian study permit, eligibility requirements, and how to apply to get you started.
	
如果您有录取通知书，您可以在申请难民身份的同时申请学习许可。您还可以在申请难民身份时附上您的录取通知书，以最大限度地提高您被录取的机会。	If you have an acceptance letter, you can apply for a study permit while you apply for refugee status. You can also include your acceptance letter with your application for refugee status to maximize your chances of being accepted.
	
如果您的家人申请难民身份，他们就有资格获得加拿大学习许可。但是，如果您的成员是学龄儿童，他们上学不需要学习许可。	Your family members can qualify for Canadian study permits if they apply for refugee status. However, if your members are school-age children, they don't need a study permit to go to school.
	
加拿大难民保护计划	Canadian Refugee Protection Programs
	
加拿大难民系统有两个主要部分。第一个是难民和人道主义重新安置计划，该计划专门为联合国或私人资助的赞助商设计，以帮助在加拿大重新安置国际难民。	The Canadian refugee system has two main parts. The first is the Refugee and Humanitarian Resettlement Program which is explicitly designed for UN- or privately-funded sponsors to help resettle international refugees in Canada.
	
第二个是加拿大境内庇护计划，该计划专门为已经在加拿大并持有加拿大旅游签证等签证但由于安全问题无法返回本国的难民设计。	The second is the In-Canada Asylum Program, which s explicitly designed for refugees who are already in Canada on a visa like a Canada tourist visa but are unable to return to their country due to issues of safety.
	
### 难民和人道主义安置计划	The Refugee and Humanitarian Resettlement Program
	
除了政府的难民系统外，还有一些私人赞助计划可供从加拿大境外申请并希望移居加拿大的难民使用。该计划旨在帮助难民找到住房、就业和其他服务，帮助他们在新家安顿下来。	In addition to the government's refugee system, several private sponsorship programs are available to refugees applying from outside Canada who wish to move to Canada. This program is designed to help refugees find housing, employment, and other services to help them get settled in their new homes.
	
加拿大的许多难民都是通过私人赞助计划重新安置的。这些项目通常由公民个人、教堂、社区组织和其他团体组织，为难民提供经济和情感支持，帮助他们适应新家园。	Many refugees in Canada are resettled via private sponsorship programs. These programs are usually organized by private citizens, churches, community organizations, and other groups to provide financial and emotional support to refugees to help them adjust to their new homes.
	
这些赞助商与联合国难民署 (UNHCR) 确定的难民和混合签证办公室推荐 (BVOR) 计划的私人赞助商相匹配。难民可以由几个不同的赞助商赞助，例如：	These sponsors are matched to refugees identified by the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) and private sponsors by the Blended Visa Office-Referred (BVOR) Program. The refugees can be sponsored by several different sponsors, such as:
	
*赞助协议持有人	  Sponsorship Agreement Holders
	
* 这些通常是私人公民或团体，他们与加拿大政府签署了赞助协议，被允许支持难民，通常是持续的。	  These are often private citizens or groups who have signed sponsorship agreements with the Government of Canada to be allowed to support refugees, often on an ongoing basis.
	
* 五人一组	  Groups of Five
* 这是一个由至少五名加拿大公民或永久居民组成的团体，他们可以资助来自加拿大境外的难民移居加拿大。	    *   This is a group of at least five Canadian citizens or permanent residents who can sponsor a refugee from outside Canada to move to Canada.
* 社区赞助商	  Community Sponsors
	
* 社区组织被指定赞助难民来到加拿大。	  Community organizations are designated to sponsor refugees to come to Canada.
	
加拿大政府仔细筛选所有重新安置案例，以确保没有安全、法律或健康问题。	The Canadian government carefully screens all resettlement cases to ensure no security, legal, or health issues.
	
通过此计划移居加拿大意味着您不能直接向加拿大政府网站申请。您必须向联合国难民署、指定的推荐组织或私人赞助团体提出申请。	Moving to Canada via this program means you cannot apply directly to the Canadian government site. You must apply to the UNHCR, a designated referral organization or a private sponsorship group.
	
### 加拿大境内庇护计划	In-Canada Asylum Program
	
庇护计划致力于为因在本国面临酷刑或残忍或不寻常惩罚的风险而无法返回本国的加拿大人提供难民保护，这些因素包括：	The asylum program works to provide refugee protection to people in Canada who cannot return to their home country due to at risk of torture or cruel or unusual punishment in their home countries based on factors like
	
*   种族	  Race
*   宗教	  Religion
* 政治观点	  Political opinion
*   国籍	  Nationality
* 属于特定社会群体，例如女性或 LGBTQ+ 社区	  Belonging to a particular social group, such as women or the LGBTQ+ community
	
这意味着他们有充分理由担心回国后会受到迫害。	This means they have a well-founded fear of persecution upon their return.
	
但是，此选项仅对某些人开放。如果寻求庇护者过去曾被判犯有严重的刑事罪行或之前的难民申请被拒绝，他们将没有资格参加该计划。虽然这些是申请人可能被该计划拒绝的两个主要原因，但如果出现以下情况，他们也将被解雇：	However, this option is only open to certain people. If an asylum seeker has been convicted of serious criminal offences in the past or has had previous refugee claims denied, they will be ineligible for this program. While these are the main two reasons applicants may be rejected from this program, they will also be dismissed if:
	
如果您符合以下条件，您的难民申请可能不符合该计划的资格：	Your refugee claim may not be eligible for this program if you:
	
* 在您可以返回的另一个国家获得公约难民身份	  Have gained Convention refugee status in another country that you can return to
* 在加拿大有受保护的人身份	  Have protected person status in Canada
* 通过加拿大-美国边境	  Passed through the Canada-United States border
* 已在另一个国家提出确认的难民申请	  Have made a confirmed refugee claim in another country
* 不允许进入加拿大	  Are inadmissible to Canada
* 放弃或退出过去的难民申请	  Have abandoned or withdrew from a past refugee claim
	
如何在加拿大申请难民身份	How to Apply for Refugee Status in Canada
	
!如何申请加拿大难民身份	!How to Apply for Canadian Refugee Status  
	
难民身份的过程很简单，可以分为三个简单的步骤。	The process for refugee status is straightforward and can be broken down into three simple steps.
	
### 第 1 步：确保您的资格	Step 1: Ensure Your Eligibility
	
在开始申请流程之前，您必须确保满足上述所有资格标准。假设您仍在确定是否满足所有要求。在这种情况下，您应该从经过认证的移民专家那里获得完整的在线或离线评估，以帮助您了解您是否符合某些条件。	Before you begin the application process, you must ensure you fulfill all the eligibility criteria mentioned above. Suppose you are still determining whether or not you fulfill all of the requirements. In that case, you should get a complete online or offline evaluation from a certified immigration expert to help you know your eligibility for certain.
	
### 第 2 步：填写您的申请表	Step 2: Fill Out Your Application Forms
	
首先，您必须填写加拿大政府网站上或您申请难民身份的特定组织提供的申请表。您必须提供有关您在加拿大寻求避难的身份、背景和原因的详细信息。	First, you must fill out an application form available on the Government of Canada website or from the specific organization through which you are applying for refugee status. You must provide detailed information about your identity, background, and reasons for seeking refuge in Canada.
	
### 第 3 步：提交您的申请	Step 3: Submit Your Application
	
一旦您的申请完成，您必须将其提交给加拿大的难民处理中心之一。处理中心将审查您的申请并决定是否授予您难民身份。	Once your application is complete, you must submit it to one of Canada's Refugee Processing Centres. The processing centre will review your application and decide whether or not to grant you refugee status.
	
虽然此过程看似简单，但确保您满足所有资格要求并遵循每个流程步骤可能具有挑战性。由于时间紧迫，保证您的难民身份的最佳方法之一是从经过认证的移民专家那里获得帮助，例如受监管的加拿大移民顾问 (RCIC)。	While this process may seem simple, ensuring you fulfill all of the eligibility requirements and follow each process step can be challenging. As time is of the essence, one of the best ways to guarantee your refugee status is to get help from a certified immigration expert like a Regulated Canadian Immigration Consultant (RCIC).
	
RCIC 可以对您进行评估以确保您符合所选项目的资格，填写您的申请表并帮助您与任何监管机构打交道，这样您就可以在加拿大开始您的生活。	RCICs can evaluate you to ensure you're eligible for your chosen program, fill out your application forms and help you deal with any regulatory bodies so you can get your start in Canada.

如果私人团体或组织赞助您，您可能还有资格获得额外的医疗保险，例如延长的健康福利。	If a private group or organization sponsors you, you may also be eligible for additional healthcare coverage, such as extended health benefits.
	
请务必注意，难民的医疗保险范围有限，可能无法支付所有医疗费用。因此，制定计划来支付任何额外的医疗费用至关重要。	It's important to note that healthcare coverage for refugees is limited and may not cover all medical costs. Therefore, it's crucial to have a plan in place to cover any additional medical expenses.
