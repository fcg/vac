从美国永久移居加拿大：以工作为基础的方法 美国居民可以受益于在加拿大获得永久居留权的途径，这条途径比许多其他国家的外国人更容易获得。在下面探索基于工作的加拿大永久居留权方法。	Moving to Canada permanently from the U.S: A work-based approach U.S. residents can benefit from a path to PR in Canada that is easier to obtain than foreign nationals from many other countries. Explore the work-based approach to Canadian permanent residency below.
	
美国公民和居民可以通过多种移民途径获得加拿大永久居留权。	U.S. citizens and residents have many immigration pathways available to them that lead to Canadian Permanent Residency.
	
在很大程度上由于地理上的接近和工作文化的相似性，美国居民在加拿大成功找到了工作机会。许多移民候选人利用他们在加拿大的工作经验获得了加拿大的永久居留权。	Due in large part to geographic proximity and similarities in work cultures, U.S. residents have had success in finding job opportunities in Canada. Many immigration candidates have leveraged their Canadian work experience to gain permanent residence in Canada.
	
### 快速通道	Express Entry
	
Express Entry 是加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 使用的在线申请管理系统，用于管理来自三个不同项目的技术工人申请——加拿大经验类 (CEC)、联邦技术工人计划 (FSWP) 和联邦技术贸易计划 (FSTP)。	Express Entry is the online application management system used by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) to manage the intake of skilled worker applications from three different programs — the Canadian Experience Class (CEC), the Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP), and the Federal Skilled Trades Program (FSTP).
	
该应用程序管理系统使用综合排名系统 (CRS) 对候选人进行评分，该系统依赖于多种因素，包括年龄、教育、英语或法语语言能力、在加拿大的家庭关系以及加拿大工作经验。 CRS 分数最高的申请人大约每两周抽签一次，并收到申请加拿大永久居留权 (PR) 的邀请 (ITA)。	This application management system scores candidates using the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS), which relies on a variety of factors, from age, education, English or French language proficiency, family connections in Canada, and Canadian work experience. Applicants with the highest CRS scores are drawn roughly every two weeks and receive an Invitation to Apply (ITA) for Canadian Permanent Residence (PR).
	
### 加拿大工作经验提升Express Entry竞争力	Canadian work experience boosts Express Entry competitiveness
	
在加拿大工作的美国居民可以在快速通道池中拥有显着优势，增加他们获得 PR 的可能性。	U.S. residents who work in Canada can have a significant advantage in the Express Entry pool, increasing their likelihood of receiving PR.
	
为了证明加拿大工作经验对“快速通道”个人资料的影响，我们将研究 Rohit 的虚构个人资料，他在被一家总部位于温哥华的软件公司根据全球人才流 (GTS) 从芝加哥招聘后在加拿大工作。	To demonstrate the effect of Canadian work experience on an Express Entry profile, we will examine the fictional profile of Rohit who is working in Canada after being recruited from Chicago by a Vancouver-based software company under the Global Talent Stream (GTS).
	
简而言之，GTS 是一项快速通道计划，加拿大雇主可以利用该计划将外国人才带到这个国家，并允许他们利用自己的技能来帮助创新的加拿大公司成长。	Briefly, the GTS is a fast-tracked program that Canadian employers can use to bring foreign talent to this country and allow them to utilize their skills in the service of helping innovative Canadian companies grow.
	
作为加拿大更大的全球人才战略的一部分并包含在临时外国工人计划 (TFWP) 中，GTS 加快了工作许可申请和临时居民签证（如果适用）的处理，以便合格的申请人可以在大约两周内开始工作的提交。	Part of Canada’s larger Global Talent Strategy and contained within the Temporary Foreign Worker Program (TFWP), the GTS expedites the processing of work permit applications and temporary resident visas (if applicable) so that qualified applicants can start working in around two weeks from the date of submission.
	
### 认识罗希特	Meet Rohit
	
Rohit 是来自芝加哥的 38 岁单身软件工程师。他没有作为公民或 PR 居住在加拿大的兄弟姐妹，也没有 PNP 录取通知书或资格证书，但他有 TEER 1 职业的有效劳动力市场影响评估支持 (LMIA) 工作邀请。在美国完成学士学位和硕士学位后，他正在加拿大寻求永久居留权，这两个学位他都通过教育证书评估 (ECA) 进行了评估。他没有在加拿大接受过任何教育。	Rohit is a single, 38-year-old software engineer from Chicago. He does not have a sibling living in Canada as a citizen or PR nor a PNP offer or certificate of qualification, but he has a valid Labour Market Impact Assessment\-supported (LMIA) job offer in a TEER 1 occupation. He is seeking PR in Canada after completing a bachelor’s degree and a masters in the U.S., both of which he has had evaluated with an Educational Credential Assessment (ECA). He has not obtained any education in Canada.
	
在伊利诺伊州待了一段时间后，罗希特希望永久居住在加拿大。他听说过很多关于加拿大的好消息，并相信这是他在不久的将来想要定居的地方。他目前没有一整年的加拿大工作经验。 Rohit 的 **CRS 分数为 475**，低于最近的 CRS 截止分数。	Rohit wants to live in Canada permanently after spending some time in Illinois. He’s heard a lot of nice things about Canada and believes it is where he would want to settle down in the near future. He does not currently have a full year of Canadian work experience. Rohit has a **CRS score of 475**, below recent CRS cut-off scores.
	
Rohit 对自己通过快速通道获得 PR 的机会还没有信心，因此他在温哥华完成了他的任期，并尝试在以后再次申请快速通道。 Rohit 在温哥华办公室工作了两年，获得了 GTS 工作许可，然后返回芝加哥并凭借他在加拿大的新工作经验重新申请快速通道。现在，Rohit 注意到他的 CRS 分数已经上升到 **528 CRS 分**。这高于最近的 Express Entry 抽签截止分数。如果 Rohit 在最新的 Express Entry 抽签之前获得了加拿大的工作经验，他就会被选中并获得 ITA。	Not yet confident in his chances to acquire PR through Express Entry, Rohit finish out his tenure in Vancouver and try applying for Express Entry again at a later date. Rohit spends two years at the Vancouver office on a GTS work permit before returning to Chicago and reapplying for Express Entry with his new Canadian work experience. Now, Rohit notices that his CRS score has risen to **528 CRS points**. This is above recent cut-off scores for Express Entry draws. Had Rohit gotten Canadian work experience before the latest Express Entry draw, he would have been selected and received an ITA.
