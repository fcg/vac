加拿大将申请两项看护移民试点项目所需的工作经验减半。	Canada has halved the amount of work experience required to apply for two caregiver immigration pilot programs.
	
2 月 10 日，移民部长肖恩·弗雷泽 (Sean Fraser) 的代表宣布，看护人有资格获得永久居留权所需的加拿大工作经验从 24 个月减少到 12 个月。	On February 10, representatives of Immigration Minister Sean Fraser announced that the amount of work experience in Canada required for a caregiver to qualify for permanent residence is being reduced from 24 months to 12 months.
	
此外，已经为那些已经从以前的工作许可获得加拿大工作经验的人预留了一些现有护理人员试点的空间。这意味着，从以前的工作许可中获得合格工作经验的看护人可以申请永久居留权。	Also, some spaces for the existing caregiver pilots have been set aside for those who already have work experience in Canada from a previous work permit. Meaning, caregivers who have eligible work experience from a previous work permit can apply for permanent residence.
	
该变化将于 2023 年 4 月 30 日生效。它对已经申请的人具有追溯力，这意味着您不必等到 4 月底才能受益。	The change is going into effect on April 30, 2023. It will be retroactive for people who have already applied, meaning you do not have to wait till the end of April to benefit.
	
新的资格标准适用于来自家庭儿童保育提供者 (HCCP) 试点和家庭支持工作者 (HSW) 试点的申请人。它包括已经申请的人，以及打算申请剩余试点的人。	The new eligibility criteria applies to applicants from both the Home Child Care Provider (HCCP) pilot and the Home Support Worker (HSW) pilot. It includes people who have already applied, and those who intend to apply for the remainder of the pilots.
	
加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 预计放宽的要求将使目前正在处理的大约 90% 的申请受益。	Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) expects the eased requirement will benefit around 90% of applications currently in processing.
	
试点项目目前定于 2024 年 6 月结束，届时它们可能会停止或成为永久性项目。	The pilots are currently slated to conclude in June 2024, at which time they could be discontinued or be made into a permanent program.
	
IRCC 的一份媒体新闻稿称：“有关看护人计划未来的工作正在进行中，以规划 2024 年 6 月试点结束后的下一步。”	“Work is underway on the future of caregiver programming to plan for what comes next after the pilots conclude in June 2024,” an IRCC media release says.
	
IRCC 还表示，看护人及其家人将受益于更快获得加拿大永久居留权的途径。通过减少在加拿大所需的工作经验数量，IRCC 打算改进处理和申请。	IRCC also says caregivers and their families will benefit from a faster path to Canadian permanent residence. By reducing the amount of work experience required in Canada, IRCC intends to improve processing and applications.
	
自2019年试点启动以来，已有近1600名看护者及其家属成为永久居民——仅2022年就有1100名看护者及其家属获得PR。	Since the pilots launched in 2019, nearly 1,600 caregivers and their family members have become permanent residents—1,100 caregivers and their family members got PR in 2022 alone.
	
“看护人是加拿大家庭的一个重要选择，在许多成长中的孩子、年迈的父母和那些需要额外专业护理的人的生活中发挥了重要作用，”引用移民部长肖恩·弗雷泽 (Sean Fraser) 的一句话说道。 “通过将在加拿大所需的工作经验减少到一年，更多的看护人和他们的家人将有资格更快地过渡到永久居留权，这意味着他们可以在加拿大安顿下来并开始他们生活的下一章。”	“Caregivers are an important option for families in Canada and have played an instrumental role in the lives of many growing children, aging parents, and those who need additional specialized care,” reads a quote attributed to Immigration Minister Sean Fraser. “By reducing the work experience required in Canada to one year, more caregivers and their families will become eligible to transition to permanent residence sooner, meaning that they can settle down and start the next chapter of their lives here in Canada.”
	
移民约占加拿大人口增长的 75%。大多数加拿大移民来自经济类别。到 2036 年，移民可能占加拿大人口的 30%，而 2011 年这一比例为 20.7%。	Immigration accounts for roughly 75 percent of Canada’s population growth. Most immigrants to Canada come through the economic category. By 2036, immigrants could represent up to 30 percent of Canada’s population, compared with 20.7 percent in 2011.
	
五十年前，在加拿大，每个退休人员对应七名工人。这个数字现在接近三个，如果加拿大保持目前的轨迹，在未来 10 到 15 年内，这个比例可能会下降到两个。	Fifty years ago, there were seven workers for every retiree in Canada. That number is now closer to three, and if Canada stays on its current trajectory, in the next 10 to 15 years, that ratio could drop to two.
	
到 2023 年，加拿大预计将接纳 465,000 名新永久居民，主要通过经济移民计划。	In 2023, Canada is expecting to admit 465,000 new permanent residents, mostly through economic immigration programs.
