# 电视和电影工作者如何在加拿大工作？如果电视和电影制作人员符合其所参与制作的必要人员资格，则他们可以从国外来加拿大工作。	How can TV and Film workers work in Canada? TV and Film production workers can come from abroad to work in Canada if they qualify as essential personnel for the production that they are involved in.
加拿大曾制作过一些世界上最受欢迎的电影和电视节目。	Canada has played host to productions for some of the world’s all-time most popular movies and TV shows.
	
多年来，1997 年的《泰坦尼克号》（新斯科舍省）、2005 年的《断背山》（阿尔伯塔省）和 2008 年的《暮光之城》（不列颠哥伦比亚省）的部分场景在这个国家的不同地区拍摄。最重要的是，在电视界，加拿大一直是《闪电侠》（温哥华）和法律剧《金装律师》（多伦多）等热门节目的制作地——后者由多伦多本地人帕特里克·J·亚当斯主演。	Parts of 1997’s Titanic (Nova Scotia), 2005’s Brokeback Mountain (Alberta) and 2008’s Twilight (British Columbia) were filmed across different parts of this country over the years.

Adams.
