加拿大在“快速通道”历史上首次举行仅针对联邦技术工人的抽签 IRCC 已向联邦技术工人计划的候选人发出了 3,300 份邀请。	Canada holds first Federal Skilled Workers-only draw in Express Entry history IRCC has issued 3,300 invitations to candidates in the Federal Skilled Worker Program.
	
IRCC 今天举行了 2023 年第四次快速通道抽签。	IRCC held the fourth Express Entry draw of 2023 today.
	
加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 向 3,300 名最低综合排名系统 (CRS) 分数为 489 的候选人发出了邀请。抽签仅适用于联邦技术工人计划的候选人，这是自 2015 年快速通道开始以来的第一次. 这是继 2 月 1 日的结果之后，2023 年的第二次特定项目抽签，只有已经获得省提名的候选人才能获得 ITA。	Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) issued invitations to 3,300 candidates with a minimum Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) score of 489. The draw was only applicable to candidates in the Federal Skilled Worker Program for the first time since Express Entry began in 2015. This was the second program-specific draw of 2023 following the results on February 1 in which only candidates who had already received provincial nomination obtained an ITA.
	
### 2023 年快速通道	Express Entry in 2023
	
通常，快速通道抽签每两周在周三举行。然而，2023 年的抽签偏离了自 2015 年快速通道成立以来的惯例。	Typically, Express Entry draws take place every two weeks on Wednesdays. However, draws in 2023 have deviated from the routine seen since Express Entry was established in 2015.
	
今年的第一次抽签发生在 11 月 23 日抽签意外暂停六周之后。IRCC 在给_CIC News_ 的电子邮件中暗示暂停是由于实施 NOC 导致的 IT 系统故障2021.	The first draw this year, on January 11, occurred after an unexpected six-week pause following the draw on November 23. IRCC has implied in an email to _CIC News_ that the pause was due to an IT system glitch caused by the implementation of NOC 2021.
	
1 月 11 日邀请了 5,500 名候选人，最低 CRS 分数为 507。这是自 2020 年 12 月至 7 月大流行中断 18 个月后恢复所有项目抽签以来，候选人人数最多，CRS 截止分数最低的一次2022.	There were 5,500 candidates invited on January 11 with minimum CRS scores of 507. It was the highest number of candidates, with the lowest CRS cut-off score, since all-program draws resumed after an 18-month pandemic hiatus between December 2020 and July 2022.
	
1 月 18 日的下一周又进行了一次抽签，邀请了相同数量的候选人，但最低 CRS 分数低得多，为 490。这次抽签令人惊讶，因为 IRCC 通常不会连续几周向候选人发出 ITA。	There was another draw the following week on January 18 that invited the same number of candidates but with a much lower minimum CRS score of 490. This draw came as a surprise as IRCC does not usually issue ITAs to candidates in consecutive weeks.
	
### IRCC 仅对 PNP 候选人进行快速通道抽签	IRCC holds Express Entry draw for PNP candidates only
	
最近，2 月 1 日的抽签在预计暂停两周后举行，但这是自 2022 年 6 月以来的第一次抽签，只邀请获得省提名的快速通道候选人。甚至在大流行之前，IRCC 就特定项目举行抽签是不寻常的。除了联邦技术贸易计划的少数例外，几乎所有快速通道抽签都是全项目抽签。	Most recently, the February 1 draw took place after an expected two-week pause but was the first draw since June 2022 that invited only Express Entry candidates who had received a provincial nomination. It is unusual for IRCC to hold program-specific draws, even before the pandemic. With a few exceptions for the Federal Skilled Trades Program, nearly all Express Entry draws have been all-program draws.
	
自从 COVID-19 大流行期间所有项目的抽签暂停以来，IRCC 就没有举行过仅限 PNP 的快速通道抽签。在暂停期间，Express Entry 抽签继续对 Express Entry 池中已经获得省提名的候选人进行抽签。	IRCC has not held a PNP only Express Entry draw since the all-program draw pause during the COVID-19 pandemic. During the pause, Express Entry draws continued for candidates in the Express Entry pool who had already received provincial nomination.
	
由省提名的候选人在其快速入境申请中自动获得额外的 600 CRS 积分。	Candidates nominated by a province automatically receive an additional 600 CRS points on their Express Entry application.
	
### 接下来会发生什么	What to expect next
	
在 C-19 法案获得皇室批准后，快速通道今年可能会发生变化。新法律赋予移民部长邀请候选人满足加拿大经济优先事项并填补劳动力紧迫缺口的权力。预计 IRCC 将开始举行针对特定属性的抽签，而不是仅根据 CRS 分数发布 ITA。	Express Entry is likely to change this year following the royal assent of Bill C-19. The new law gives the immigration minister the authority to invite candidates to meet Canada’s economic priorities and fill urgent gaps in the labour force. It is expected that IRCC will begin holding draws that target specific attributes rather than issuing ITAs based solely on CRS scores.
	
IRCC 最近完成了关于新的基于属性的类别可能是什么样子的公众咨询。候选人的属性可以包括职业、教育、工作经验或语言能力。该部门表示，新类别将在抽奖前公布。	IRCC recently completed public consultations on what the new attribute-based categories could look like. Candidate attributes could range from occupation, education, work experience or language ability. The department says new categories will be announced before the draws.
	
### 什么是快速通道？	What is Express Entry?
	
Express Entry 是三个加拿大移民计划的申请管理系统：加拿大经验类移民计划 (CEC)、联邦技术工人计划 (FSWP) 和联邦技术贸易计划 (FSTP)。快速通道池中的省提名计划 (PNP) 候选人已经有资格参加其中至少一项计划。	Express Entry is the application management system for three Canadian immigration programs: the Canadian Experience Class (CEC), the Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP) and the Federal Skilled Trades Program (FSTP). Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) candidates in the Express Entry pool are already eligible for at least one of these programs.
	
Express Entry 使用基于积分的系统，即综合排名系统 (CRS)，对候选人的个人资料进行排名。得分最高的候选人会收到申请邀请 (ITA)，然后可以申请永久居留权。	Express Entry uses a points-based system, the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS), to rank candidates’ profiles. The top-scoring candidates receive an Invitation to Apply (ITA) and can then apply for permanent residency.
	
候选人申请后，IRCC 官员会审查申请并决定是否批准。一旦完成并获得批准，候选人现在就是加拿大的永久居民，离成为加拿大公民又近了一步。	After the candidate applies, an IRCC officer reviews the application and decides if they are approved. Once this is complete, if approved, the candidate is now a permanent resident of Canada and one step closer to becoming a Canadian citizen.
