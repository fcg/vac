!如何从多米尼加共和国移民到加拿大	!How to Immigrate to Canada from the Dominican Republic
	
你住在多米尼加共和国吗？你有没有想过移民加拿大？如果您对这两个问题的回答都是肯定的，那么我们就有了您需要的信息来促进您的移民。	Do you live in the Dominican Republic? Have you ever thought about immigrating to Canada? If your answer is yes to both of these questions then we have just the information that you need to facilitate your immigration.
	
为什么移居加拿大？	Why Move To Canada?
		
加拿大是世界上最受欢迎的移民目的地之一。它通过其既得利益稳步上升到这个高位，以吸引最多数量的高技能人才，他们可以为国家的物质和文化发展做出贡献。	Canada is one of the most popular immigration destinations in the world. It has steadily risen to this high position through its vested interest to attract the highest number of highly skilled individuals who can contribute to the material and cultural development of the country.
	
这个国家有能力通过其广阔的地理陆地、自然资源和相对较少的人口来做到这一点，人口密度可以忽略不计。该国还拥有非常宽容的社会文化环境，并以庄严的宪法法律体系为基础。	The country can afford to do this through its vast geographical landmass, natural resources and relatively small population with a negligible population density. The country also possesses a very tolerant socio-cultural environment that is underpinned by an enshrined constitutional legal system.
	
这种宽容反映在近年来日益多样化的加拿大人口结构中。在加拿大的各个角落，没有一种单一文化可以凌驾于其他文化之上，因此无论您在移民加拿大之前来自哪里，您仍然会找到归属感。	This tolerance is reflected in the demographics of the Canadian population which has increasingly grown diverse in recent years. In all corners of the country, there is not a single monoculture that reigns supreme over others and so regardless of where you come from before immigrating to Canada you will still find a place of belonging.
	
这种巨大的社会文化多样性带来了不断增加的物质财富，这已成为吸引许多移民移居加拿大的主要因素。	From this great socio-cultural diversity comes the ever increasing material wealth that has become a staple of the attraction for a lot of immigrants to move Canada.
	
这种财富反映在高生活水平、低犯罪率、极小的不平等、低失业率以及有益的医疗保健、教育和住房津贴上。所有这一切都得到了健全的法律制度的加强，该制度确保所有加拿大公民和永久居民都能公平地利用加拿大社会的所有机会和利益。	This wealth is reflected in the high-standard of living, low-crime rates, minimal inequality, low unemployment and beneficial healthcare, education and housing allowances. All of this is reinforced by a sound legal system that ensures all Canadian citizens and permanent residents have a fair shake on capitalizing on all the opportunities and benefits of Canadian society.

有一个相当大的加勒比社区居住在加拿大。在这些加勒比人社区中，可以找到多米尼加共和党人，他们多年来已成为加勒比移民到加拿大的最主要来源之一。这是一张图表，表示最近从多米尼加共和国到加拿大的移民趋势。	There is a sizable community of Caribbeans who live in Canada. Among these communities of Caribbeans can be found Dominican Republicans who over the years have become one of the most prominent sources of Caribbean immigration to Canada. Here is a graph that is a representation of recent immigration trends to Canada from the Dominican Republic.

### 快速通道系统	Express Entry System
	
Express Entry 系统创建于 2015 年，旨在快速跟踪三个联邦计划，即联邦技术工人计划 (FSWP)、联邦技术贸易计划 (FSTP) 和加拿大经验类计划 (CEC)。这些申请可在短短六个月内得到处理，以满足日益严重的劳动力市场短缺问题。	The Express Entry system was created in 2015 to fast-track the three federal programs which are the Federal Skilled Worker Program(FSWP), Federal Skilled Trades Program (FSTP) and Canadian Experience Class (CEC). These applications are processed in as little as six months to meet growing labor market shortages.
	
要开始您的申请，您需要通过快速通道创建在线个人资料并开始详细说明您的背景。然后将通过综合排名系统 (CRS) 衡量此概况，该标准旨在仅找到最强大、最需要和最具适应性的候选人。然后选择这些得分最高的个人资料，并发出永久居留申请邀请 (ITA)。这种选择在快速通道抽签期间每两周进行一次。	To start your application, you will need to create an online profile through Express Entry and begin detailing your background. This profile will then be measured by the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS), criteria created to find only the strongest, most-needed and most adaptable candidates. These highest-scoring profiles are then chosen and issued with Invitations to Apply (ITA) for permanent residence. This selection happens every two weeks during Express Entry draws.
	
**CRS 标准奖励积分：**	**CRS Criteria Awards Points For:**
	
*   年龄	  Age
* CLB语言能力（英语和法语）	  CLB Language proficiency (English and French)
* 教育水平（加拿大境内外）	  Level of Education (In and outside Canada)
* 工作经验（加拿大境内外）	  Work Experience (In and outside Canada)
* 安排就业	  Arranged employment
* 获得省提名	  Provincial Nomination achieved
* 作为永久居民/公民居住在加拿大的兄弟姐妹	  Siblings living in Canada as permanent residents/citizens
* 您配偶的个人资料（如果已婚）	  Your spouse’s profile (if married)
	
除了快速入境系统和省提名计划外，您还可以通过其他一些方式从多米尼加共和国移民到加拿大。除了上述两种移民加拿大的最常见方法——特别是对于希望在不同国家抓住机会的年轻人来说——是通过加拿大国际体验中心 (IEC) 提供的工作假期签证计划。	Besides the Express Entry System and Provincial Nominee Programs there are a few other means through which you can immigrate to Canada from the Dominican Republic. The most common method of immigrating to Canada besides the two aforementioned-especially for young people looking to seize opportunities in a different country- is through a Working Holiday Visa program offered by International Experience Canada (IEC).
	
要有资格申请打工度假签证计划，您必须来自拥有国际青年流动计划的国家/地区。但是，您可以使用一些公认的组织作为替代资源来为您提供申请资格。	To be eligible to apply for the Working Holiday Visa program you have to be from a country that has an International Youth Mobility program. However, there are recognized organizations that you can use as an alternative recourse to provide you with the eligibility to apply.
	
打工度假签证允许您在加拿大工作和旅行一到两年。工作假期计划中提供的工作机会几乎不需要经验。这一因素使那些可能觉得自己不具备移民加拿大的必要资格标准的多米尼加人更容易。	A Working Holiday Visa allows you to work and travel in Canada for a year to two. The work opportunities offered within the working holiday program require little to no experience. This element makes it easier for those Dominicans who may feel as if they don’t have the requisite qualifying criteria to immigrate to Canada.
	
对于那些对工作假期不感兴趣的人，IEC 提供了两种可供选择的方法，作为一个年轻的多米尼加人，您可以使用这些方法移民到加拿大。青年专业人士面向希望在加拿大工作场所的所选领域获得必要经验的应届毕业生。	For those not interested in a working holiday, IEC offers two alternative methods that as a young Dominican you can use to immigrate to Canada. The Young Professionals is aimed at recent graduates who want to gain the requisite experience in their chosen field within the Canadian workplace.
	
国际学生合作社是一项学生交流计划，为符合条件的学生提供在加拿大精英大学学习的机会。	The International Student Co-operative is a student exchange program that offers students that possess the right qualifying criteria an opportunity to study at an elite Canadian university.
	
在 IEC 提供的任何一个项目中获得的经验最终将对未来永久移民加拿大的前景非常有帮助，因为 IRCC 优先考虑在加拿大生活和工作过的人获得永久居留权 (PR)。	The experiences gained while on any one of the programs offered by the IEC will ultimately be very helpful for any future prospects of permanently immigrating to Canada since the IRCC prioritizes people who have lived and worked in Canada for the grant of permanent residency (PR).
	
我们如何帮助您申请？	How We Can Help You Apply?
		
只有少数几个机构实际上有权向希望移民的候选人提供付费建议。这些机构之一是受监管的加拿大移民顾问 (RCIC)，他会评估您是否有资格通过不同途径获得永久居留权，并为您制定个性化的移民策略。我们与其中三位专家合作，他们自己都经历过申请期，可以在整个过程中为您提供帮助。	There are only a select few bodies who actually have the authority to give paid advice to candidates looking to immigrate. One of these authorities is a Regulated Canadian Immigration Consultant (RCIC) who assesses your eligibility for the different pathways towards permanent residence and develops a personalized immigration strategy for you. We work with three of these experts who have all been through the application period themselves and can give you a helping hand throughout the process.

常见问题	FAQs
	
### 完全没有工作经验的多米尼加人有机会移民吗？	Are There Opportunities For Dominicans With No Work Experience At All To Immigrate?
	
对于没有任何工作经验移民加拿大的多米尼加人来说，有很多工作机会。一般工作——涉及大量体力劳动——是该国需求量最大、最重要的劳动力市场之一，其中大部分工作几乎不需要工作经验。	There are plenty of work opportunities for Dominicans who don’t have any work experience to immigrate to Canada. General work-which involves a lot of menial labor- is one of the most in-demand and vital labor markets in the country and most of it requires very little to no work experience.
	
### 多米尼加共和国有没有与多米尼加相关的文化节？	Are There Any Dominican Related Cultural Festivals In The Dominican Republic?
	
随着加拿大多米尼加社区的蓬勃发展，出现了越来越多的以多米尼加文化和传统为特色的文化节日，特别是在加勒比地区的庆祝活动中。	With the number of booming Dominican communities in Canada, there has been a growing number of cultural festivals that feature Dominican culture and traditions, especially within Caribbean festivities.
	
### 加拿大对没有经验的体力劳动者有最低工资吗？	Does Canada Have A Minimum Wage for Menial Labor Workers With No Experience?
	
加拿大确实有全国适用的最低工资法案，但其中大部分是由各省根据该省的人口统计数据制定的。因此，体力劳动有最低工资，但设定的工资率将取决于具体行业，例如：医疗保健和您移民后居住的省份。	Canada does have a minimum wage bill that is applied nationally but most of it is set by each province in accordance with demographic statistics of that province. Therefore there is a minimum wage for menial labor work but the set rate will be dependent on the specific industry e.g. healthcare and the province that you reside in once you have immigrated.
