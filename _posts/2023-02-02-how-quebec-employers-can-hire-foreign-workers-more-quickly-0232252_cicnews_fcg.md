魁北克雇主如何更快地雇用外国工人 便利的劳动力市场影响评估 (LMIA) 帮助魁北克雇主有效解决该省的劳动力短缺问题。	How Quebec employers can hire foreign workers more quickly The facilitated Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) helps Quebec employers efficiently address labor shortages in the province.
	
如果加拿大雇主想雇用外国公民，他们通常必须通过劳动力市场影响评估 (LMIA) 获得加拿大政府的批准。 LMIA 的目的是确保雇用外国人不会对加拿大的工人产生负面影响。	If a Canadian employer wants to hire a foreign national, they must usually receive approval from the Canadian government through a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA). The purpose of the LMIA is to ensure that the hiring of a foreign national will not negatively affect workers in Canada.
	
政府必须得出结论，雇用外国国民将对加拿大劳动力市场产生积极或中性的影响。总的来说，应该清楚的是，没有加拿大人因有利于外国公民而放弃这份工作，他们将获得符合联邦和省级标准的薪水和福利。	The government must conclude that hiring the foreign national will have positive or neutral effect on the Canadian labour market. In general, it should be clear that no Canadians were passed up for the job in favour of the foreign national and that they will receive salary and benefits that meet federal and provincial standards.
	
在魁北克，便利流程并不免除雇主申请 LMIA 的责任。但是，魁北克雇主不需要为他们雇用外国工人的职位做广告。	In Quebec, the facilitated process does not exempt employers from applying for an LMIA. However, there are various occupations that Quebec employers are not required to advertise the position for which they are hiring foreign workers.
	
### 对魁北克雇主的要求	Requirements for Quebec employers
	
魁北克雇主不需要提供他们正在寻求填补的职位的招聘努力的证据，但他们应该在雇用外国工人之前尽最大努力招聘加拿大公民和永久居民。	The Quebec employer does not need to provide evidence of recruitment efforts for the position they are seeking to fill, but they should make best efforts to recruit Canadian citizens and permanent residents before hiring a foreign worker.
	
雇主还必须证明以下内容：	The employer must also show the following:
	
* 外籍工人符合工作的所有教育和经验要求以及国家职业分类的要求；	  The foreign worker meets all educational and experience requirements of the job and the requirements of the National Occupation Classification;
* 外国工作的小时工资与在同一职业和地理区域工作的加拿大人和永久居民的小时工资一致；	  That the hourly wage of the foreign work is consistent with that of Canadians and permanent residents working in the same occupation and geographical area;
* 所有高薪 LMIA 申请都需要一份过渡计划。但是，在魁北克的便利流程下，只有在同一职业和地点第二次或后续申请 LMIA 时才需要过渡计划。	  A transition plan is required for all high wage LMIA applications. However, under the facilitated process in Quebec, a transition plan is only required for the second or subsequent application for an LMIA in the same occupation and location.
