**笔记：**	**Note:**
	
我们想指出的是，全国家庭调查（NHS）的数据质量仍然受到批评，因为这项调查是在自愿的基础上进行的，因此它的有效性、可靠性和与人口普查等其他工具的可比性有成为一个问题。事实上，在首次公布NHS结果之前，加拿大统计局就在使用NHS数据时发出了警告和注意事项，因此请谨慎使用该数据。	We would like to point out that the quality of the data from the National Household Survey (NHS) is still under criticism because this survey was conducted on a voluntary basis, so its validity, reliability and comparability with other instruments, such as population censuses have become an issue. In fact, before the first release of the NHS results, Statistics Canada issued warnings and cautions when using the NHS data, so use this data prudently.
