IRCC 考虑根据职业和其他类别进行快速通道抽签 最近的磋商概述了针对具有职业、行业、临时居民和法语语言能力等关键属性的快速通道候选人的可能性。	IRCC considering Express Entry draws based on occupations, and other categories Recent consultations outline the possibility of targeting Express Entry candidates who have key attributes such as occupation, sector, being a temporary resident, and French language proficiency.
	
加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 最近与公众和利益相关者进行了磋商，以调整快速入境申请管理系统，以更好地满足加拿大的经济需求和劳动力短缺问题。	Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) recently held consultations with the public and stakeholders to adapt the Express Entry application management system to better target Canada’s economic needs and labour shortages.
	
该部门计划通过创建快速通道类别来做到这一点，这些类别针对教育证书、工作经验或官方语言知识等关键属性，而不仅仅是综合排名系统 (CRS) 中的高分。	The department plans to do this by creating Express Entry categories that target key attributes such as educational credentials, work experience, or knowledge of an official language, rather than solely on a high score within the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS).
	
IRCC 表示，它正在考虑根据职业背景、劳动力短缺的经济部门、候选人是否以国际学生或临时外籍工人的身份居住在加拿大，以及候选人的法语水平来邀请 Express Entry 候选人。	IRCC said it is considering inviting Express Entry candidates based on occupational background, sectors of the economy with labour shortages, whether candidates have resided in Canada as international students or temporary foreign workers, and the French-language proficiency of candidates.
	
Express Entry 是一种系统，技术工人可以通过三种移民途径之一申请永久居留权，即联邦技术工人计划、加拿大经验类和联邦技术贸易计划。	Express Entry is a system under which skilled workers may apply for permanent residence through one of three immigration pathways, the Federal Skilled Worker Program, the Canadian Experience Class, and the Federal Skilled Trades Program.
	
目前，通过这些项目申请永久居留权的合格候选人将使用 CRS 获得分数。得分最高的人最有可能收到申请邀请 (ITA)。	Currently, eligible candidates who apply for permanent residency through these programs are given a score using the CRS. Those with the highest scores are most likely to receive an invitation to apply (ITA).
	
磋商是基于用于制定年度移民水平计划的相同方法的成功，该计划设定了加拿大三年内的年度移民目标。	The consultations werebased on the success of the same method used for creating the annual Immigration Levels Plan, which sets Canada’s yearly immigration targets over three years.
	
由于磋商过程最近才于 2023 年 1 月 8 日结束，因此磋商结果尚未公布。但是，IRCC 表示，有针对性的抽签可能会在今年春季开始。一旦部长决定了类别，它们将在发出邀请之前宣布。	The results of the consultations have not yet been published since the consultation process only recently ended on January 8, 2023. However, IRCC has said that targeted draws are likely to begin starting in spring this year. Once categories are decided on by the Minister, they will be announced before invitations are issued.
	
### 可能的类别	Possible Categories
	
**根据特定职业或部门的工作经验选择候选人**	**Selecting candidates based on work experience in a particular occupation or sector**
	
IRCC 正在考虑创建一个类别，其中包括在长期劳动力短缺的特定职业或部门的工作经验。作为咨询过程的一部分，IRCC 要求受访者概述劳动力市场长期短缺的领域，并就移民如何补充加拿大现有劳动力提出建议。	IRCC is considering creating a category that includes work experience in particular occupations or sectors that are experiencing chronic labour shortages. As part of the consultation process, IRCC asked respondents to outline areas of the labour market experiencing long-term shortages and provide suggestions on how immigration can complement Canada’s existing workforce.
	
在 2019 年至 2021 年期间，受邀通过快速通道申请永久居留权的候选人中，最常见的主要职业是：	Between 2019 and 2021 of those candidates invited to apply for permanent residence through Express Entry, the most common primary occupations were:
	
* 食品服务主管	  food service supervisors
* 行政助理	  administrative assistants
* 财务审计师和会计师	  financial auditors and accountants
* 零售销售主管	  retail sales supervisors
* 软件工程师和设计师	  software engineers and designers
* 广告、营销和公共关系方面的专业职业	  professional occupations in advertising, marketing and public relations
* 厨师	  cooks
* 计算机程序员和交互式媒体开发人员	  computer programmers and interactive media developers
* 信息系统分析师和顾问	  information systems analysts and consultants
* 用户支持技术人员	  user support technicians
* 餐厅和食品服务经理	  restaurant and food service managers
* 行政人员	  administrative officers
	
**将国际毕业生过渡到永久居留权**	**Transitioning international graduates to permanent residence**
	
IRCC 表示，快速通道中针对国际学生毕业生的潜在选择类别可以更直接地应对严重短缺。例如，一个新的“快速通道”类别可能包括拥有指定学习机构的热门领域学位或文凭的毕业生。	IRCC says a potential category for selection in Express Entry focused on international student graduates could respond more directly to critical shortages. For example, a new Express Entry category could include graduates with a degree or diploma in in-demand fields from a Designated Learning Institution.
	
IRCC 指出，国际学生毕业生非常适合永久经济移民，因为他们精通至少一种官方语言，并拥有加拿大教育资格和工作经验。他们通常处于核心工作年龄，这意味着他们将能够在未来几年为加拿大的经济做出贡献。	IRCC notes international student graduates are well placed for permanent economic immigration since they are proficient in at least one official language and have Canadian educational qualifications as well as work experience. They are often in their core working-age years, meaning they will be able to contribute to Canada’s economy for years to come.
	
2021 年，超过 88,000 名国际毕业生通过快速通道过渡到永久居留权，自 2017 年以来增加了 80%。不过，对于持毕业后工作许可 (PGWP) 在加拿大的人来说，获得永久居留权可能既费时又困难.	Over 88,000 international graduates transitioned to permanent residence through Express Entry in 2021, an increase of 80% since 2017. Still, it can be time-consuming and difficult for someone to get permanent residence while in Canada on a Post Graduation Work Permit (PGWP).
	
**将临时外国工人过渡到永久居留权**	**Transitioning temporary foreign workers to permanent residence**
	
与国际学生毕业生一样，IRCC 正在考虑创建一个类别，使更多的临时外国工人能够通过快速通道成为永久居民。在磋商中，利益相关者提出了担忧，即目前的永久居留途径跟不上能够满足加拿大长期劳动力需求的临时外国工人的供应。临时外国工人计划提供接触全球人才的机会，在填补紧急职位空缺时促进经济增长。	As with international student graduates, IRCC is considering creating a category that would enable more temporary foreign workers to become permanent residents via Express Entry.  In the consultation, stakeholders raised the concern that current permanent residence pathways are not keeping up with the supply of temporary foreign workers capable of addressing Canada’s labour force needs in the long run. Temporary foreign worker programs provide access to global talent, which promotes economic growth as urgent job vacancies are filled.
	
总的来说，已经发现具有以前在加拿大临时工作经验的移民可以更好地融入劳动力市场，并且能够更好地在需要时转移他们的技能。	In general, immigrants with previous temporary Canadian work experience have been found to have better labour market integration and are better equipped to transfer their skills when needed.
	
2021 年，约有 168,600 人从临时工作身份转变为永久居留，占经济移民类别入境人数的 64%。	In 2021, approximately 168,600 people transitioned from temporary worker status to permanent residence, representing 64% of admissions in the economic immigration category.
	
**选择法语和双语候选人**	**Selecting Francophone and bilingual candidates**
	
IRCC 还在考虑根据候选人的法语能力来邀请他们。这可能需要邀请讲法语和双语的候选人。	IRCC is also considering inviting candidates based on their ability to speak French. This could entail invitations to French-speaking and bilingual candidates alike.
	
2019年，加拿大启动法语移民战略，目标是到2023年底，4.4%的魁北克以外新移民讲法语。	In 2019, Canada launched the Francophone Immigration Strategy, which set a target of 4.4% of new immigrants outside of Quebec to be French-speaking by the end of 2023.
	
在 2017 年至 2021 年间定居加拿大的 110,000 名经济阶层法语移民中，只有 30,000 人选择在魁北克以外的地方定居。通过快速通道邀请更多的法语候选人，政府将能够继续加强加拿大的双语特征，并填补需要说法语的社区的劳动力缺口。	Of the 110,000 economic class francophone immigrants who settled in Canada between 2017 and 2021, only 30,000 chose to settle outside of Quebec. By inviting more francophone candidates through Express Entry, the government will be able to continue strengthening Canada’s bilingual character, as well as fill labour gaps in communities where speaking French is necessary for an occupation.
	
### 加拿大劳动力短缺	Canada’s labour shortage
	
快速通道的变化是为了应对加拿大的人口老龄化和全球出生率最低的国家之一，每位妇女生育 1.43 个孩子。随着人口老龄化，对社会服务的需求增加，税基缩小。如果不增加技术工人的移民来支持加拿大的社会体系，例如医疗保健，那么在支持人口方面将面临严重困难。	The changes to Express Entry are in response to Canada’s aging population and one of the lowest global birth rates at 1.43 children per woman. As the population ages, there is increased demand for social services and a shrinking tax base. Without increasing immigration of skilled workers to support Canada’s social systems, such as healthcare, there would be serious difficulties in supporting the population.
	
随着全球经济向更绿色、数字经济和自动化的方向转变，一些最严重的劳动力短缺问题已经显而易见。短缺的部分原因是建筑、医疗保健以及专业、科学和技术服务等关键部门的技能差距和职位空缺增加。所有这些部门都需要长期和专门的培训。	Some of the most critical labour shortages have been made evident as the global economy shifts toward greener, digital economies and automation. The shortages are partly due to skills gaps and increasing job vacancies in key sectors such as construction, healthcare, and professional, scientific and technical services. All are sectors that require lengthy and specialized training.
	
### 政府对移民的授权	Government mandate on immigration
	
在最近的部长授权信中，一份概述政府优先事项的文件中，移民部长必须解决这些目标，其中包括：	In the most recent Minister’s mandate letter, a document that outlines the government’s priorities, the immigration minister must address these objectives, among others:
	
* 解决长期劳动力市场短缺和未来定位问题；和	  address chronic labour market shortages and positioning for the future; and
* 支持法语少数民族社区的法语移民和经济增长。	  support Francophone immigration and economic growth in Francophone minority communities.
	
为帮助实现这些目标，C-19 法案于 2022 年 6 月 23 日获得皇家批准。根据该法案，移民部长可以根据支持经济优先事项的关键属性邀请候选人进行快速入境。	To help meet these goals, Bill C-19 received royal assent on June 23, 2022. Under the Bill, the immigration minister can invite candidates for Express Entry based on key attributes that will support an economic priority.
	
这并不意味着 IRCC 将不再使用快速通道综合排名系统。符合特定类别标准的候选人将根据他们的 CRS 分数进行排名，其中排名靠前的候选人将被邀请申请。	This does not mean that IRCC will no longer be using the Comprehensive Ranking System for Express Entry. Candidates who meet the criteria for a particular category would be ranked according to their CRS scores and the top among them will be invited to apply.
	
基于类别的选择将仅适用于有资格参加“快速通道”管理的项目的候选人。	Category-based selection will only be for candidates who qualify for the programs managed under Express Entry.
