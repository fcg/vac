IRCC 邀请加拿大人直接影响未来的移民政策和计划，加拿大将这一举措称为“加拿大未来的移民系统”。	IRCC invites Canadians to directly influence future immigration policies and programs Canada is calling this initiative “An Immigration System for Canada’s Future”.
	
在昨天的新闻稿中，加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 宣布开始一项名为“加拿大未来的移民系统”的新“基础广泛的参与”项目。	In a press release yesterday, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) has announced the start of a new “broad-based engagement” venture called “An Immigration System for Canada’s Future”.
	
该计划强调合作，将着手利用收集到的公众意见和想法来帮助加拿大创建“一个强大、易于驾驭和适应变化的移民系统”。为了建立一个最佳的移民系统，加拿大认为公众舆论至关重要，因为“我们需要确保我们的政策和计划符合我们社区的需求。”	With an emphasis on collaboration, this program will set out to utilize collected public opinion and ideation to help Canada create “an immigration system that is strong, easy to navigate and adaptive to change.” To create an optimal immigration system, Canada believes public opinion will be crucial because “we need to ensure our policies and programs are aligned with the needs of our communities.”
	
### 这个倡议涉及什么？	What does this initiative involve?
	
从昨天在哈利法克斯举行的第一次面对面对话会议开始，由移民部长肖恩·弗雷泽本人主持，加拿大正在“发起这项……倡议，以提供\[加拿大人和广泛的其他利益相关者机会\]就我们如何为加拿大的未来建立一个更强大、更具适应性的移民系统分享他们的想法和观点。”	Beginning with a first in-person dialogue session in Halifax that took place yesterday, which was chaired by Immigration Minister Sean Fraser himself, Canada is “launching this … initiative to provide \[Canadians and a wide range of other stakeholders with the opportunity\] to share their ideas and perspectives on how we can build a stronger, more adaptive immigration system for Canada’s future.”
	
建立的目的是捕捉“多元化的观点”，将有机会通过这项努力提供意见和想法的许多团体包括“各级政府、企业、学术界、大专院校、安置组织，牵连加拿大的行业和我们的客户。”	Built with the intention of capturing “a diversity of perspectives”, the many groups that will be given a chance to provide input and ideas through this effort include “all levels of government, businesses, academia, post-secondary institutions, settlement organizations, implicated sectors in Canada and our clients.”
	
新闻稿称，从广义上讲，加拿大政府的这项努力将包括更多面对面的对话会议，例如在哈利法克斯举行的对话会议，以及“专题研讨会和针对公众和我们客户的调查”。	Broadly, this effort from Canada’s government will include more in-person dialogue sessions like the one in Halifax, as well as “thematic workshops and a survey for the public and our clients”, says the press release.
	
IRCC 表示，“[通过该倡议]收集的意见将为加拿大未来的移民政策和计划提供信息，并将帮助塑造一个在未来几十年造福全国社区的体系。”	IRCC says that “the input gathered \[through this initiative\] will inform Canada’s future immigration policies and programs and will help shape a system that will benefit communities across the country for decades to come.”
	
### 该计划的未来	The future of this initiative
	
目前，加拿大的“加拿大未来移民系统”倡议预计将持续到 2023 年春季，正如 IRCC 官方发布的那样，最后邀请全国各地的加拿大人参与。	At this time, Canada’s “An Immigration System for Canada’s Future” initiative is expected to continue through the spring of 2023, as noted in the official release from IRCC, which concludes by inviting the participation of Canadians across the country.
	
新闻稿称，那些“愿意为加拿大移民的未来做出贡献”的人将被邀请参加一项由 IRCC 发起的调查，该调查将在“三月下旬”向公众开放。要了解更多有关如何参与“塑造加拿大移民的未来”的信息，请在此处访问该倡议的加拿大政府专门网页。	Those who “would like to contribute to the future” of Canadian immigration, says the press release, are invited to partake in a survey that will be launched by IRCC and made available to the public “later in March”.

### 关于加拿大对移民的需求	About Canada’s need for immigration
	
这个国家最新的人口和人口普查数据突出了为什么像这样的举措对于优化加拿大的移民系统是必要的。	This country’s most recent population and census data highlights why initiatives like these are necessary to optimize Canada’s immigration system.
	
事实上，2022 年加拿大迎来了创纪录的新永久居民人数（437,000 多人），距离移民占加拿大人口百分比 (23%) 的新纪录仅过去一年。进一步确定移民对加拿大繁荣的重要性是移民“帮助振兴加拿大的\[老龄化\]人口”这一现实，因为 2016 年至 2021 年该国近三分之二的移民处于 25 岁至 54 岁的核心工作年龄之间岁。	In fact, 2022 saw Canada welcome a record-high number of new permanent residents (437,000+), just one year after setting a new record for the percentage of Canada’s population accounted for by immigrants (23%). Further establishing the importance of immigration to Canada’s prosperity is the reality that immigrants are “helping rejuvenate Canada’s \[aging\] population”, as almost two-thirds of this country’s immigrants from 2016-2021 are between the core working ages of 25 and 54 years old.
