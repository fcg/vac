加拿大今天举行了今年的第二次快速通道抽签。	Canada held the second Express Entry draw of the year today.
	
加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 向 5,500 名最低综合排名系统 (CRS) 分数为 490 分的候选人发出了邀请。没有指定任何项目，这意味着符合条件的候选人被邀请来自加拿大经验类 (CEC)、联邦技术工人计划(FSWP) 和联邦技术贸易计划 (FSTP)。所有这些都是在 Express Entry 系统下运行的程序。	Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) issued invitations to 5,500 candidates with a minimum Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) score of 490. No program was specified, meaning eligible candidates were invited from the Canadian Experience Class (CEC), Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP) and the Federal Skilled Trades Program (FSTP). All are programs that operate under the Express Entry system.
	
抽签是一个惊喜，因为它标志着连续几周的第二轮快速通道邀请。 IRCC 刚刚于 1 月 11 日星期三举行了抽签，其中还邀请了 5,500 名候选人。上周抽签的 CRS 截止分数为 507，这意味着 CRS 截止分数在抽签之间下降了 17 分。 IRCC 最初也将此次抽签的分数报告为 507，但此后已将其更新为正确分数 490。上周的抽签是自 2022 年 11 月 23 日抽签以来的首次抽签。快速通道抽签往往大约每两周进行一次，通常在周三进行。 IRCC 没有解释为什么在此期间暂停抽奖。	The draw was a surprise as it marked the second Express Entry round of invitations in consecutive weeks. IRCC had just held a draw last Wednesday January 11 in which it also invited 5,500 candidates. The CRS cut-off for last week’s draw was 507, meaning the CRS cut off score has dropped 17 points between draws. IRCC initially reported the score as 507 for this draw as well but it has since been updated to the correct score of 490. Last week’s draw marked the first since the November 23, 2022 draw. Express Entry draws tend to occur approximately every two weeks, usually on Wednesday. IRCC has not provided explanation on why there was a pause in draws over this period.
	
尽管如此，从 2023 年开始连续几周进行抽签这一事实表明，IRCC 希望今年在加拿大吸引更多技术移民。已经签发的 11,000 个 ITA 标志着 Express Entry 自 2015 年推出以来的最快启动，超过了 2021 年 1 月签发的 10,000 个 ITA 的先前记录。	Nonetheless, the fact that draws have taken place in successive weeks to start 2023 indicate IRCC’s desire to land more skilled immigrants in Canada this year. The 11,000 ITAs already issued mark the fastest start to Express Entry since it was launched in 2015, eclipsing the previous record of 10,000 ITAs that were issued in January 2021.
	
Express Entry 的服务标准是在短短六个月内为大多数成功的候选人提供永久居留权，这是加拿大所有 100 多种不同技术移民途径中最快的服务标准。	Express Entry has a service standard of providing permanent residence to most successful candidates in just six months, which is the fastest service standard among all of Canada’s over 100 different skilled immigration pathways.
	
快速通道今年的快速开端是 IRCC 主要技术移民途径可能多事的一年的一部分。	The fast start to the year for Express Entry is part of what is likely to be an eventful year for IRCC’s main skilled immigration pathway.
	
### IRCC 为有针对性的 Express Entry 抽签开发类别	IRCC developing categories for targeted Express Entry draws
	
自去年 6 月 C-19 法案获得皇家批准以来，IRCC 一直致力于为 Express Entry 项目的候选人创建新的抽签类别。这与目前仅根据综合排名系统 (CRS) 中的高分邀请候选人的方法大相径庭。	Since Bill C-19 received royal assent last June, IRCC has been working to create new draw categories for candidates in Express Entry programs. This is a major departure from the current method of inviting candidates based solely on a high score within the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS).
	
在最近的一步中，IRCC 完成了与公众和利益相关者的一轮磋商，以更好地了解加拿大最严重的技术工人短缺问题。	In its most recent step, IRCC completed a round of consultations with the public and stakeholders to better understand Canada’s most acute shortages of skilled workers.
	
无论类别如何，所有候选人都必须有资格在现有的快速通道申请管理系统下申请。	Regardless of the category, all candidates must be eligible to apply under the existing Express Entry application management system.
	
一旦部长决定了类别，它们将在发出邀请之前宣布。	Once categories are decided on by the Minister, they will be announced before invitations are issued.
	
### 目标抽奖的可能类别	Possible categories for targeted draws
	
这些类别将基于候选人的属性，例如他们的职业、工作经验、教育和语言能力。移民部长表示，这将通过邀请更有能力填补加拿大劳动力紧迫缺口的候选人来支持加拿大的经济优先事项。	The categories will be based on candidate’s attributes such as their occupation, work experience, education, and language abilities. The immigration minister says this will support Canada’s economic priorities by inviting candidates who are better placed to fill urgent gaps in Canada’s labour force.
	
可能会针对具有与劳动力需求部门相关的特定工作经验的快速通道候选人进行抽签。	Draws may take place to target Express Entry candidates who have specific work experience that is relevant to an in-demand sector of the workforce.
	
IRCC 也有可能创建类别，以帮助加拿大的国际学生通过快速通道成为永久居民，特别是如果学生已经从指定学习机构获得了热门领域的学位或文凭。	There is also the possibility that IRCC will create categories to help international students in Canada become permanent residents through Express Entry, particularly if the student has obtained a degree or diploma for an in-demand field from a Designated Learning Institution.
	
出于类似的原因，临时居民也被视为一个类别。那些曾有过加拿大临时工作经验的人被发现能更好地融入劳动力市场，并且有能力在需要时转移他们的技能。	Temporary residents are being considered as a category for similar reasons. Those who have previous temporary Canadian work experience have been found to have better labour market integration and are well-equipped to transfer their skills when needed.
	
熟练的讲法语的移民在获得 ITA 方面也可能有优势，因为政府寻求履行其加强加拿大双语特征的使命，并填补需要讲法语的社区的劳动力缺口。	Skilled, French-speaking immigrants may also have an advantage in receiving an ITA as the government seeks to deliver on its mandate to strengthen Canada’s bilingual character, as well as fill labour gaps in communities where speaking French is necessary for an occupation.
	
### 什么是快速通道？	What is Express Entry?
	
Express Entry 是三个加拿大移民计划的申请管理系统：加拿大经验类移民计划 (CEC)、联邦技术工人计划 (FSWP) 和联邦技术贸易计划 (FSTP)。快速通道池中的省提名计划 (PNP) 候选人已经有资格参加其中至少一项计划。	Express Entry is the application management system for three Canadian immigration programs: the Canadian Experience Class (CEC), the Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP) and the Federal Skilled Trades Program (FSTP). Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) candidates in the Express Entry pool are already eligible for at least one of these programs.
	
Express Entry 使用基于积分的系统，即综合排名系统 (CRS)，对候选人的个人资料进行排名。得分最高的候选人会收到申请邀请 (ITA)，然后可以申请永久居留权。	Express Entry uses a points-based system, the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS), to rank candidates’ profiles. The top-scoring candidates receive an Invitation to Apply (ITA) and can then apply for permanent residency.
	
候选人申请后，IRCC 官员会审查申请并决定是否批准。一旦完成并获得批准，候选人现在就是加拿大的永久居民，离成为加拿大公民又近了一步。	After the candidate applies, an IRCC officer reviews the application and decides if they are approved. Once this is complete, if approved, the candidate is now a permanent resident of Canada and one step closer to becoming a Canadian citizen.
