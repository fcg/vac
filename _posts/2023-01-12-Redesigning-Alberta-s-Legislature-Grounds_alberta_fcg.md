每年，数以万计的艾伯塔人都会到立法机关场地野餐、在泳池里游泳、散步，并参加社区、教育和宗教活动。Every year, tens of thousands of Albertans visit the Legislature grounds to picnic, wade in the pools, walk, and attend community, educational, and religious events.

为了帮助游客继续在场地上留下持久的回忆，艾伯塔省政府正准备翻新立法机关的北广场场地。该项目将改善水景周围的人行道和混凝土平台，翻新倒影池和装饰性圆顶喷泉，并全面重新设计阶梯式浅水池。To help visitors continue to create lasting memories on the grounds, Alberta’s government is preparing to renovate the north plaza grounds of the Legislature. The project will improve the walkways and concrete decking around the water features, refurbish the reflecting pool and ornamental dome fountain, and completely redesign the terraced wading pool.

艾伯塔人将被要求从梯田浅水池区域的三个不同概念中选择他们最喜欢的设计，包括对他们来说最重要的元素和特征。此反馈将有助于为最终设计提供信息。Albertans will be asked to choose their favourite design from three different concepts for the terraced wading pool area, including which elements and features are the most important to them. This feedback will help to inform the final design.

> “我们正在确保所有艾伯塔人都能访问和享受立法机关的水景设施，方便、安全和有趣。我很高兴看到艾伯塔人为我们的新浅水池选择的方向。”“We are ensuring that the Legislature water features are accessible, safe, and fun for all Albertans to visit and enjoy. I am excited to see the direction Albertans choose for our new wading pool.”

> “参观立法机关场地的游泳池和喷泉是许多艾伯塔人的夏季亮点，我很高兴这个项目在设计过程中考虑了艾伯塔人的意见。”“Visiting the pools and fountains at the Legislature grounds are a summer highlight for many Albertans, and I am thrilled that this project is taking the input of Albertans into consideration as part of the design process.”
