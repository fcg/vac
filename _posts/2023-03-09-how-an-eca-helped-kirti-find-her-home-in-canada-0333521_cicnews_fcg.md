2013 年，Kirti Tambe 从印度移居美国，在纽约大学 (NYU) 攻读硕士学位时，她正在寻找新的机会。	Kirti Tambe was seeking new opportunities when she moved from India to the United States in 2013 to pursue a master’s degree from New York University (NYU).
	
在印度获得计算机科学与工程专业的本科学位后，Kirti 因渴望体验自己祖国以外的生活而来到纽约大学。她已经知道自己想获得硕士学位，正如她解释的那样，“当我被纽约大学录取时，就是这样。我想去纽约。”	After receiving an undergraduate degree in computer science and engineering in India, Kirti was led to NYU by a desire to experience life outside of her home country. She already knew she wanted to obtain a master’s degree and, as she explains, “When I got admitted to NYU, that was it. I wanted to go to New York.”
	
Kirti 在纽约大学攻读技术管理学位，因此在美国有一段重要的停留时间。“我在美国待了七八年，”她回忆道。	Kirti pursued a degree in technology management at NYU, which led to a significant stay in the U.S. “I was in the U.S. for seven to eight years,” she recalls.

由于美国移民身份的不确定性，Kirti 在大流行期间搬到加拿大后，现在已经在加拿大生活了将近三年。 “我持有学生签证，但我无法获得工作签证。这让我感到不稳定。不知道这种情况会持续多久，也不知道会发生什么，我想所有这些都促使我决定搬到加拿大。”	Kirti has been in Canada now for nearly three years after moving in the middle of the pandemic because of the uncertainty of her U.S. immigration status. “I was on a student visa, but I couldn’t get my work visa. It was making me feel unstable. Not knowing how long this was going to go on for and what was going to happen, I think all of that triggered my decision to move to Canada.”
	
Kirti 还说，在做出决定之前，她曾花时间了解移居加拿大的情况。 “我看到了这里的情况。我拿到了永久居留权，所以如果我搬到这里，事情会更稳定。”	Kirti also says that she took the time to see what moving to Canada would be like before she made a decision. “I saw how things worked over here. I got my permanent residency, so things would be more stable if I moved here.”
	
Kirti 在详细说明她决定来加拿大时，再次提到了确定性的概念。 “我想我已经到了需要稳定的人生阶段。基本上，我必须为自己做这件事。”	Elaborating on her decision to come to Canada, Kirti alludes again to the idea of certainty. “I think I had reached that point in life where I needed the stability. I had to do it for myself, basically.”
	
**成为加拿大永久居民**	**Becoming a Canadian Permanent Resident**
	
谈到她成为加拿大永久居民的旅程，Kirti 指出，她的部分过程是从世界教育服务 (WES) 获得教育证书评估 (ECA)，这是移民加拿大所必需的。	Talking about her journey to becoming a permanent resident in Canada, Kirti notes that part of her process was obtaining an Educational Credential Assessment (ECA) from World Education Services (WES) which is required for immigration to Canada.
	
ECA 用于评估在其他国家/地区获得的教育证书（学位、文凭、证书等）的等效性，并将其与加拿大标准进行比较。	An ECA is used to assess the equivalency of educational credentials (degrees, diplomas, certificates, and so on) earned in other countries, and to compare them to Canadian standards.
	
**注意：** 自 2013 年 4 月以来，WES 一直是加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 指定的五家 ECA 提供商之一。	**Note:** Since April 2013, WES has been one of five ECA providers designated by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC).
	
Kirti 解释说，从 WES 获得 ECA 很简单。 “我的大学必须将成绩单直接发送给 WES，这对我来说相当简单，”她说。 “大学尽了自己的一份力量，而 WES 及时得到了它，所以我在那里没有问题。”	Kirti explains that receiving an ECA from WES was straightforward. “My university had to send transcripts directly to WES, and that was fairly simple for me,” she says. “The university did their part, and WES got it in time, so I didn’t have issues there.”
	
Kirti 承认在这个过程中有一些步骤她不清楚。但她很快指出，由于 WES 提供的说明以及她从 WES 客户支持团队获得的帮助，她的困惑被最小化了。	There were some steps in the process which Kirti admits were unclear to her. But she quickly points out that her confusion was minimized because of the instructions that WES provided and the assistance she received from the WES customer support team.

**在加拿大的工作生活**	**Work Life in Canada**
	
Kirti 从 WES 获得的 ECA 也帮助她在职业生涯中更加无缝地从美国过渡到加拿大，她现在在加拿大多伦多总部担任 TD Bank 的高级业务分析师。然而，Kirti 的职业道路并非一帆风顺。 “当我搬到这里时，我没有工作，”她说。	Kirti’s ECA from WES also helped her transition more seamlessly in her career from the U.S. to Canada, where she now works as a senior business analyst for TD Bank at its Toronto headquarters. However, Kirti’s path to this career was not a straightforward one. “When I moved here, I didn’t have a job,” she says.
	
移民有时很难在加拿大找到工作，因为未来的雇主不了解他们的国际教育成就以及他们与加拿大标准的比较。这种混淆通常是由于不了解其他国家/地区的学生所教授的内容与加拿大所教授的内容相比缺乏了解。例如，从印度获得学士学位是否表明学位持有者可以在加拿大充分从事与在当地获得学士学位的人相同的工作？	Immigrants sometimes struggle to find a job in Canada because prospective employers do not understand their international education achievements and how they compare to Canadian standards. This confusion often arises from a lack of understanding of what material is taught to students in other countries compared with what is taught in Canada. For instance, does earning a bachelor’s degree from India suggest that the degree holder can sufficiently perform the same job in Canada as someone who obtained a bachelor’s degree locally?
	
ECA 可以通过明确确定国际获得的教育证书的等效性来提供帮助。 ECA 可以让雇主更容易根据国际候选人在另一个国家的教育成就来评估他们是否适合工作。	ECAs can help by clearly establishing the equivalency of an internationally earned educational credential. ECAs could make it easier for employers to assess an international candidate’s fit for a job based on their educational achievements in another country.
	
一旦 WES 收到、审查并接受所有必需的文件和费用，ECA 的处理时间约为 35 个工作日。这意味着获得 ECA 和 WES 的申请人可以迅速开始在加拿大建立自己的职业生涯。	Once WES receives, reviews, and accepts all required documents and fees, the processing time for an ECA is approximately 35 business days. This means applicants who obtain an ECA with WES can move quickly to begin establishing their career in Canada.
	
**注：** WES 还为在法国和其他法语国家接受教育的考生提供 ECA，WES 接受法语学术文件并提供法语客户支持。	**Note:** WES also offers ECAs for candidates educated in France and other Francophone countries, and WES accepts academic documents in French and offers French-speaking customer support.
	
现在，部分归功于 WES 的 ECA，Kirti 说她正是她想去的地方。	Now, thanks in part to her ECA from WES, Kirti says that she is exactly where she wants to be.
	
“我一直在寻找并与其他几家公司合作。但我想我已经到达了我想去的地方，”Kirti 分享道。	“I was looking for and worked with a couple of other companies. But I think I landed where I want to be,” Kirti shares.

**加拿大就业以外的生活**	**Life in Canada Beyond Employment**
	
除了建立自己的事业之外，Kirti 还抽出时间与她的社区互动。 “除了与道明银行合作外，我还在做一些志愿者工作。现在我有时间考虑我想做的其他事情，”她说。	Beyond building her career, Kirti is finding time to engage with her community. “Besides working with TD Bank, I am doing some volunteer work. Now I have time where I can think about the other things I want to do,” she says.
	
在业余时间，Kirti 自愿参与 Together Project，这是一项位于多伦多的慈善计划，旨在帮助新来加拿大的难民。像 Kirti 这样的志愿者与一个难民家庭相匹配，他们帮助他们在加拿大安顿下来。 “根据家人的需要和我的技能，他们安排了我们，在大约六个月的时间里，我们与他们一起工作，帮助他们做任何他们需要的事情。基本上，任何结算流程或他们需要帮助的任何事情，”Kirti 解释道。	In her spare time, Kirti volunteers with Together Project, a Toronto-based charitable initiative that assists refugees who are new to Canada. Volunteers like Kirti are matched with a refugee family whom they help with settling down in Canada. “According to the needs of the family and what skills I have, they set us up, and over the course of about six months, we work with them and help them with anything they need. Any settlement processes or anything that they need help with basically,” Kirti explains.
	
当她谈到为什么她自愿参加 Together Project 时，Kirti 指出她可以与她一起工作的难民产生共鸣。 “因为你已经经历了这个过程，所以你可以理解他们的斗争。你可以指导他们。这些人带着家人和孩子进来。您可以做很多事情来帮助他们。我认为这对我来说很棒。”	When she talks about why she volunteers with Together Project, Kirti points out that she can relate to the refugees she works with. “You can relate to their struggle since you’ve been through the process. You can guide them. These people come in with families and kids. There’s so much that you can do to help them. And I think that’s been great for me.”
	
**给新人的建议**	**Advice for Newcomers**
	
Kirti 说，她对其他考虑移居加拿大的人的建议在很大程度上取决于他们的目标。	Kirti says her advice for others considering a move to Canada largely depends on the person’s goals.
	
“每个人都有不同的目标和想搬到这里的原因。如果你真的想搬到加拿大并质疑这是否是正确的举动，我的建议是毫无顾虑地继续前进。”	“Everybody has different goals and reasons they would want to move here. If you really want to move to Canada and questioning if it’s the right move, my advice would be to go ahead without any apprehensions.”
	
移民到一个新的国家可能会遇到挑战，但正如 Kirti 所说，移居加拿大最终是值得的。	Immigrating to a new country may come with challenges but as Kirti shared, making the move to Canada was ultimately worth the journey.
	
“每个国家/地区都有不同的\[可以提供的东西]并且有利有弊，所以这取决于你在寻找什么。但我会说去吧。不要事后猜测。这对你来说会很顺利——事业、个人成长，一切。”	“Every country has different \[things to offer\] and has pros and cons, so it depends on what you are looking for. But I would say go for it. Don’t second-guess it. It’s going to work out well for you—career, personal growth, everything.”
