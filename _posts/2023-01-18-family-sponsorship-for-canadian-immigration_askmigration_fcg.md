家庭类移民是加拿大移民水平计划下的第二大新移民类别。家庭班级赞助旨在帮助远隔千里的家庭团聚。加拿大公民和永久居民可以担保近亲，以便将他们带到加拿大成为该国的永久居民。到 2022 年，加拿大的目标是共接纳 105,000 名家庭类新移民，25,000 名来自父母和祖父母计划 (PGP) 的新移民，以及 80,000 名配偶、伴侣和子女。	Family class immigration is the second largest category of newcomers under Canada’s Immigration Levels Plan. Family Class Sponsorship is designed to reunite families who are separated by distance. Canadian citizens and permanent residents may sponsor close family members in order to bring them to Canada as permanent residents of the country. In 2022, Canada aims to welcome a total of 105,000 newcomers under family class, 25,000 from the Parents and Grandparents Program (PGP) and 80,000 Spouses, Partners, and Children.
	
**加拿大的家庭担保要求**	**Family Sponsorship Requirements in Canada**
	
**赞助商的资格**	**Eligibility of a Sponsor**
	
为了有资格成为家庭成员的担保人，您必须向加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 证明您是：	In order to qualify as a sponsor for a family member, one must demonstrate to Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) that you are:
	
* 加拿大公民或加拿大永久居民	  A Canadian citizen or permanent resident of Canada
* 18 岁或以上	  18 years of age or older
* 能够支持被担保人数年	  Able to support the sponsored person for several years
	
**你可以赞助谁**	**Who you can Sponsor**
	
加拿大公民或永久居民可以担保他们的直系亲属，包括	A Canadian citizen or permanent resident may sponsor their immediate family members, including
	
* 配偶、同居伴侣和婚姻伴侣	  Spouses, common-law partners, and conjugal partners
* 子女 	  Children
* 父母	  Parents
* 祖父母	  Grandparents
	
加拿大人只能在非常特殊的情况下担保亲属，如兄弟、姐妹、阿姨或叔叔。	Canadians can only sponsor relatives like brothers, sisters, aunts or uncles in very specific situations.
	
**配偶或伴侣的担保 Sponsorship for Spouse or Partner**
	
为了担保您的配偶或伴侣，您或您的伴侣可以作为内陆申请人或外地申请人申请。如果您和您的伴侣在申请时已经在加拿大同居，那么您可以作为内陆申请人申请。在这种情况下，被担保人在担保申请过程中不必离开加拿大。	In order to sponsor your spouse or partner, you or your partner may either apply as an inland applicant or an outland applicant. If you and your partner are already living together in Canada at the time of application, then you may apply as an inland applicant. In this case, the sponsored person will not have to leave Canada during their sponsorship application process.  
如果您或您的伴侣在申请时居住在加拿大境外，则您必须以境外申请人的身份进行申请。在整个担保过程中，只有加拿大公民才能与其在加拿大境外的外国配偶同住。另一方面，选择外地选择的永久居民必须在申请过程中留在加拿大，而他们的配偶则在加拿大境外。	If you or your partner is living outside of Canada at the time of application, you will have to apply as an outland applicant. Only Canadian citizens can live with their foreign spouses outside of Canada throughout the sponsorship process. Permanent residents on the other hand taking the outland option must remain in Canada and their spouse outside of Canada during the application process.
	
担保配偶或伴侣的申请流程要求您同时提交以下两份申请：	The application process for sponsoring a spouse or partner require you to submit the following two applications at the same time:
	
* 您申请担保您的配偶或伴侣	  Your application to sponsor your spouse or partner
* 您的配偶或伴侣的永久居留申请	  Your spouse or partner’s permanent residence application
* 如果作为内陆申请人申请，您还可以随申请一起提交配偶开放式工作许可 (SOWP) 申请。	  In case applying as an inland applicant, you may also submit an application for a Spousal Open Work Permit (SOWP) along with your application.
