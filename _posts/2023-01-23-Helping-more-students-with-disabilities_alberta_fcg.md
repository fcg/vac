残疾人在获得和完成高等教育课程方面面临着一些最高的成本和最重大的障碍。他们还面临进入劳动力市场和毕业后保持稳定就业的众多挑战。	Persons with disabilities face some of the highest costs and most significant barriers to accessing and completing a post-secondary program. They also face numerous challenges entering the workforce and maintaining stable employment after graduation.

这就是为什么艾伯塔省政府正在扩大对残疾学生的支持，以包括那些长期或长期残疾的学生。这一变化将使每年获得这些财政支持的艾伯塔人总数超过 11,000 人，确保他们能够获得完成学业和成功事业所需的资金。	That’s why Alberta’s government is expanding supports for students with disabilities to include those with persistent or prolonged disabilities. This change will bring the total number of Albertans receiving these financial supports to more than 11,000 each year, ensuring they can access the funding they need to complete their studies and lead successful careers.

By increasing access to disability supports, we are ensuring vulnerable Albertans have the supports they need to pursue higher education and find rewarding careers.”

> “艾伯塔省的高等教育为成功和繁荣创造了机会。我们的政府致力于通过提高获得高等教育资金的机会来帮助残疾人获得同样的成功。通过高等教育获得的成功可以带来一生的成就，这就是为什么我们将继续确保所有人都能负担得起和获得机会。”	“Post-secondary education in Alberta creates opportunities for success and prosperity. Our government is focused on helping those living with disabilities find that same success through increased accessibility to funding for higher education. Success found through post-secondary education can bring a lifetime of achievement, which is why we will continue to ensure opportunities are made affordable and accessible for all.”

This will undoubtedly strengthen broader accessibility efforts and help ensure that students with disabilities receive the support they need.”
