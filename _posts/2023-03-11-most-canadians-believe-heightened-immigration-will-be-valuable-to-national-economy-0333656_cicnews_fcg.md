# 大多数加拿大人认为增加移民将对国民经济有价值 52% 的民意调查受访者认为加拿大的移民政策将对该国经济产生“积极或有点积极”的影响。	Most Canadians believe heightened immigration will be valuable to national economy 52% of poll respondents feel Canada’s immigration policy will have a “positive or somewhat positive” impact on the country’s economy.
来自加拿大城市人口中心的报告表明，由于“人口爆炸式增长”，这些地区的租金价格正在“飙升”。	Reports from urban population centres across Canada suggest that rent prices in these areas are “soaring” as a result of “explosive population growth.”
	
这正在创造条件，要求许多加拿大人离开大城市并在其他社区寻找更多负担得起的住房。	This is creating conditions that are requiring many Canadians to leave major cities and find more affordable housing in other communities.
	
此外，人们认为移民可能会创造出该国可能无法跟上的需求水平，从而损害加拿大的住房市场。事实上，根据加拿大皇家银行经济学家罗伯特霍格的说法，加拿大需要“到 2025 年每年至少建造 270,000 套[新住房]”才能满足预期需求。	Additionally, there is a belief that immigration may compromise the Canadian housing market by creating a level of demand that the country may not be able to keep up with. In fact, according to Royal Bank of Canada economist Robert Hogue, Canada would need to build at least “270,000 \[new housing\] units per year by 2025” to stay in line with expected demand.
	
### 关于移民增加对经济影响的舆论	Public opinion on the economic impact of heightened immigration
	
尽管有此建议，但彭博社最近委托 Nanos Research Group 进行的一项民意调查表明，大多数接受调查的加拿大人仍然关注他们预计移民对经济产生的积极影响。	In spite of this suggestion, a recent Bloomberg-commissioned poll from Nanos Research Group indicates that the majority of polled Canadians remain focused on the positive impact they expect immigration to have on the economy.
	
以下分解了 1,012 名调查参与者的回答：	The following breaks down the responses of 1,012 survey participants:
	
- 超过一半（52%）的受访者表示，他们相信加拿大增加的年度移民目标将产生“积极或有点积极”的影响	-   More than half (52%) of respondents said they believe Canada’s increased annual immigration target will have a “positive or somewhat positive” effect
- 略高于三分之一 (38%) 的受访者表示，这一增长将产生“负面或略微负面”的影响	-   Slightly over one-third (38%) said this increase will have a “negative or somewhat negative” impact
- 大约二分之一的受访加拿大人 (6%) “不确定”增加年度移民目标会对经济产生什么影响	-   Around 1-in-20 surveyed Canadians (6%) were “unsure” what economic impact would come from increased annual immigration targets
- 一小部分受访者 (4%) 表示他们认为加拿大增加移民目标对经济“没有影响”	-   A small contingent of respondents (4%) indicated that they believe Canada’s increased immigration target will have “no impact” on the economy
	
**注意：** 该调查是在 2023 年 2 月 26 日至 3 月 1 日期间通过在线和电话进行的	**Note:** This survey was conducted online and over the phone between February 26 and March 1, 2023
	
### 加拿大与移民的关系	Canada’s relationship with immigration
	
移民使加拿大成为七国集团中人口增长率最快的国家。预计这一趋势将与加拿大不断提高的移民目标保持一致，其中包括根据 2023-2025 年移民水平计划在 2025 年迎来 500,000 名新永久居民。	Immigration is allowing Canada to experience the fastest population growth rate of any country in the Group of Seven. That trend is expected to continue in line with Canada’s rising immigration targets, which include welcoming 500,000 new permanent residents in 2025 in line with the Immigration Levels Plan for 2023-2025.
	
**注：**截至 2021 年，人口普查数据显示移民占加拿大总人口的 23%	**Note:** As of 2021, census data indicates that immigrants make up 23% of Canada’s total population
	
预计这将遵循 2024 年 485,000 人的移民目标和今年 465,000 人的目标。	This is expected to follow an immigration target of 485,000 in 2024 and a target of 465,000 this year.
	
根据 Nanos 民意调查，自 2020 年 11 月以来，公众对今年目标的支持增加了 10%，而“约三分之一”的受访者表示，加拿大应该接受更少的永久居民，而 15% 的受访公众“希望国家引进更多的人。”	According to the Nanos poll, public support for this year’s target has increased by 10% since November 2020, while “about a third” of respondents say Canada should accept fewer permanent residents and 15% of the surveyed public “wanted the country to bring in more people.”
	
加拿大环境研究所与 Century Initiative 从 2022 年 10 月开始进行的一项调查进一步确立了公众对加拿大移民的支持。在这项调查中，“当被问及加拿大的移民水平太高了。”	Further establishing public support for immigration across Canada is a survey by the Environics Institute of Canada, in partnership with the Century Initiative, from October 2022. In this survey, “nearly 70% of Canadians were found to disagree or strongly disagree when asked if Canada’s immigration levels were too high.”
	
随后是今年 2 月的另一份 Century Initiative 报告。这份题为《公众舆论与移民：维护加拿大的优势》的报告强调了许多加拿大人支持移民的现实。移民尤其如此，因为它涉及来自危机国家的外国人，因为 76% 的加拿大人认为该国“应该接受更多来自发生重大冲突地区的移民”。	This was followed up by another Century Initiative report from February this year. The report, titled Public Opinion and Immigration: Maintaining Canada’s Advantage, reinforces the reality that many Canadians support immigration. This is especially true of immigration as it relates to foreign nationals from crisis-stricken nations, as 76% of Canadians believe that the country “should accept more immigrants from places experiencing major conflicts”.
	
这个数字比 1993 年增加了 42%，这表明加拿大人对移民的看法基本持积极态度。	This figure is an increase of 42% from 1993, making it evident that Canadians have a largely positive outlook on immigration.
	
### 努力收集更多关于移民的舆论	Efforts to gather more public opinion on immigration
	
为了让加拿大人有更多机会表达他们对移民的意见和信念，加拿大还启动了一项名为“加拿大未来的移民制度”的倡议。	In an effort to allow Canadians even more opportunities to express their opinions and beliefs on immigration, Canada has also begun an initiative called “An Immigration System for Canada’s Future”.
	
该合资企业将允许加拿大人参与对话会议、调查和其他活动，目的是分享“他们关于 \[加拿大\] 如何为加拿大的未来建立更强大、更具适应性的移民体系的想法和观点。”	This venture will allow Canadians to participate in dialogue sessions, surveys and other events for the purpose of sharing “their ideas and perspectives on how \[Canada\] can build a stronger, more adaptive immigration system for Canada’s future.”
	
这项倡议始于上个月由移民部长肖恩·弗雷泽 (Sean Fraser) 在哈利法克斯主持的讨论会，并将持续到春季，邀请各种利益相关者——包括“各级政府\[以及\]企业、学术界、邮政-二级机构、安置组织”——参与这些活动并让他们的声音被听到。	This initiative, which began with a discussion session led by immigration minister Sean Fraser in Halifax last month and will continue through the spring, invites stakeholders of all kinds – including “all levels of government \[as well as\] businesses, academia, post-secondary institutions, settlement organizations” – to participate in these events and allow their voices to be heard.
	
加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 指出，“[通过该倡议]收集的意见将为加拿大未来的移民政策和计划提供信息，并将帮助塑造一个在未来几十年造福全国各地社区的体系。”	Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) notes that “the input gathered \[through this initiative\] will inform Canada’s future immigration policies and programs and will help shape a system that will benefit communities across the country for decades to come.”
