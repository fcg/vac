安大略省、不列颠哥伦比亚省和马尼托巴省在最新的省提名计划抽签中发出邀请 三个省份本周已向候选人发出邀请。	Ontario, British Columbia and Manitoba issue invitations in latest Provincial Nominee Program draws Three provinces have issued invitations to candidates this week.
	
安大略省、不列颠哥伦比亚省和马尼托巴省已发出邀请，通过最近几轮的省提名计划 (PNP) 抽签向候选人提出申请。	Ontario, British Columbia and Manitoba have issued invitations to apply to candidates through their most recent rounds of provincial nominee program (PNP) draws.
	
大多数加拿大省和地区（魁北克和努纳武特除外）都有自己的 PNP。通过这些项目，有兴趣的候选人可能会被邀请申请省提名。获得省提名有利于获得永久居留权。	Most Canadian provinces and territories (except for Quebec and Nunavut) operate their own PNPs. Through these programs, interested candidates may be invited to apply for provincial nomination. Receiving a provincial nomination can be advantageous for gaining permanent residence.
	
魁北克的移民计划由该省管理，与加拿大的移民计划不同。魁北克省是唯一一个控制所有经济类移民的省份。	Quebec’s immigration programs are administered by the province and are distinct from Canada’s immigration programs. Quebec is the only province that has control over all economic class immigrants.
	
省提名计划 (PNP) 每年有 105,000 名永久居民。它始于 1998 年，此后每年 PNP 录取人数稳步增长。联邦和省政府都认为这是促进城市中心以外地区经济发展的有效工具。	The Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) accounts for 105,000 PR admissions per year. It began in 1998 and the annual number of PNP admissions has since increased steadily. Both federal and provincial governments consider it an effective tool to promote economic development outside of urban centers.
	
### 省移民结果1月22日-1月27日	Provincial immigration results January 22-January 27
	
**安大略**	**Ontario**
	
1月24日，安大略省共向安大略省移民提名计划（OINP）的雇主工作机会：国际学生类别的候选人发出了620份邀请。这是一个普遍的平局，这意味着没有针对性的职业。候选人需要至少 82 分才能收到邀请。	On January 24, Ontario issued a total of 620 invitations to apply to candidates in the Employer Job Offer: International Student stream of the Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program (OINP). It was a general draw, meaning there were no targeted occupations. Candidates required a minimum score of 82 to receive an invitation.
	
该流程适用于在技术职业中有工作机会的国际学生。工作机会必须属于国家职业分类 (NOC) 的 TEER（培训、教育、经验和责任）类别 0、1、2 或 3 的技术职业。	This stream is for international students with a job offer in a skilled occupation. The job offer must be in a skilled occupation at TEER (Training, Education, Experience and Responsibilities) category 0, 1, 2 or 3 of the National Occupational Classification (NOC).
	
1 月 25 日，安大略省还通过硕士研究生课程邀请了 692 名候选人。受邀候选人的最低分数为 44。	Ontario also invited 692 candidates through the Master’s Graduate stream on January 25. Invited candidates had a minimum score of 44.
