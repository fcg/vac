第一个也是唯一一个庆祝加拿大移民成功的国家奖励计划今年满 15 岁！在赞助商西联汇款的支持下，我们很自豪地公开征集 2023 年度加拿大移民奖前 25 名的提名。	The first and only national awards program celebrating immigrant success in Canada turns 15 this year! With the support of presenting sponsor Western Union, we are proud to open the call for nominations for the 2023 annual Top 25 Canadian Immigrant Awards.
	
前 25 名加拿大移民奖是分享移民鼓舞人心的故事和表彰他们对被收养国家的贡献的领导者。今天，随着移民人数的增加，与以往任何时候一样重要的是要打击负面的刻板印象，并关注移民如何克服系统性障碍以取得个人成功、回馈加拿大并成为新移民的榜样。今年的计划还得到了 COSTI 移民服务和 Windmill 小额贷款的支持。	The Top 25 Canadian Immigrant Awards is the leader in sharing inspiring stories of immigrants and recognizing their contributions to their adopted country. Today, with rising immigration numbers, it’s as important as ever to combat negative stereotypes and spotlight how immigrants overcome systemic barriers to achieve personal success, give back to Canada and serve as role models for newcomers.  This year’s program is also supported by COSTI Immigrant Services, and Windmill Microlending.
	
在过去几年中获得这一享有盛誉的国家奖项的移民包括国家男子足球队主教练约翰·赫德曼 (John Herdman)；加拿大首席统计师阿尼尔·阿罗拉 (Anil Arora)；名人餐厅老板 Vikran Vij；首席芭蕾舞演员 Chan Hon Goh；以及许多为社区和国家做出了不可思议贡献的无名英雄。	Immigrants who have been honoured with this prestigious national award in past years include national men’s soccer head coach, John Herdman; chief statistician of Canada, Anil Arora; celebrity restaurateur, Vikran Vij; prima ballerina, Chan Hon Goh; as well as many unsung heroes who have demonstrated incredible contributions in their communities and for the country.
	
“15 年前，我们 _Canadian Immigrant_ 推出了前 25 名奖项，以聚焦那些来到加拿大、取得伟大成就并让这个国家变得更美好的移民的故事，” _Canadian Immigrant_ 的出版商 Sanjay Agnihotri 说。 “每一年，我们都受到被提名并进入前 25 名的人的鼓舞，并且知道——即使是在 15 年后——还有很多其他的成功故事可以讲述。”	“Fifteen years ago, we at _Canadian Immigrant_ launched the Top 25 awards to shine a spotlight on the stories of immigrants who have come to Canada, achieved great things and made the country a better place,” says Sanjay Agnihotri, publisher of _Canadian Immigrant_. “Every year, we are so inspired by the people who are nominated and make it to the Top 25 and know — even a decade and a half later — that there are so many other success stories to tell.”
	
“我们很荣幸能够连续第二年赞助和表彰这些奖项，以及我们社区新成员所做的辛勤工作和牺牲，他们正在与世界各地的公民建立更牢固的联系，同时为整体经济做出贡献加拿大西联汇款总经理阿里·哈格纳斯 (Ari Hagnas) 说。	“We are honoured once again to sponsor and recognize these awards for the second year, as well as the hard work and sacrifices made by the new members of our community that are creating stronger bonds with citizens throughout the world, while contributing to the overall economic growth and well-being here at home,” says Ari Hagnas, Western Union general manager for Canada.
