加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 今天举行了 2023 年第四次快速通道抽签。他们邀请了 3,300 名候选人参加抽奖。他们需要至少 489 分的综合排名系统 (CRS) 分数才能被邀请参加抽奖。 Express Entry 抽签计划于 2015 年开始。今天是第一次只有联邦技术工人计划候选人可以参加。另一方面，这是今年第二次通过特定团体邀请进行抽签，第一次抽签是在 2 月 1 日进行的省提名抽签。	The Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) held their fourth Express Entry draw of 2023 today. They invited 3,300 candidates to the draw. They needed a minimum Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) score of 489 to be invited to the draw. The Express Entry draw program started in 2015. Today was the first time that only Federal Skilled Worker Program candidates could participate. On the other hand, it was the second draw this year with a specific group invitation, with the first being the provincial nomination draw on Feb 1st.

**什么是快速通道？**	**What Is Express Entry?**
	
Express Entry 是针对三个加拿大移民项目的申请管理系统。这些计划包括加拿大经验类计划 (CEC)、联邦技术工人计划 (FSWP) 和联邦技术贸易计划 (FSTP)。但是，省提名计划候选人自动有资格参加至少一项计划。	Express Entry is an application management system for three Canadian immigration programs. These programs include the Canadian Experience Class (CEC), the Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP), and the Federal Skilled Trades Program (FSTP). However, Provincial Nominee Program candidates are automatically eligible for at least one program.
	
Express Entry 计划使用基于积分的系统，称为综合排名系统 (CRS)，对参赛者进行排名以获得邀请。得分最高的候选人将获得申请邀请 (ITA)，然后可以申请永久居留权。	The Express Entry program utilizes a points-based system, call the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS), to rank contestants for an invitation. Candidates with the highest scores get an Invitation to Apply (ITA) and can then apply for permanent residency.
	
候选人提交申请后，IRCC 代表会评估申请并决定是否批准。一旦获得批准，候选人就成为加拿大的永久居民，离成为加拿大公民又近了一步。	After the candidate submits their application, an IRCC representative evaluates the application and decides if they are approved. Once approval is done, the candidate becomes a permanent resident of Canada and one step closer to becoming a Canadian citizen.
	
**2023 年的快速入境计划**	**The Express Entry Program in 2023**
	
自 2015 年启动快速通道计划以来，典型的例行程序是每两周后的周三举行抽签。然而，事情在2023年发生了变化。	Since the Express Entry Program started in 2015, the typical routine has been to hold draws on Wednesdays after every two weeks. However, things changed in 2023.
	
2022 年 11 月 23 日抽签后，有六周的等待时间，直到 1 月 11 日。根据 CIC News 从 IRCC 收到的一封电子邮件，暂停可能是由于他们的 IT 系统在实施 NOC 2021 时出现故障。	After the draw on November 23, 2022, there was a six-week wait until Jan 11th. According to an email CIC News received from IRCC, the pause might have been due to a glitch in their IT system when implementing NOC 2021.
	
1 月 11 日的抽签有 5,500 名候选人，最低 CRS 分数要求为 507。自该计划因 Covid 大流行而中断 18 个月以来，该抽签的截止分数最低，申请人数最多。	The Jan 11 draw had 5,500 candidates with a minimum CRS score requirement of 507. The draw had the lowest cut-off score and highest applicant number since the program’s 18-month hiatus due to the Covid pandemic.
	
接下来的一周进行了抽签，候选人数量相同，CRS 分数要求甚至更低，为 490。	There was a draw the following week with the same number of candidates and an even lower CRS score requirement of 490.
