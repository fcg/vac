#### 申请企业家流的邀请	Invitations to apply to the Entrepreneur Stream

2023 年 1 月 27 日，安大略省移民提名计划 (OINP) 发出了 10 份企业家流申请邀请。 2023 年 1 月 20 日之前提交的意向书有资格参加本轮考虑。	On January 27, 2023, the Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program (OINP) issued 10 invitations to apply under the Entrepreneur Stream. Expressions of interest scored by January 20, 2023 were eligible for consideration for this round.

收到分数在 137 到 162 之间的意向书发出申请邀请。	Invitations to apply were issued for expressions of interest that received a score of between 137 and 162.

如果您收到申请邀请，则无需联系该计划。您将收到两封电子邮件，其中包含登录信息和提交申请的说明。	If you received an invitation to apply, you do not need to contact the program. You will receive two emails containing login information and instructions for submitting an application.

如果您收到通知，表明您的意向书有资格收到申请邀请，但没有收到申请本轮的邀请，则意向书得分低于 137。意向书仍然有资格收到申请邀请自提交给 OINP 之日起 12 个月。	If you received a notice that your expression of interest was eligible to receive an invitation to apply but did not receive an invitation to apply this round, the expression of interest scored below 137. An expression of interest remains eligible to receive an invitation to apply for 12 months from the date it was submitted to the OINP.
