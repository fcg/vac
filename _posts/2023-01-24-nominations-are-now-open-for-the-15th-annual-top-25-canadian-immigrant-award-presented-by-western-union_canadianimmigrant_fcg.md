前 25 名加拿大移民奖是分享移民鼓舞人心的故事和表彰他们对被收养国家的贡献的领导者。今天，随着移民人数的增加，与以往任何时候一样重要的是要打击负面的刻板印象，并关注移民如何克服系统性障碍以取得个人成功、回馈加拿大并成为新移民的榜样。今年的计划还得到了 COSTI 移民服务和 Windmill 小额贷款的支持。	The Top 25 Canadian Immigrant Awards is the leader in sharing inspiring stories of immigrants and recognizing their contributions to their adopted country. Today, with rising immigration numbers, it’s as important as ever to combat negative stereotypes and spotlight how immigrants overcome systemic barriers to achieve personal success, give back to Canada and serve as role models for newcomers.  This year’s program is also supported by COSTI Immigrant Services, and Windmill Microlending.
	
在过去几年中获得这一享有盛誉的国家奖项的移民包括国家男子足球队主教练约翰赫德曼、加拿大首席统计师阿尼尔阿罗拉、名人餐厅老板维克拉姆维杰、首席芭蕾舞演员陈汉吴，以及许多表现出令人难以置信的无名英雄为社区和国家做出贡献。	Immigrants who have been honoured with this prestigious national award in past years include National Men’s Soccer Head Coach John Herdman, Chief Statistician of Canada Anil Arora, celebrity restaurateur Vikram Vij, prima ballerina Chan Hon Goh, as well as many unsung heroes who have demonstrated incredible contributions in their communities and for the country.

_“移民造成的影响不仅在加拿大这里，而且在全世界都能感受到，”西联汇款加拿大总经理阿里·哈格纳斯 (Ari Hagnas) 说。 “虽然他们的贡献在国内得到认可，但移民也在将钱汇回国内，帮助改善朋友和家人的生活，并加强其原籍国的当地经济。”_	_“The impacts made by migrants are not only felt here in Canada, but all over the world, said Ari Hagnas, Western Union General Manager for Canada. “While their contributions are recognized here domestically, migrants are also sending money back home, helping improve the lives of friends and families and strengthen the local economies of their originating countries.”_
