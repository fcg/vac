加拿大可能会加快地震灾区人民的移民申请	Canada May Fast Track Immigration Applications from People in Earthquake Zones
	
移民部长肖恩弗雷泽本周表示，加拿大可能会加快土耳其和叙利亚受地震影响的人的申请。	Immigration Minister Sean Fraser said this week that Canada may expedite applications from persons in Turkey and Syria affected by earthquakes.
	
上周一，即 2 月 6 日，土耳其西南部和叙利亚北部发生了两次大地震，摧毁了数千座建筑物。	Last Monday, 06 February, two huge earthquakes shook southwestern Turkey and northern Syria, demolishing thousands of structures.
	
经核实的死亡人数继续上升，土耳其和叙利亚之间有超过 40,000 人丧生。	The verified death toll continues to rise, with over 40,000 lives lost between Turkey and Syria.
	
弗雷泽表示，他的部门正试图分析加拿大移民系统对现有永久居留申请人的影响，以确定如何帮助他们。周三，加拿大派遣了一个灾难评估小组前往该地区，调查是否需要加拿大提供更多帮助。	Fraser stated that his department is attempting to analyze the impact on existing permanent residence applicants in Canada's immigration system in order to determine how to assist them. Canada dispatched a disaster assessment team to the region on Wednesday to investigate whether more Canadian help is required.
	
根据之前类似部署的例子，加拿大决定是否派遣灾难援助响应小组可能还需要几天时间。	Based on prior examples of similar deployments, Canada's decision on whether to send a Disaster Assistance Response Team might take a few more days.
	
获得永久居留权的途径：加拿大降低对看护人的工作要求	Pathways to Permanent Residence: Canada Reducing Work Requirements for Caregivers
	
加拿大已宣布计划降低对看护人的工作经验要求，并提供获得永久居留权的途径。这项于 2023 年 2 月宣布的新政策是在为护理行业工作人员提供更多权利和机会方面向前迈出的重要一步。	Canada has announced plans to reduce the work experience requirements for caregivers and provide pathways to permanent residence. This new policy, which was announced in February 2023, is a significant step forward in providing more rights and opportunities to those working in the caregiving industry.
	
根据新政策，看护人获得永久居留资格所需的工作经验已从 24 个月减少到 12 个月，并为之前有工作许可的看护人预留了一些空间。	Under the new policy, the work experience required for a caregiver to qualify for permanent residence has been reduced from 24 months to 12 months, with some spaces reserved for caregivers with previous work permits.
	
因此，看护人及其家人将受益于更快的永久居留权和在加拿大成功定居的道路。加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 计划通过减少在加拿大所需的工作经验来改进处理和申请。	Caregivers and their families will benefit from a speedier road to permanent residency and successful settlement in Canada as a consequence. Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) plans to improve processing and applications by decreasing the amount of work experience necessary in Canada.
	
据估计，这项修改将使目前正在处理的大约 90% 的申请受益，这将对新护理人员和已经在加拿大提供护理已有一段时间的人员有所帮助。	This modification is estimated to benefit around 90% of applications presently in processing, which will assist both new carers and those who have been providing care in Canada for some time.
	
> 根据移民、难民和公民部部长 Sean Fraser 阁下的说法，“看护人是加拿大家庭的一个重要选择，在许多成长中的孩子、年迈的父母和需要额外专业护理的人的生活中发挥了重要作用.通过将在加拿大所需的工作经验减少到一年，更多的看护人和他们的家人将有资格更快地过渡到永久居留权，这意味着他们可以在加拿大安顿下来并开始他们生活的下一章。”	> According to The Honourable Sean Fraser, Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship, “Caregivers are an important option for families in Canada and have played an instrumental role in the lives of many growing children, aging parents, and those who need additional specialized care. By reducing the work experience required in Canada to one year, more caregivers and their families will become eligible to transition to permanent residence sooner, meaning that they can settle down and start the next chapter of their lives here in Canada.”
	
政府宣布软化特鲁多临时签证政策	Government Announces Softened Approach to Temporary Visas Under Trudeau
	
总理贾斯汀·特鲁多表示，他希望加拿大移民系统放宽对签证处理的立场，并减少对旅行者逾期居留短期许可的风险的重视。	Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says he wants Canada's immigration system to relax its stance on visa processing and place less emphasis on the risk of travellers overstaying their short-term permits.
	
特鲁多表示，联邦移民制度正在接受加拿大解决劳动力短缺和其他迫使个人逃离家园的全球危机的需要的考验。	Trudeau stated that the federal immigration system is being tested by Canada's need to address labour deficits and other global crises that are forcing individuals to escape their homes.
	
特鲁多还表示，渥太华必须在帮助移民致富方面做得更好。否则，他认为，加拿大人对移民的积极态度可能会降温。	Trudeau also stated that Ottawa must do a better job of assisting immigrants to prosper. Otherwise, he believes, Canadians' positive attitudes toward immigration may cool.
	
> “反移民政党很难在加拿大取得成功，因为很多加拿大人都明白这有多么重要，”特鲁多说。 “我们需要保护加拿大人支持移民的事实。”	> “An anti-immigration party would have a hard time succeeding in Canada, because so many Canadians understand how important that is,” Trudeau said. “We need to protect the fact that Canadians are pro-immigration.”
	
快速通道：公共汽车和卡车司机现在有资格移民加拿大	Express Entry: Bus and Truck Drivers Now Eligible for Immigration to Canada
	
公交车和卡车司机现在可以使用快速通道。这一行动是加拿大为缓解全国公共汽车和卡车运输业司机短缺问题所做努力的一部分。	Express Entry is now available to bus and truck drivers. This action is part of Canada's effort to alleviate driver shortages in the busing and trucking businesses across the country.
	
加拿大移民、难民和公民部 (IRCC) 将于 2022 年 11 月 16 日从其国家职业分类 (NOC) 2016 系统过渡到改进的 NOC 2021 版本。	Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) will transition from its National Occupation Classification (NOC) 2016 system to an improved NOC 2021 version on November 16, 2022.
	
作为 NOC 2021 过渡的一部分，IRCC 批准了 16 个有资格快速入境的额外职业。增加的人员包括运输卡车司机和公共汽车司机，这两个行业在加拿大面临严重的劳动力短缺。	As part of the NOC 2021 transition, IRCC approved 16 additional occupations eligible for Express Entry. Among those added are transport truck drivers and bus drivers, two industries facing substantial labour shortages across Canada.
	
为了解决上述劳动力短缺问题，IRCC 已将运输卡车司机和公共汽车司机添加到有资格快速移民加拿大的工作清单中。	To address the aforementioned labour shortages, IRCC has added transport truck drivers and bus drivers to the list of jobs eligible for Express Entry immigration to Canada.
	
加拿大政府仍然乐观地认为，快速入境资格的扩大，以及快速入境的其他变化，如有针对性的抽签，将鼓励更多的外国人，特别是最适合填补该国最紧迫的劳动力缺口的技术工人来到加拿大未来。	The Government of Canada remains optimistic that this expansion of Express Entry eligibility, along with other changes to Express Entry such as targeted draws, will encourage more foreign nationals, particularly skilled workers best suited to fill the country's most pressing labour gaps to come to Canada in the future.
	
加拿大增加 150,000 个工作岗位：总理特鲁多为新移民敞开大门	Canada Adds 150,000 Jobs: PM Trudeau Opens Doors for New Immigrants
	
加拿大最近增加了 150,000 个新工作岗位，并拓宽了新移民的大门。此举是总理贾斯汀·特鲁多 (Justin Trudeau) 优先考虑经济复苏和移民融合的经济和社会政策的一部分。新增就业岗位遍布全国各个地区，涉及IT、医疗、教育等各个领域。这些工作提供相当于或优于行业标准的工资和福利。此举将提振加拿大经济，并帮助新移民更快地在该国定居。	Canada recently added 150,000 new jobs and widened its gates for new immigrants. The move is part of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's economic and social policies that prioritize economic recovery and integration of immigrants. The new jobs are spread across all regions of the country, in various sectors such as IT, healthcare, and education. These jobs offer wages and benefits equivalent to or better than the industry standards. This move will give a boost to the Canadian economy and help new immigrants settle in the country faster.
	
加拿大就业增长明显快于预期，引发了人们对加拿大央行是否已经结束加息周期的担忧。	Canadian employment increased significantly quicker than predicted, prompting concerns about whether the Bank of Canada has reached the end of its rate-hiking cycle.
	
由于移民，加拿大的人口正在显着增长，调查数据显示，包括学生和临时雇员在内的非永久居民的工作岗位正在大幅增加。劳动力参与率上升 0.3 个百分点至 65.7%，劳动力增加 153,000 人，即 0.7%。	Because of immigration, Canada is seeing significant population expansion, and survey data reveal that non-permanent residents — including students and temporary employees — are experiencing outsized job increases. The labor force participation rate rose 0.3 percentage point to 65.7%, as the work force expanded by 153,000 people, or 0.7%.
