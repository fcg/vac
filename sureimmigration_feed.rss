					<description><![CDATA[<p>Are you in Canada as a visitor, but would love to work if given the opportunity? Here's the good news: you can convert your visitor visa to a work visa from inside Canada, and you have until February 28, 2023, to do this!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>The Public Policy That Allows You to Apply for a Work Permit From Inside Canada</h2>



<p>Before the COVID-19 pandemic, you couldn&#8217;t apply for a work permit in Canada if you held a temporary resident visa. Instead, you must submit your work permit application to the visa office of your home country. You will have to leave Canada if approved and enter Canada again for it to come into effect. But with the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/service-delivery/coronavirus/temporary-residence/work-permit/visitor-work-permits.html">temporary public policy</a> issued on August 24, 2020, certain visitors in Canada can now apply for an employer-specific work permit without the need to leave the country. This policy, therefore, helps employers find workers and temporary workers to join the Canadian workforce.</p>

<h2>Who Is Eligible to Convert Their Visitor Visa to a Work Visa?</h2>



<p>To enable you to convert your visitor visa to a work visa from inside Canada:</p>



<ul>
<li>You must have a valid job offer.</li>



<li>Your visitor status is valid on the day of your application. If you have an expired visitor status, you must apply for the restoration of your status before submitting a work permit application.</li>



<li>You submit your application for an employer-specific work permit between August 24, 2020, and February 28, 2023.</li>
</ul>



<h2>Can I Do It If I Already Have a Work Permit Before? (or something like that?)</h2>



<p>Make sure to update it on November 16, 2022, so you will remain eligible for an ITA.&nbsp;<br>If you already received an ITA before this date, you should continue using the NOC 2016 for your permanent residence application.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>By November 16, 2022, Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) will replace the National Occupational Classification (NOC) 2021. From the skill type and skill level structure of the present NOC 2016 (NOC 0, A, B, C, and D), the TEER (training, education, experience, and responsibilities) categories and 5-digit occupation codes will now be in effect.</p>
<p>The post <a href="https://sureimmigration.com/understanding-the-changes-to-canadas-national-occupational-classification-2022/">Canada’s National Occupational Classification 2022 – Everything You Need to Know About the Changes</a> first appeared on <a href="https://sureimmigration.com">Sure Immigration</a>.</p>]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>What Will The New &#8216;TEER&#8217; System Consist of?</h2>



<p>The first and most significant change of the Changes to Canada’s National Occupational Classification 2022 system is the transition from the &#8216;NOC Code&#8217; categories to &#8216;TEER&#8217; categories, which stand for: Training, Education, Experience and Responsibilities.</p>



<p> <strong>The TEER categories include:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>TEER 0,</strong> management positions;</li>



<li><strong>TEER 1,</strong> occupations that usually require a university degree;</li>



<li><strong>TEER 2,</strong> occupations that usually require supervisory work, a college diploma, or two or more years of apprenticeship training&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>TEER 3,</strong> occupations that usually require a college diploma, apprenticeship training of fewer than two years or on-the-job training of more than six months</li>



<li><strong>TEER 4, </strong>occupations that usually require several weeks of on-the-job training or a high school diploma</li>



<li><strong>TEER 5,</strong> occupations that usually require no formal education and only short-term work demonstration</li>
</ul>



<p></p>

<h2>Are You An Existing Express Entry Candidate?</h2>



<p>Suppose you have already created an Express Entry profile but have not yet received an Invitation to Apply (ITA). In that case, you must update it using the TEER category and the 5-digit code appropriate to your occupation. Then, search for it on the&nbsp;<a href="https://noc.esdc.gc.ca/?GoCTemplateCulture=en-CA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ESDC website</a>. Remember to change the version to NOC 2021 Version 1.0.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You are eligible to either the Federal Skilled Worker Program or the Canadian Experience Class if your work experience falls within TEER 0, 1, 2, and 3. On the other hand, you can be eligible for the Federal Skilled Trades Program if your work experience is under the following groups of TEER 2 or TEER 3: Major Group 72, 73, 82, 83, 92, 93, Minor Group 6320, and Unit Group 62200.</p>



<p>Other eligibility criteria include language skills, amount of work experience, job offer, and education. Visit the Canada immigration website for the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/eligibility/compare/noc-2021.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">complete list of updates in the NOC 2021 eligibility criteria for Express Entry</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>If you want to sponsor your spouse to Canada, you should know that there are plenty of ways to do this successfully. But before you start with your Canada spousal sponsorship application, you must make sure that you are eligible to become a sponsor.</p>
<p>The post <a href="https://sureimmigration.com/canada-spousal-sponsorship-how-to-successfully-sponsor-your-spouse/">Canada Spousal Sponsorship – How to Successfully Sponsor Your Spouse</a> first appeared on <a href="https://sureimmigration.com">Sure Immigration</a>.</p>]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Canada Spousal Sponsorship</h2>



<p>Spousal sponsorship is a program initiated by <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/family-sponsorship/spouse-partner-children.html">Immigration,&nbsp;Refugees and Citizenship Canada</a> to help people in a relationship live together in Canada. You can help your spouse obtain permanent residency if you are a Canadian citizen or permanent resident who is eligible to sponsor.</p>



<p>If you want to sponsor your spouse to Canada, you must meet the following requirements:</p>



<ul><li>You are a Canadian citizen or permanent resident, and of legal age at 18 years old;</li><li>It would help if you are not a beneficiary of any government financial assistance program;</li><li>Your financial status indicates that you can provide financial support; and</li><li>You must have a clear record of any violent or sexual offence.</li></ul>



<p>Even common-law partners can also be eligible as sponsors. If you can prove that you are in a genuine relationship for at least 12 months, you can pursue your plan for Canadian spousal sponsorship.</p>



<h2>If I Marry a Canadian, Can I Move to Canada?</h2>



<p>On the other hand, if you are the one to be sponsored by a Canadian citizen whom you just married, it will take some time and effort before you can become a Canadian citizen. You need to prove that your relationship with your spouse is authentic.</p>



<p>Obtain a temporary visitor’s visa to set foot in Canada while waiting for the completion of the spousal sponsorship application process. You and your spouse can stay together in Canada while you can also process your request for a temporary work permit.</p>

</figure>



<h2>Ways to Prove a Genuine Marriage</h2>



<p>One of the essential factors in your Canadian spousal sponsorship application is the proof of marriage or the validity of a common-law partnership. Here are some considerations:</p>



<ul><li>Pictures of important events like the wedding, the honeymoon, or travels together;</li><li>Mails, phone records, and emails;</li><li>Affidavits subsidizing that your relationship is genuine;</li><li>Joint bank accounts, loan accounts, or any other joint accounts;</li><li>Co-ownership of any property;</li><li>Documents of cohabitation; and</li><li>Identification cards with the same address.</li></ul>



<p>The list of requirements for you to sponsor your spouse to Canada may be hard to accomplish. However, if you have a genuine relationship, it would be effortless to process your application thus, the success.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sureimmigration.com/contact-us" title="">Get help from a spousal sponsorship Canada consultant from Vancouver BC</a>.</p><p>The post <a href="https://sureimmigration.com/canada-spousal-sponsorship-how-to-successfully-sponsor-your-spouse/">Canada Spousal Sponsorship – How to Successfully Sponsor Your Spouse</a> first appeared on <a href="https://sureimmigration.com">Sure Immigration</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Do you plan to immigrate to Canada? Are you a student looking for an extra income source? Or are you searching for a job that will earn you permanent residency in a short while? If so, joining a caregiver program will help you achieve these goals. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Who is a Caregiver?</h2>



<p>A caregiver is anyone that takes care of anyone and assists them in their daily activities to help them live comfortably. The duration of caregiving can be short- or long-term, depending on why the person needs assistance. Caregivers are sometimes called carers.</p>



<h2>Responsibilities of a Caregiver</h2>



<p>The role you play as a caregiver depends on the type of job. The <a href="https://noc.esdc.gc.ca/"><u>National Occupation Classification</u></a> divides caregiving into two categories, home child care providers and home support workers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a home child care provider, you will:</p>



<ul><li>Babysit</li><li>Housekeep</li><li>Teach and play with children&nbsp;</li><li>Enforce parents’ disciplines</li></ul>



<p>On the other hand, a home support worker will:</p>

<h2>What Are the Benefits of Being a Caregiver?</h2>



<p>Taking care of another person is an important decision and requires your full attention. This is because you become a guardian when at work. As much as it is challenging, caregiving is beneficial and can be a meaningful experience for many. Some of them are:</p>



<h2>Finding Your Purpose</h2>



<p>Taking care of a child, an ill person or an older adult can give your life a new meaning. The fulfilment of seeing a child happy or an older adult remaining optimistic about life even with failing health can change you for the better. You may begin to see things differently and better understand certain aspects of life. After all, we chase life’s purpose and meaning daily.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Learning New Skills</h2>



<p>Some roles you will play as a caregiver help you think quickly and develop specific skills needed to survive emergencies. You will also get to understand what it takes to communicate clearly with people who may have some disorders like dementia.</p>

Learn new skills and selfless giving. " class="wp-image-56798" srcset="https://sureimmigration.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/miriam-g-u0TsofR4rH4-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://sureimmigration.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/miriam-g-u0TsofR4rH4-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sureimmigration.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/miriam-g-u0TsofR4rH4-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w, https://sureimmigration.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/miriam-g-u0TsofR4rH4-unsplash-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://sureimmigration.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/miriam-g-u0TsofR4rH4-unsplash-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>


<h2>Flexible Work Schedule</h2>



<p>Caregiving provides you with the perfect opportunity to combine studies and work. You can be a caregiver part-time and keep your old job, or be a full-time caregiver if you don’t like the idea of an office job. No matter your preference of work schedule, you will find the caregiving job that suits you. Working <a href="https://www.cic.gc.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=664&amp;top=29">full-time for a year</a> can get you a permanent stay, which is the first step if you want to become a citizen of Canada.</p>



<h2>Good Pay</h2>



<p>The median hourly pay for <a href="https://www.jobbank.gc.ca/wagereport/occupation/24770">Home Child Care Providers</a> in Canada is $16.63, while <a href="https://www.jobbank.gc.ca/wagereport/occupation/20667">Home Support Workers</a> are paid $17. At the end of the day, your salary depends on how many hours you are willing to work, putting you in control of your career and earning potential.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Start Communicating &#8211; Vocalize how you feel.</h2>



<p>Sure, you will go through some lonely moments when you first move, so those sad feelings should be expected. However, try not to let them get you down. Talk to those people who you run into in your daily life and express yourself to them. Let them know how you feel, and you might find someone just like you who needs a new friend.</p>



<h2>Join Meetups</h2>



<p>Meetups are great ways to socialize and meet fellow immigrants from the Canadian immigrant community. Joining is free, and there are always different experiences of signing up to meet and greet people. Hop on some Facebook groups dedicated to immigrants in Canada, or specifically for immigrants in your province or from your country &#8211; and start expanding your social circles.</p>

<h2>Stay Active</h2>



<p>Join a gym or running group to meet new people with similar exercise habits and interests. Aside from the social aspect, staying active has proven health benefits and helps reduce stress and depression associated with moving to a new country.</p>



<h2>Volunteer</h2>



<p>Volunteering is one of the best ways to become active in a community. Need some motivation to start volunteering? You can read about some of the pros of volunteering in this article.</p>



<h2>Start A Course</h2>



<p>Learn English or take a part-time course in a subject you&#8217;ve always been interested in &#8211; that way you can fulfil a dream while also meeting like-minded people.</p>



<h2>Visit a Park</h2>



<p>While at a local park, mix and mingle! People watching is a great way to start and learn about your surroundings. When you feel comfortable enough, you can make small talk with your neighbour on the bench or a friendly-looking dog walker.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="755" src="https://sureimmigration.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/mason-dahl-7AxXbZekDE-unsplash-scaled-e1653002189987-1024x755.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-56779" srcset="https://sureimmigration.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/mason-dahl-7AxXbZekDE-unsplash-scaled-e1653002189987-1024x755.jpg 1024w, https://sureimmigration.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/mason-dahl-7AxXbZekDE-unsplash-scaled-e1653002189987-300x221.jpg 300w, https://sureimmigration.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/mason-dahl-7AxXbZekDE-unsplash-scaled-e1653002189987-768x566.jpg 768w, https://sureimmigration.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/mason-dahl-7AxXbZekDE-unsplash-scaled-e1653002189987-1536x1133.jpg 1536w, https://sureimmigration.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/mason-dahl-7AxXbZekDE-unsplash-scaled-e1653002189987.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<h2>Go to the Library</h2>



<p>Become a library patron, and you automatically become friends of the library! This is a great place for community engagement. Just make sure you keep your voice down…. Shhhh…</p>



<h2>Ask for Help</h2>



<p>If you are struggling with social anxiety and unable to find new friends, ask for help. Asking your friends and family from back home if they know anyone in your area is a great way to meet people who are not complete strangers. Other options can be going to a church, mental health facility, or other trusted agency and seeing if they can help you connect with the community.</p>



<h2>Start a New Hobby</h2>



<p>Get into a new craft activity based on the new country or culture. Meeting people is a lot easier this way, AND you get to broaden your horizons!</p>



<h2>Hang Out at Cafes</h2>



<p>If you are a local, act like it by hanging out at the local coffee shops and cafes. The smaller, independently run shops are going to be the best for meeting the true blue locals of the community. And what gives a stronger sense of belonging than having the barista remember your name and order?</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://sureimmigration.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/david-clarke-DRtKiuN9_Mk-unsplash-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-56783" srcset="https://sureimmigration.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/david-clarke-DRtKiuN9_Mk-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://sureimmigration.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/david-clarke-DRtKiuN9_Mk-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sureimmigration.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/david-clarke-DRtKiuN9_Mk-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w, https://sureimmigration.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/david-clarke-DRtKiuN9_Mk-unsplash.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<h2>Play Sports</h2>



<p>Grab a soccer ball and get outside! Most of the parks in Canada are great for playing soccer with pals–both new and old. Check out local Facebook groups or ask your neighbour about some local soccer games.</p>



<h2>Support Other Immigrants</h2>



<p>When you are an immigrant in a country, there is always someone fresher off of the boat than you. Find those newer immigrants around you, maybe in your apartment building or where you work. They have similar interests to your own, and you can easily find common ground in a friendship.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>When planning a move to Canada, it is important to recognize the options available for immigration. French speakers have several options for immigrating to French Canada. By clarifying the different options, it is possible for individuals and families to select the best fit for their specific goals and needs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Federal Skilled Workers</h2>



<p>The Federal Skilled Workers Program for immigration into Quebec or other areas of Canada requires professional experience in technical jobs, managerial positions, or professional jobs in a home nation. Individuals must meet the minimum standards for education, work experience, and language ability in French or English to qualify for the visa. The program offers an immigration process with a work permit after moving to Canada.</p>



<h2>Apply for the Federal Trade Workers Program</h2>



<p>The Federal Trade Workers Program is similar to the Federal Skilled Workers Program; however, it does not set the same standards for education and professional work experience. The Express Entry option under a Federal Trade Workers program requires work experience in a specialized trade rather than a professional field. It sets similar standards for the immigration process in relation to language skills assessments, interviews, and application processes.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="711" src="https://sureimmigration.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/FrenchPicnic-1024x711.jpg" alt="French picnic in french canada" class="wp-image-56757" srcset="https://sureimmigration.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/FrenchPicnic-1024x711.jpg 1024w, https://sureimmigration.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/FrenchPicnic-300x208.jpg 300w, https://sureimmigration.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/FrenchPicnic-768x533.jpg 768w, https://sureimmigration.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/FrenchPicnic.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2>Canadian Experience Class Visas</h2>



<p>When seeking immigration pathways to Canada as a French speaker, you can consider an Experience Class Visa. The visa offers a pathway to permanent residency for individuals who have other types of visas and meet the eligibility requirements. Individuals must show proficiency in language skills and need at least one year of work experience in Canada. Any individual applying for an Experience Class Visa in Canada must not have refugee status and must be working legally in the country to qualify for the pathway to permanent residency.</p>



<h2>Apply for the Provincial Nominee Programs</h2>



<p>Provincial Nominee Programs differ from Express Entry visas and programs due to the role of the province in an individual&#8217;s legal status. A provincial government in Canada recommends the individual for a visa to work and live in a specific province. French speakers have opportunities to seek employment in a province outside of Quebec and obtain a visa or legal immigrant status through a nominee program. The standards and goals of a provincial government in Canada may vary, so the province may actively seek French-speaking immigrants or may look for individuals with specific skills and work experience.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://sureimmigration.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/French-Flag-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-56758" srcset="https://sureimmigration.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/French-Flag-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://sureimmigration.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/French-Flag-300x225.jpg 300w, https://sureimmigration.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/French-Flag-768x576.jpg 768w, https://sureimmigration.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/French-Flag-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://sureimmigration.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/French-Flag.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2>Obtain Student Visas</h2>



<p>Student visas offer an opportunity for French-speaking immigrants to start a life in Canada. A student visa differs from other types of visas due to the goal of the individual. Since the individual is seeking an education, it offers greater leniency in relation to work experience and educational standards. An individual may consider a visa during an undergraduate program or an advanced degree program. The visa may set limitations on work opportunities, so students should evaluate the standards related to a visa before applying for a student visa. The visa may allow students to live in Canada legally while obtaining a degree and then apply for Express Entry visas or another immigrant status after graduation.</p>



<p>Immigrating to Canada as a French-speaking professional or student may seem complex. By working with an immigration agency to clarify the best option for individual needs, goals, and work experience, it is possible to move to Canada. <strong>For more details about immigration options or to start working on an appropriate visa, contact us today at inquiry@sureimmigration.com or visit our <a href="http://sureimmigration.com/contact-us" data-type="URL" data-id="sureimmigration.com/contact-us">contact us</a> page.</strong></p><p>The post <a href="https://sureimmigration.com/5-ways-for-french-speakers-to-immigrate-to-canada/">5 Ways for French Speakers to Immigrate to Canada</a> first appeared on <a href="https://sureimmigration.com">Sure Immigration</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Immigration to Canada is changing as the country aims to bring in new immigrants at record rates. In 2021, the country has seen positive changes to the immigration system that focus on bringing in more residents. By looking back at 2021 in the new year, it is possible to recognize the major milestones that may impact your goals to immigrate.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="welcoming-a-record-number-of-immigrants">Welcoming a Record Number of Immigrants</h2>



<p>When looking at immigration in Canada for 2021, the major milestone to consider is the rate of immigration. Canada was able to stay on track for immigration goals in 2021 and welcomed 401,000 new permanent residents. Despite challenges related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the country was able to keep up with immigration goals.</p>



<h2 id="offering-express-entry-for-skilled-workers">Offering Express Entry for Skilled Workers</h2>



<p>A review of 2021 shows that Express Entry played a key role in reaching immigration goals for the year. The Express Entry program focuses on encouraging individuals to apply for a visa based on their skills and expertise. It offers three types of visas based on the work experience of the individual. Any individual with three or more years of work experience in Canada may apply for Express Entry visas. It also offers opportunities for individuals with work experience in other countries. Skilled workers may gain additional points for Express Entry if they apply for the Provincial Nominee Program to a specific province.</p>

<h2 id="offering-express-entry-for-skilled-workers">Immigrating Through the Provincial Nominee Program</h2>



<p>The Provincial Nominee Program allowed more individuals to immigrate to Canada when compared to previous years. The program improves opportunities to immigrate when individuals meet specific needs within a province. For example, a province may target skilled workers in a specific industry or college-age students. Immigrating through the Provincial Nominee Program ensures that you are able to fill a role that the province needs for the local and provincial economy.</p>



<h2 id="offering-express-entry-for-skilled-workers">The New Immigration Minister</h2>



<p>A key highlight of 2021 in Canadian immigration is the new Immigration Minister. The Honourable Sean Frasier began working as the Immigration Minister in 2021 and played a critical role in reaching country-wide goals for permanent residency among immigrants to the country. He set clear goals for permanent residency and focused on immigrants who were already in the country on work visas or similar visas. By focusing on residents with valid visas and work experience in the country, Canada was able to work on a fast-tracked process for permanent residency.</p>



<h2 id="offering-express-entry-for-skilled-workers">Addressing the Crisis in Afghanistan</h2>



<p>While Canadian immigration has had many positive changes throughout 2021 to welcome new residents, the response to the crisis in Afghanistan had an impact on the system. The country has worked to resettle 40,000 Afghan refugees in 2021 and plans to continue working on resettlement and refugee programs in upcoming years. Steps were taken to bring in vulnerable families and individuals from Afghanistan in the wake of the crisis abroad.</p>



<p>The highlights of Canadian immigration in 2021 show a positive trend for individuals who want to move to the country. By reaching immigration goals in 2021, the Canadian Immigration Minister has shown that he is willing to take the appropriate steps to meet demands for skilled workers in the country.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Do you know what's even more beautiful than Canada's Rocky Mountains, Niagara Falls, breathtaking views, and old university buildings? Canada's unique Parents and Grandparents Program (PGP). Because what could be more beautiful than being able to reunite with your loved ones?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="what-are-the-eligibility-requirements">So, What exactly is this pNP thing?</h2>



<p>The Parents and Grandparents Program (PGP) is a program run by the Canadian government that allows Canadian citizens, permanent residents, and people who are registered as Indians under the Canadian Indian Act to sponsor their parents or grandparents.</p>



<p>This program is a win-win situation both for Canada and for its immigrants. It is based on two key elements &#8211; the importance of family &#8211; which has only gotten clearer during the pandemic &#8211; and the contribution of immigrants to the success of the country.</p>



<p>Canada is taking drastic steps to ensure the well-being of its immigrants by providing them the opportunity to thrive in the country &#8211; and the country, in turn, benefits from having satisfied immigrants.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="what-are-the-eligibility-requirements">What are the eligibility requirements?</h2>



<p><em>There are certain criteria that need to be met to apply for the PGP, and we strongly advise that you check your eligibility before submitting a sponsoring request.&nbsp;</em></p>

<h2 id="the-application-process">The application process</h2>



<p><em>*Important note &#8211; The application process for 2021 will be different since the applicants will be randomly chosen from 2020&#8217;s pool of potential applicants. There will be no option to apply to sponsor your family members for 2021&#8217;s draw if you haven&#8217;t applied in 2020*</em></p>
