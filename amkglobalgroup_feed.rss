			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Mechanics and Auto Technicians jobs are high in Canada, there are some ways to immigrate to Canada as a Mechanic or Auto Technician.</span></p>
<h4><b>Express Entry</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Express Entry system is designed to assist talented workers who want to work in the country by managing Canada&#8217;s three federal economic immigration programmes. In addition, the CRS (Comprehensive Ranking System) is a point-based system that considers your age, abilities, education, and work experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After creating an online Express Entry profile, you will be included in a draw pool that occurs every day. You will be considered in a draw pool held every two weeks once you have created an online Express Entry profile. The top applicants will then be chosen to obtain an ITA (Invitation to Apply) for Canadian permanent residence.</span></p>
<h4><b>Program for Federal Skilled Trades</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can immigrate to Canada as a Mechanic or Auto Technician under the Federal Skilled Trades Program, which is run by the Express Entry platform. Major Group 73 comprises all maintenance and equipment operating trades and includes Mechanics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To qualify for this program, you must meet the following requirements:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Possess certification of qualification issued by a provincial agency OR a valid job offer from a Canadian company for at least one year.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Possess an acceptable Canadian Language Benchmark score for French and English (level 4 for writing + reading and level 5 for listening + speaking).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before applying, have at least two years of job experience; and</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Possess the capacity to prove your expertise and abilities in your field.</span></li>
</ul>

			<h4><b>Provincial Nominee Program</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suppose you are qualified and have a legitimate job offer in demand in a particular province or territory. In that case, you may be eligible to work in the country under the Provincial Nominee Program. Each province or territory has a unique PNP created to address that region&#8217;s labour market demands. Therefore, while Mechanics and Auto technicians might be in need in Alberta, Saskatchewan, or Manitoba, they might not be in Ontario. It is crucial because the lists of the most in-demand professions are constantly changing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your application is accepted, you will obtain a province nomination worth 600 CRS points, which will almost certainly result in an ITA for Canadian permanent residence.</span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each province and territory establishes its requirements for certification. It is possible to become certified as an automotive service technician in British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Newfoundland and Labrador, the Yukon, the Northwest Territories, and Nunavut, but it is not legally needed. You do not need to complete an apprenticeship and obtain a Certificate of Qualification (or comparable certification).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without attending school, becoming a Mechanic is not possible in other provinces. This is because the automotive industry is a required trade in certain regions, emphasizing that you need </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a license to be a Mechanic.</span></p>

			<h2><b>What is the Red Seal test?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Red Seal Exam is a test that evaluates your understanding of trade and commerce. Each province and territory use it to grant a Red Seal endorsement. In most cases section, organizations qualify tradespeople using the Red Seal Test. It resembles the &#8220;final test&#8221; in many ways for skilled workers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each question is multiple-choice, with the same significance. The four possible answers have only one correct answer and three incorrect answers.</span></p>
<h4><b>Red SealTest Format Highlights</b></h4>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>Per test, 100 to 150 questions.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>Exam time is limited to four hours.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>Questions with Many Options (equal points).</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>One question provides four alternative options (A, B, C, or D).</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>The cutoff is 70%.</li>
</ul>
<h4><b>Factors for Red Seal Canada Eligibility</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most probably, many individuals want to know if the red seal programme is limited to residents of Canada or if individuals in countries can also make use of it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, suppose you are a skilled worker who received your training outside Canada. In that case, you must possess the necessary credentials and work experience to qualify for the red seal test.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some immigration specialists claim that you need to meet specific requirements, including;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>Competitor or Trade Qualification (experienced trade workers),</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>Apprentice (completing an apprenticeship programme in Canada) (completing an apprenticeship programme in Canada),</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>Journeyperson (not yet certified as Journeyman in Canada),</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>4-6 years of professional experience.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>A significant trade certificate</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>Diploma proof.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Importantly, self-employed skilled workers can obtain trade certification by demonstrating their qualifications if they are qualified tradesperson who resides anywhere other than Canada, such as India, the Philippines, Pakistan, China, etc. Then, you must submit an application for the Red Seal test as a challenger or trade qualification.</span></p>

			<p>Undoubtedly, Canadian cities are among the most attractive in the nation due to their friendly ethnic populations, pollution-free environment &amp; delightful climate throughout the year. Its diverse options for studying, working &amp; becoming a citizen has made Canada the most popular destination for individuals &amp; family planning to settle abroad.</p>
<p>We are sure you may have thought about obtaining permanent residency in Canada if you want to study and work there, right?</p>
<p>However, to obtain specific visas, you must show documentation of your language proficiency in English or French, the two Official Languages of Canada, to ensure that you can communicate well. And for that, you must take the IELTS General Training test, the preferred test for immigration to Canada, to verify your English language skills.</p>
<p>So, before we dive deep into IELTS and its training, let&#8217;s first understand what IELTS exam for Canada is and its importance.</p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To move, study, or work in a country where the dominant language is English, you must pass IELTS (International English Language Testing System).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Your ability to Read, Speak, and Write and Listen to English will be assessed during the test.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Additionally, IELTS scores are given on a scale from 1 to 9. You can provide IELTS on computer or paper, and it is the only high-stakes language exam accepted for immigration in Canada and some other countries. </span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400">IELTS is the world&#8217;s most widely accepted English language test, trusted by the immigration authorities in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the UK. It is recognized by over 11,000 organizations worldwide.</span></p>
<h3>The IELTS exam for Canada improves your English language skills.</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It evaluates four language abilities: Listening, speaking, Writing, and Reading. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">In addition, through our regulated team of consultants, you can acquire various study strategies to improve your English language abilities.</span></p>
<h3>Importance in real-world communication.</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The speaking test involves live contact between you and the examiner, unlike other exams that use an automated speaking test. This assists in simulating real-world conversations, such as those you would have with neighbours and coworkers, better preparing you for life abroad.</span></p>
<h3>The IELTS exam for Canada assists in achieving your life&#8217;s long-term objectives.</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You can create clear goals and get more motivated to study by taking the exam. It&#8217;s simple to put off studying or wait until the last minute when you don&#8217;t have defined objectives and goals. Having clear objectives for the test will motivate you to explore every day and improve your English skills.</span></p>
<h3>Taking the IELTS exam for Canada can increase your job prospects.</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Excellent communication skills are essential in the modern world, as English is the primary language in 55 nations. If you demonstrate that you have a solid command of the language, you could be able to pursue a career overseas!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Many nations, including Canada, demand that you speak more advanced English. Instead, to work in these nations, you must prove that you are a &#8220;competent&#8221; language user by passing the test with a specific score.</span></p>

			<h3>Eligibility for IELTS exam for Canada</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyone can take the exam regardless of age, gender, ethnicity, nationality, or religion; however, individuals under 16 should not.</span></p>
<h4>Test Format for IELTS</h4>
<h5><span style="font-weight: 400">IELTS has two aspects: </span></h5>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Academic </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">General Training. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You can take Academic online at home or any private location with a reliable internet connection and on paper or a computer in a testing facility.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You can take identical Speaking and Listening tests for Academic and General Training but distinct Reading and Writing tests. So make sure you get ready for the right kind of test.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are no gaps between the Listening, Reading, and Writing components of any IELTS exam; they are all finished on the same day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, arranging the Speaking test up to a week before or after the other exams is possible. Your Speaking test will typically happen before other tests if you schedule this exam online.</span></p>

			<h3>How to prepare for the Canadian IELTS exam for your Work permit &amp; PR?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We have put together a list of practical actions to help you get started because we know how intimidating and overwhelmed you may feel as you prepare for your test. Here are some tips to assist you with your exam.</span></p>
<h4><b>Take a practice test.</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before studying, take a practice test to determine where you need improvement. This phase aims to help you evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of your initial planning. It&#8217;s crucial to build on your strengths and improve your areas of weakness to prepare well for the exam.</span></p>
<h4><b>Recognize the exam&#8217;s time limits.</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As you develop a better understanding of the test&#8217;s layout, your chances of passing it successfully within the allocated time rise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To get used to the test&#8217;s pace, practise under controlled conditions.</span></p>
<h4><b>Understand the test&#8217;s structure.</b></h4>

			<h2>What is a suitable IELTS score for immigration to Canada?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The required IELTS score for your Visa depends on every application. </span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">For example, if you are applying for a Study Permit in Canada, you have to score the minimum required score for the program you are applying for in that particular college/ university; typically, this would be an average of 6.5 for IELTS Academic. IELTS is not mandatory if you are applying for a Work Permit Visa; however, taking the exam always strengthens your application, which is always advisable. (Normally 5-6 bands in IELTS General) </span></p>
<p><b><i>If you have working experience in hospitality, reach out to us at <a href="mailto:info@amk.global">info@amk.global</a> and get started on your immigration journey.</i></b></p>
<h4><b>How long is the validity of my IELTS score?</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">IELTS score validity only lasts two years to preserve the information&#8217;s originality. In a given year, candidates can take the exam as often as they choose.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Students must prove their language proficiency to study, live, or work in English-speaking countries. Students can use the International English Language Testing System to aid their studies. In addition, students who intend to pursue further education overseas must be familiar with this test&#8217;s components, including test Validity.</span></p>
<h4><b>IELTS is a requirement for Canadian PR.</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">IELTS is not strictly necessary to obtain Canadian PR. Think about it this way: For those applying for economic immigration, such as those who do so through Express Entry, passing a language test is just one step toward permanent residence in Canada.</span></p>
<h4><b>What is the IELTS score required for Canadian PR?</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The minimum IELTS requirement to apply for Canadian PR depends on the program you wish to submit your application (You can submit your application through Express Entry Program, where you have three subcategories, FSW, FST, CEC and PNP( Provincial Nominee Programs).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suppose you are applying as a candidate for the Federal Skilled Worker program under the Express Entry Category. In that case, you must provide language test scores equivalent to or better than the Canadian Language Benchmark (CLB) 7 to come under for Entry into the Express Entry pool of candidates. For example, a CLB 7 is equivalent to an IELTS speaking, reading, writing, and listening score of 6.0.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You must score 6.0 to apply as a Canadian Experience Class candidate under Express Entry for NOC 0 or A levels. However, if your line of work falls under the NOC B skill level, you may be able to join the pool with a speaking, writing, and listening score of 5.0 and a reading score of 4.0.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Candidates for skilled federal trades may be qualified to join the pool if they receive scores of 4.0 in writing and speaking, 3.5 in reading, and 4.5 in listening, which equate to a CLB level 4. The result has been a new lowering of the bar.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Want to know more about Canadian PR? Contact us at <a href="mailto:info@amk.global">info@amk.global</a> or visit our page to learn more.</i></b></p>
<h4><b>How important is the IELTS test to obtain a Work Permit in Canada?</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Using Express Entry, anyone can easily immigrate to Canada. Talented immigrants who wish to live permanently in Canada and contribute to its growth are the target audience for this program. A strong IELTS score can significantly increase a candidate&#8217;s chances of being chosen for Express Canada entrance. However, candidates must also submit various other documents to support their Education, Experience and Age.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although Work Permits do not require IELTS according to immigration requirements, it is clear that IELTS is still a requirement for submitting your PR application. Hence it&#8217;s always better to have your IELTS done prior and attach it to your Work Permit application for better results, in addition to the other requirements. Therefore, whether applying for a Work Permit or a PR, one should consider including their score because it would significantly improve their chances of getting accepted.</span></p>

			<p><b>Pay close attention to the details-</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Throughout the whole cooking process, great attention to detail is essential. Failure to follow the kilograms, cooking temperatures, and other guidelines can lose control over the final dish. Therefore, the serving stage requires a high level of perfection.</span></p>
<p><b>A dedication to excellence- </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The chef&#8217;s most crucial responsibility is food quality. Everything needs commitment to excellence, from choosing the best ingredients to using them in the dish. Consequently, the chef&#8217;s responsibility is to serve the best quality to their customer, even if budget constraints prevent them.</span></p>
<p><b>Creativity- </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chefs must follow all standards regarding presentation, taste, menu, and creativity on the plate. They&#8217;ll also need to think outside the box when designing the kitchen layout. In addition, sometimes customers come to a restaurant because of the chef&#8217;s inventive reputation and the creativity in his/her work.</span></p>
<p><b>Teamwork</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; People from many areas of life come together over a shared passion for food. So, excellent teamwork skills must help bind the team together with great enthusiasm. Like, it&#8217;s a plus if you can work and get along with your coworkers.</span></p>
<p><b>Leadership Qualities</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Experienced chefs should lead their teams and get the most out of them. Thus they must be able to make orders and have them carried out promptly. Simultaneously, they must maintain a positive mood in the kitchen.</span></p>
<p><b>Organization-</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Working in a kitchen may be a highly hectic atmosphere; therefore, you must be able to keep maintain all times. In addition, during service, they may be required to mentor and coach junior staff members while ensuring that everything goes well.</span></p>

<p><b>Ways to Immigrate to Canada as a Chef &amp; Cook</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The economy has experienced significant improvements and growth through the programs like the Express Entry system and Provincial Nominee Programs that make it easier for skilled and semi-skilled workers to live and work in Canada.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have a choice to choose from over 70 different immigration programs and visas as a skilled or semi-skilled worker. They provide you with a more significant opportunity to establish a new life overseas for yourself and your loved ones. However, the procedure can confuse many possibilities, especially if you aren&#8217;t sure which programs are appropriate for you and will assist you with your immigration and visa application.</span></p>
<p><b>Express Entry</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Express Entry system oversees Canada&#8217;s three federal economic immigration programs targeted toward qualified professionals seeking to reside and work in the country. It depends on the CRS (Comprehensive Ranking System), a point-based system that evaluates candidates based on age, language abilities, education, and work experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You must have a skill type 0 or a level A or B to be eligible for the Express Entry system. For example, chefs and cooks are categorized as level B, implying that they could be qualified to apply to any Express entry program. To participate in the Express Entry draw pool, you must create an online profile.</span></p>
<p><b>Provincial Nominee Program </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This immigration route allows foreign skilled or semi-skilled employees to work in Canada. Eligible candidates should have a valid job offer from a Canadian employer that LMIA supports to qualify for PNP. Kindly remember that each Canadian province has its PNP with in-demand occupation lists to meet the needs of industry and the labor market. Consequently, the PNP in-demand employment listings vary based on the demand for skilled labor in certain provinces. As a result, candidates should obtain assistance from a reputable immigration consultant, such as AMK Global Group, to know recent trends and developments.</span></p>
<p><b>Atlantic Immigration Pilot.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Atlantic Immigration Program allows skilled foreign workers and international graduates of a Canadian university to work and live in one of four Atlantic provinces of Canada: New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, or Newfoundland and Labrador. Employers can use the program to find competent individuals for roles they haven&#8217;t been able to fill locally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, there are requirements such as work experience, job offers, language levels and educational qualifications, and obtaining enough settlement funds to immigrate to Canada. To be considered for this pilot, you must have at least one year of full-time, non-seasonal employment experience.</span></p>
<p><b>Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program (OINP)</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program is the province&#8217;s economic immigration program (OINP). Through Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada, it operates with the Canadian government (IRCC).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Foreign workers, international students, and anybody with the requisite abilities, experience, and education can submit nominations to the OINP.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The OINP seeks out and nominates permanent residents with the talents and competence that the Ontario economy requires. The Government of Canada makes the final decision on whether to approve the applications.</span></p>

			<p>Do you know, if you are planning to move to Canada, you will be required to undergo a medical test for Canadian immigration by a designated approved physician?</p>
<p>Whether you want to live in the country or visit the country temporarily, you will still be required to give a health exam before being issued a visa. Canada ensures to allow young skilled professionals who are fit and immensely contribute the knowledge and skills to the country&#8217;s economic growth.</p>
<p>Due to inappropriate health conditions, an individual may be considered medically inadmissible to Canada. Therefore, before visiting Canada, foreign individuals must overcome all such inadmissibility that can enable them to enter the country. Therefore, in this weekly blog, we are talking in depth about medical tests for Canadian Immigration. <em>Keep Reading!</em></p>
<p><strong style="color: #222222; font-family: Poppins, sans-serif; font-size: 30px;">What are Medical tests required for Canadian immigration?</strong></p>
<p>According to your age, you may be asked to undergo chest x-rays and laboratory tests at a clinic or a lab. It is a standard screening, and any abnormal results will be addressed with you by the doctor.</p>
<p>Based on your medical exam results, they may refer you to a specialist for additional testing. Additionally, to avoid delays in processing your medical examination, you must complete this request as soon as possible.</p>
<p>If a Government of Canada-approved COVID-19 vaccine is available, your panel physician may administer it to you. In addition, the panel physician will also note if you got the COVID-19 vaccine during your exam.</p>
<p>Consequently, you should also bring proof of vaccination to your appointment- either a physical copy or an electronic copy. Along with it, keep a copy of the vaccination record that the panel physician gave you.</p>

<p><strong style="color: #222222; font-family: Poppins, sans-serif; font-size: 30px;">Why is medical tests for Canadian immigration necessary?</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph -->An Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRCC) panel of physicians examines applicants to determine whether they should be denied entry into Canada because of medical conditions.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph -->In an IRCC-approved exam, your panel physician determines your health history, physical examination, and other tests. If your physician requires additional information about your health, they may refer you to a specialist for tests. In addition, you have the legal right to bring a supervisor to your appointment if you like.</p>

<p><strong style="color: #222222; font-family: Poppins, sans-serif; font-size: 30px;">Medical Test Requirements for Canada Permanent Resident</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph -->Depending on whether a person is asking for temporary residence (workers, students, and visitors) or permanent residence, some specific requirements must need to apply.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph -->In addition, a health exam is not necessary for temporary residents choosing to stay for less than six months unless they plan to work in a specialized area. Such jobs comprise employment that needs to maintain public health, including frequent interaction with individuals. Below are some examples of such jobs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Workers in child care programs.</li>
<li>Workers in primary and secondary schools.</li>
<li>Workers in health care settings.</li>
<li>Medical students.</li>
<li>Agriculturists from reputed or designated countries</li>
<li>Child care workers and teachers in elementary or secondary schools.</li>
<li>People who give children care at home.</li>
<li>Workers in the clinical laboratory.</li>
</ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph -->But not limited to this, many other job titles also ask to take a medical exam for immigration before moving to Canada. Consequently, those agriculture workers who have already worked in certain countries for at least six months must undergo a health exam. Also, temporary residents who plan to stay only for a few months in Canada must undergo an exam to meet the criteria mentioned below.</p>
<ul>
<li>You will be working in a field where you will be responsible for protecting the public&#8217;s health.</li>
<li>You are applying for the Super Visas of your parents and grandparents.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong style="color: #222222; font-family: Poppins, sans-serif; font-size: 24px;">Validity of the Medical Test for Canadian Immigration?</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph -->For an individual who passes a medical exam for immigration outside Canada, the certificate will be applicable only for 12 months from the date of the assessment filed by a health officer or dedicated staff. However, there is no expiry date for the exam validity for admissible applicants.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph -->After receiving your results from the panel physician, it takes about three months to process your application as a permanent resident.</p>

<p>Students prefer to study abroad in Canada for a variety of reasons! While you already tumbled upon your interest in studying abroad in Canada, we&#8217;ll tell you the reasons why it is the best place to study abroad in 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;Here’s our top 5 list on Why Canada is the best place to study abroad!</p>



<h3><strong>1) World-class education in Canada&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>You really can access amazing institutions highly ranked on the global rankings list. For example, the University of British Columbia, University of Toronto, and McGill consistently place in the top 20 universities in the world. The University of Saskatchewan is ranked first for water resources research, and Simon Fraser University ranks number one in Canada for innovation! In Canada, you’ll have small class sizes, hands-on learning opportunities, and co-op placements that allow you to work in your field before graduation, which gives you a significant leg up on your competition in terms of job readiness, competence, experience &#8211; and knowledge! This is a huge benefit to studying abroad in Canada and our #1 reason Canada is the best place to study abroad.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>2) Reasonably priced education!</strong></h3>



<p>We know studying abroad can be expensive. The US has some of the most expensive programs in the world, UK and Australia aren’t far behind. Fees &amp; Costs are significant reasons while shortlisting a country when exploring the best places to study abroad.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Canada, education is reasonably priced!</p>



<p>Students and their families know this and take advantage of it. You can study for a 4-year degree at a Canadian equivalent “Ivy League-Esque school,” for a fraction of the cost of a US school. What a deal!</p>



<p>Thus Canada is the best place to study abroad because your studying abroad dream doesn’t need to break the bank. In Canada, you can make an affordable option.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Looking for the best place to study abroad? Canada has everything you&#8217;re looking for. Besides, we have exciting programs for you to explore in Canada’s best universities.&nbsp;<br>Book a free consultation with our Director of International Students, and reap the benefits of AMK Global&#8217;s free consultation. <strong><em>Book from here.</em></strong></p>



<h3><strong>3) The people are friendly!</strong></h3>



<p>It is a known fact that the Canadian people are friendly and kind. You’ve seen unofficial polls everywhere, from magazines to Twitter, who survey a ton of people to determine how people</p>



<p>from different nations interact with others globally – and Canadians always come out on top as</p>



<p>the friendliest bunch! The truth is, Canadians exercise politeness, respect for others, and genuine kindness to help their neighbor. This can be considered excessive kindness to some or just an average day to a Canadian.</p>



<p>When a student leaves his home country what comforts &amp; makes their life easy are the people they live with. Canada is ranked #1 in the world in terms of quality of living &amp; which encourages every student looking for the best places to study abroad. Quality of life consists of various factors like culture, freedom, people &amp; behavior. We have discussed the Canadian lifestyle in our previous blog.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>4) There is a ton to see and do!</strong></h3>



<p>There is always something AMAZING to see and do from coast to coast! Each province has something spectacular to offer students who study abroad. Check this out: BC has a bear </p>



<p>rainforest! In Alberta, you can explore the Rocky Mountains. Saskatchewan has dinosaur exhibits, and Manitoba has the Forks of the River! You can always plan to see the skydome, a</p>



<p>Broadway show or venture to Niagara Falls in Ontario, whale watching in Quebec, and seeing the Atlantic provinces&#8217; gorgeous fall colors. The territories offer incredible northern lights and wildlife. Each city has its own vibe, tourist attractions, and nightlife. Seriously, there is</p>



<p>ALWAYS something to do.</p>



<p>What&#8217;s your academic life without some adventure, exploring &amp; making memories in one of the world&#8217;s most beautiful destinations. Yes, it&#8217;s the best place to study abroad and the one that gives you a sweeping experience of living overseas—but also a happy academic life &amp; of course gram-worthy photos.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>5) 4 seasons of fun!</strong></h3>



<p>Canadians really get out to explore the wild outdoors, and you should too! We know a quick walk around the block can do wonders for your mental health. You can really recharge with summer.</p>



<p>Swim in Lake Ontario, or a game of beach volleyball in Vancouver. You can take on the Cabot Trail in Nova Scotia for a great weekend hike! I personally love a wintery walk around Wascana Lake in Regina or exploring Banff National Park. We always encourage students to get out and explore the place they’re living. That means learning to love winter too! There are a ton of sports you can play to help pass the colder days with a smile on your face, like skating, snowboarding, tobogganing, and afterward, enjoying a cup of hot chocolate.</p>



<p>Have you explored Canada? Tell us where below and what you think makes Canada the best place to study abroad!</p>

			<h3><strong>Job Security in Canada</strong></h3>
<p>One of the crucial benefits you get while being employed in Canada is access to Employment Insurance (EI). Having access to employment insurance means you will get certain financial benefits if you lose your job. This is one of the standard benefits given to all the workers in Canada. In addition, you can get up to 35% of your average weekly earnings if you qualify for employment insurance (EI). However, suppose you lose your job, and there aren&#8217;t any jobs available. In that case, you will also be available to claim employment insurance benefits, but this may differ as per your occupation of the industry you are working with.</p>

			<h3><strong>Paid Sick Leave</strong></h3>
<p>Do you know if you have to take sick leave in Canada and you will be covered financially as some companies provide their employee&#8217;s short-term disability finances? However, the government also offers a standard Employment Insurance sickness benefit to ensure your finances while on your sick leave. In addition, if you are unable to work for medical reasons, like injury, quarantine, illness, or other medical condition, you could claim sick benefit for up to 15 weeks and get a good percent of your salary.</p>

			<h3><strong>Canada Pension Plan (CPP)</strong></h3>
<p>The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) includes that both employee and employer can contribute towards the pension scheme where the employees are entitled to. It is a standard work benefit that ensures an individual will get money over the <strong>retirement age</strong> of 60 once they retire from the company or organization.</p>
<p>This scheme is compulsory for all employees as it ensures saving plans for them with valid work visas. Usually, when a person retires, they often worry about money, so the Canada Pension Plan allowed having access to a portion of your earned income for the rest of your life as you have made it.</p>

<h2 id="despite-these-benefits-you-can-also-get-excellent-employee-perks"><strong>Despite these benefits, you can also get excellent employee perks &#8211;</strong></h2>



<p>If you read till here, here’s your bonus! Along with the advantages mentioned above, you can also gain various employee perks working in Canada. Let’s have a look at those perks:-</p>



<p><strong>Online Digital Fitness &amp; Health Platforms</strong></p>



<p>Online digital fitness and health platforms are an increasingly popular low-cost option for mental health and wellbeing. These programs are usually easily accessible and available to every employee as needed. These platforms typically include rewards, gamification, health risk assessments, targeted health regulations, and related challenges.</p>



<p>Consequently, some platforms can be bundled up with rewards and recognition. But, at the same time, other platforms put less focus on traditional wellness rather than training the brain to maintain positivity.</p>



<p>The main objective here is to help the employees be happy to engage themselves more and become more productive.</p>



<p><strong>Health Coaching</strong></p>



<p>Here, health coaching works well in maintaining a person’s overall health. It includes health navigation, health guiding, and health risk assessments. Additionally, many programs have already helped employees’ conditions, including high cholesterol, back pain, stress, depression, neck pain, and musculoskeletal disorders that they usually face in their day-to-day work experience.</p>



<p><strong>Corporate Health Challenges</strong></p>



<p>Another thing that includes employee perks is corporate health challenges. It has team-based individual challenges that carry membership fees. In addition, many programs also use wearable devices to track the fitness data of the employee.</p>



<p><strong>Health Fairs</strong></p>



<p>Health fairs are interactive educational events designed to offer essential medical screening and preventive medicine to the Employees at work. In addition, these fairs usually promote health and wellbeing initiatives that are available for the employees, including perks, fitness training, wellness, and a subsidized meal program.</p>



<p><strong>Virtual Care</strong></p>



<p>Virtual care is also available for employees, where they can chat or video call anytime. There are no time limits on that. Employees can also reach out to mental health specialists, naturopaths, and nutritionists. An online doctor provides an appointment charge attached. The only intent here is 24/7 health care access across all the places in Canada.</p>

<p>Leadership training on mental health is also available as under employee perks. It includes mindfulness, a stress reduction program, and anti-stigma campaigns.
